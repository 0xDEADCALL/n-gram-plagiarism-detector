When you pull up the plunger, you leave an empty space; you shove the air out of the pump or
syringe ahead of the plunger. The air outside, pressing on the water, forces it up into this
empty space from which the air has been pushed. But air pressure cannot force water up even
into a perfect vacuum farther than about 33 feet. If your glass pump were, say, 40 feet long,
the water would follow the plunger up for a little over 30 feet, but nothing could suck it
higher; for by the time it reaches that height it is pushing down with its own weight as hard
as the air is pressing on the water below. No suction pump, or siphon, however perfect, will
ever lift water more than about 33 feet, and it will do well if it draws water up 28 or 30
feet. This is because a perfect vacuum cannot be made. There is always some water vapor formed
by the water evaporating a little, and there is always a small amount of air that has been
dissolved in water, both of which partly fill the space above the water and press down a little
on the water within the pump.

If you had a straw over 33 feet long, and if some one held a glass of lemonade for you down
near the sidewalk while you leaned over from the roof of a three-story building with your long
straw, you could not possibly drink the lemonade. The air pressure would not be great enough
to lift it so high, no matter how hard you sucked,--that is, no matter how perfect a vacuum
you made in the upper part of the straw. The lemonade would rise part way, and then your straw
would be flattened by the pressure outside.

Some days the air can force water up farther in a tube than it can on other days. If it can
force the water up 33 feet today, it will perhaps be able to force it up only 30 feet immediately
before a storm. And if it forces water up 33 feet at sea level, it may force it up only 15
or 20 feet on a high mountain, for on a mountain there is much less air above to make pressure.
The pressure of the air is different in different places; where the air is heavy and pressing
hard, we say the pressure is high; where the air is light and not pressing so hard, we call
the pressure low. A place where the air is heavy is called an area of high pressure; where
it is light, an area of low pressure. (See Section 44.)

WHAT MAKES WINDS? It is because the air does not press equally all the time and everywhere
that we have winds. Naturally, if the air is pressing harder in one place than in another,
the lower air will be pushed sidewise in the areas of high pressure and will rush to the areas
where there is less pressure. And air rushing from one place to another is called wind.

    APPLICATION 4. A man had two water reservoirs, which stood
    at the same level, one on each side of a hill. The hill
    between them was about 50 feet high. One reservoir was full,
    and the other was empty. He wanted to get some of the water
    from the full reservoir into the empty one. He did not have a
    pump to force the water from one to the other, but he did have
    a long hose, and could have bought more. His hose was long
    enough to reach over the top of the hill, but not long enough
    to go around it. Could he have siphoned the water from one
    reservoir to the other? Would he have had to buy more hose?

    APPLICATION 5. Two boys were out hiking and were very
    thirsty. They came to a deserted farm and found a deep well;
    it was about 40 feet down to the water. They had no pump,
    but there was a piece of hose about 50 feet long. One boy
    suggested that they drop one end of the hose down to the water
    and suck the water up, but the other said that that would not
    work--the only way would be to lower the hose into the water,
    close the upper end, pull the hose out and let the water pour
    out of the lower end of the hose into their mouths. A stranger
    came past while the boys were arguing, and said that neither
    way would work; that although the hose was long enough, the
    water was too far down to be raised in either way. He advised
    the boys to find a bucket and to use the hose as a rope for
    lowering it. Who was right?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    EXPLANATORY NOTE. In the inference exercises in this book,
    there is a group of facts for you to explain. They can always
    be explained by one or more of the principles studied, like
    gravitation, water seeking its own level, or air pressure. If
    asked to explain why sucking through a straw makes soda water
    come up into your mouth, for instance, you should not merely
    say "air pressure," but should tell why you think it is air
    pressure that causes the liquid to rise through the straw. The
    answer should be something like this: "The soda water comes
    up into your mouth because the sucking takes the air pressure
    away from the top of the soda water that is in the straw. This
    leaves the air pressing down only on the surface of the soda
    water in the glass. Therefore, the air pressure pushes the
    soda water up into the straw and into your mouth where the
    pressure has been removed by sucking." Sometimes, when you
    have shown that you understand the principles very well,
    the teacher may let you take a short cut and just name the
    principle, but this will be done only after you have proved by
    a number of full answers that you thoroughly understand each
    principle named.

    Some of the following facts are accounted for by air pressure;
    some by water seeking its own level; others by gravitation.
    See if you can tell which of the three principles explains
    each fact:

    1. Rain falls from the clouds.

    2. After rain has soaked into the sides of mountains it runs
    underground and rises, at lower levels, in springs.

    3. When there are no springs near, people raise the water from
    underground with suction pumps.

    4. As fast as the water is pumped away from around the bottom
    of a pump, more water flows in to replace it.

    5. After you pump water up, it flows down into your pail from
    the spout of the pump.

    6. You can drink lemonade through a straw.

    7. If a lemon seed sticks to the bottom of your straw, the
    straw flattens out when you suck.

    8. When you pull your straw out to remove the seed, there is
    no hole left in the lemonade; it closes right in after the
    straw.

    9. If you drop the seed, it falls to the floor.

    10. If you tip the glass to drink the lemonade, the surface
    of the lemonade does not tip with the glass, but remains
    horizontal.

SECTION 4. Sinking and floating: Displacement.

    What keeps a balloon up?

    What makes an iceberg float?

    Why does cork float on the water and why do heavier substances
    sink?

    If iron sinks, why do iron ships not sink?

Again let us imagine ourselves up in the place where gravitation has no effect. Suppose we
lay a nail on the surface of a bowl of water. It stays there and does not sink. This does not
seem at all surprising, of course, since the nail no longer has weight. But when we put a cork
in the midst of the water, it stays there instead of floating to the surface. This seems peculiar,
because the less a thing weighs the more easily it floats. So when the cork weighs nothing
at all, it seems that it should float better than ever. Of course there is some difficulty
in deciding whether it ought to float toward the part of the water nearest the floor or toward
the part nearest the ceiling, since there is no up or down; but one would think that it ought
somehow to get to the outside of the water and not stay exactly in the middle. If put on the
outside, however, it stays there as well.

A toy balloon, in the same way, will not go toward either the ceiling or the floor, but just
stays where it is put, no matter how light a gas it is filled with.

The explanation is as follows: For an object to float on the water or in the air, the water
or air must be heavier than the object. It is the water or air being pulled under the object
by gravity, that pushes it up. Therefore, if the air and water themselves weighed nothing,
of course they would be no heavier than the balloon or the cork; the air or water would then
not be pulled in under the balloon or cork by gravity, and so would not push them up, or aside.

WHY IRON SHIPS FLOAT. When people first talked about building iron ships, others laughed at
them. "Iron sinks," they said, "and your boats will go to the bottom of the sea." If the boats
were solid iron this would be true, for iron is certainly much heavier than water. But if the
iron is bent up at the edges,--as it is in a dish pan,--it has to push much more water aside
before it goes under than it would if it were flattened out. The water displaced, or pushed
aside, would have to take up as much room as was taken up by the pan and all the empty space
inside of it, before the edge would go under. Naturally this amount of water would weigh a
great deal more than the empty pan.

But suppose you should fill the dish pan with water, or suppose it leaked full. Then you would
have the weight of all the water in it added to the weight of the pan, and that would be heavy
enough to push aside the water in which it was floating and let the pan sink. This is why a
ship sometimes sinks when it springs a leak.

You may be able to see more clearly why an iron ship floats by this example: Suppose your iron
ship weighs 6000 tons and that the cargo and crew weigh another 1000 tons. The whole thing,
then, weighs 7000 tons. Now that ship is a big, bulky affair and takes up more space than 7000
tons of water does. As it settles into the water it pushes a great deal of water out of the
way, and after it sinks a certain distance it has pushed 7000 tons of water out of the way.
Since the ship weighs only 7000 tons, it evidently cannot push aside more than that weight
of water; so part of the ship stays above the water, and all there is left for it to do is
to float. If the ship should freeze solid in the water where it floated and then could be lifted
out of the ice by a huge derrick, you would find that you could pour exactly 7000 tons of water
into the hole where the ship had been.

But if you built your ship with so little air space in it that it took less room than 7000
tons of water takes, it could go clear under the water without pushing 7000 tons of water aside.
Therefore a ship of this kind would sink.

The earth's gravity is pulling on the ship and on the water. If the ship has displaced (pushed
aside) its own weight of water, gravity is pulling down on the water as hard as it is on the
ship; so the ship cannot push any more water aside, and if there is enough air space in it,
the ship floats.

Perhaps the easiest way to say it is like this: Anything that is lighter than the same volume
of water will float; since a cubic foot of wood weighs less than a cubic foot of water, the
wood will float; since a quart of oil is lighter than a quart of water, the oil will float;
since a pint of cream is lighter than a pint of milk, the cream will rise. In the same way,
anything that is lighter than the same volume of air will be pushed up by the air. When a balloon
with its passengers weighs less than the amount of air that it takes the place of at any one
time, it will go up. Since a quart of warm air weighs less than a quart of cold air, the warm
air will rise.

You can see how a heavy substance like water pushes a lighter one, like oil, up out of its
way, in the following experiment:

    EXPERIMENT 11. Fill one test tube to the brim with kerosene
    slightly colored with a little iodine. Fill another test tube
    to the brim with water, colored with a little blueing. Put a
    small square of cardboard over the test tube of water, hold it
    in place, and turn the test tube upside down. You can let go
    of the cardboard now, as the air pressure will hold it up. Put
    the mouth of the test tube of water exactly over the mouth of
    the test tube of kerosene. Pull the cardboard out from between
    the two tubes, or have some one else do this while you hold
    the two tubes mouth to mouth. If you are careful, you will not
    spill a drop. If nothing happens when the cardboard is pulled
    away, gently rock the two tubes, holding their mouths tightly
    together.

Oil is lighter than water, as you know, because you have seen a film of oil floating on water.
When you have the two test tubes in such a position that the oil and water can change, the
water is pulled down under the kerosene because gravity is pulling harder on the water than
it is pulling on the kerosene. The water, therefore, goes to the bottom and this forces the
kerosene up.

    APPLICATION 6. Three men were making a raft. For floats they
    meant to use some air-tight galvanized iron cylinders. One
    of them wanted to fill the cylinders with cork, "because," he
    said, "cork is what you put in life preservers and it floats
    better than anything I know of." "They'd be better with
    nothing in them at all," said a second. "Pump all the air
    out and leave vacuums. They're air-tight and they are strong
    enough to resist the air pressure." But the third man said,
    "Why, you've got to have some air in them to buoy them up.
    Cork would be all right, but it isn't as light as air; so air
    would be the best thing to fill them with."

    Which way would the floats have worked best?

    APPLICATION 7. A little girl was telling her class about
    icebergs. "They are very dangerous," she said, "and ships are
    often wrecked by running into them. You see, the sun melts
    the top off them so that all there is left is under water. The
    sailors can't see the ice under water, and so their ships
    run into it and are sunk." Another girl objected to this; she
    said, "That couldn't be; the ice would bob up as fast as the
    top melted." "No, it wouldn't," said a boy. "If that lower
    part wasn't heavier than water, it never would have stayed
    under at all. And if it was heavier at the beginning, it would
    still be heavier after the top melted off."

    Who was right?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    11. When you wash dishes, a cup often floats on top of the
    water, while a plate made of the same sort of china sinks to
    the bottom of the pan.

    12. If you put the cup in sidewise, it sinks.

    13. The water in the cup, when lying on its side, is exactly
    as high as the water in the dish pan.

    14. If you put a glass into the water, mouth first, the water
    cannot get up into the glass; if you tip it a little, there
    are bubbles in the water and some water enters the glass.

    15. If you let a dish slip while you are wiping it, it crashes
    to the floor.

    16. It is much harder to hold a large platter while you are
    wiping it than it is to hold a small butter plate.

    17. If you set a hot glass upside down on the oilcloth table
    cover, the oilcloth bulges up into it when the hot air and
    steam shrink and leave a partial vacuum within the glass.

    18. If you spill any of the dishwater on the floor, it
    flattens out.

    19. You may use a kind of soap that is full of invisible
    little air bubbles; if you do, the soap will float on top of
    the water.

    20. When you drop a dry dishcloth into water, it floats until
    all the pores are filled with water; then it sinks.

SECTION 5. How things are kept from toppling over: Stability.

    Why is it harder to keep your balance on stilts than on your
    feet?

    Why does a rowboat tip over more easily if you stand up in it?

In Pisa, Italy, there is a beautiful marble bell tower which leans over as if it were just
about to fall to the ground. Yet it has stood in this position for hundreds of years and has
never given a sign of toppling. The foundations on which it rested sank down into the ground
on one side while the tower was being built (it took over 200 years to build it), and this
made it tip. But the men who were building it evidently felt sure that it would not fall over
in spite of its tipping. They knew the law of stability.

All architects and engineers and builders have to take this law into consideration or the structures
they put up would topple over. And your body learned the law when you were a little over a
year old, or you never could have walked. It is worth while for your brain to know it, too,
because it is a very practical law that you can use in your everyday life.

If you wish to understand why the Leaning Tower of Pisa does not fall over, why it is hard
to walk on stilts, why a boat tips when a person stands up in it, why blocks fall when you
build too high with them, and how to keep things from tipping over, do the following experiment
and read the explanation that follows it:

    EXPERIMENT 12.[2] Unscrew the bell from a doorbell or a
    telephone. You will not harm it at all, and you can put it
    back after the experiment. Cut a sheet of heavy wrapping paper
    or light-weight cardboard about 5 × 9 inches. Roll this so as
    to make a cylinder about 5 inches high and as big around as
    the bell. Hold it in shape by pasting it or putting a couple
    of rubber bands around it. Cut two strips of paper about an
    inch wide and 8 inches long; lay these crosswise; lay the
    bell, round side down, on the center of the cross. Push a
    paper fastener through the hole in the bell (the kind shown in
    Figure 14) and through the crossed pieces of paper, spreading
    the fastener out so as to fasten the paper cross to the
    rounded side of the bell. Bend the arms of the cross up around
    the bell and paste them to the sides of the paper cylinder so
    that the bell makes a curved bottom to the cylinder, as shown
    in Figure 15.

[Footnote 2: TO THE TEACHER. If you have a laboratory, it is well to have this cylinder already
made for the use of all classes.]

Try to tip the cylinder over. Now stuff some crumpled paper loosely into the cylinder, filling
it to the top. Tip the cylinder again. Will it stay on its side now? Force all the crumpled
paper to the bottom of the cylinder. Now will it stay on its side? Take out the crumpled paper
and lay a flat stone in the bottom of the bell, holding it in place by stuffing some crumpled
paper in on top of it. Will the cylinder tip over now? Take the stone out, put the crumpled
paper in the bottom of the cylinder, put the stone on top of the paper, and again try to tip
the cylinder over. Will it fall?

       *       *       *       *       *

The center of the cylinder was always in one place, of course. But the center of the weight
in that cylinder was usually near the bottom, because the bell weighed so much more than the
paper. When you raised the center of weight by putting the stone up high or filling the cylinder
with crumpled paper, just a little tipping moved the center of weight so that it was not directly
over the bell on which the cylinder was resting. Whenever the center of weight is not over
the base of support (the bottom on which the thing is standing), an object will topple over.
Moving the center of weight up (Figs. 15 and 16) makes an object less stable.

The two main points to remember about stability are these: the wider the base of an object,
the harder it is to tip over; and the lower the center of the weight is, the harder it is to
tip over.

If you were out in a rowboat in a storm, would it be better to sit up straight in the seat
or to lie in the bottom of the boat?

Why is a flat-bottomed boat safer than a canoe?

Where do you suppose the center of weight of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is,--near the bottom
or near the top?

    APPLICATION 8. If you had a large flower to put into a vase
    and you did not want it to tip over easily, which of the three
    vases shown in Figure 18 would you choose?

    APPLICATION 9. Some boys made themselves a little sail-boat
    and went sailing in it. A storm came up. The boat rocked badly
    and was in danger of tipping over. "Throw out all the heavy
    things, quick!" shouted one. "No, no, don't for the life of
    you do it!" called another. "Chop down the mast--here, give me
    the hatchet!" another one said. "Crouch way down--lie on the
    bottom." "No, keep moving over to the side that is tipped up!"
    "Hold the things in the bottom of the boat still, so they'll
    not keep rolling from side to side." "Jump out and swim!"
    Every one was shouting at once. Which parts of the advice
    should you have followed if you had been on board?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    21. A ship when it goes to sea always carries ballast (weight)
    in its bottom.

    22. If the ship springs a leak below the water line, the water
    rushes in.

    23. The ship's pumps suck the water up out of the bottom of
    the ship.

    24. The water pours back into the sea from the mouths of the
    pumps.

    25. As the sailors move back and forth on the ship during a
    storm, they walk with their legs spread far apart.

    26. Although the ship tips far from side to side, it rights
    itself.

    27. However far the ship tips, the surface of the water in the
    bottom stays almost horizontal.

    28. While the ship is in danger, the people put on life
    preservers, which are filled with cork.

    29. When the ship rocks violently, people who are standing up
    are thrown to the floor, but those who are sitting down do not
    fall over.

    30. If the ship fills with water faster than the engines can
    pump it out, the ship sinks.

CHAPTER TWO

MOLECULAR ATTRACTION

SECTION 6. How liquids are absorbed: Capillary attraction.

    Why do blotters pull water into themselves when a flat piece
    of glass will not?

    How does a towel dry your face?

Suppose you could turn off nature's laws in the way that you can turn off electric lights.
And suppose you stood in front of a switchboard with each switch labeled with the name of the
law it would shut off. Of course, there is no such switchboard, but we know pretty well what
would happen if we could shut off various laws. One of the least dangerous-looking switches
would be one labeled CAPILLARY ATTRACTION. And now, just for fun, suppose that you have turned
that switch off in order to see the effect.

At first you do not notice any change; but after a while you begin to feel perspiration collecting
all over your body as if your clothes were made of rubber sheeting. Soon this becomes so uncomfortable
that you decide to take a bath. But when you put your wash cloth into the water you find that
it will not absorb any water at all; it gets a little wet on the outside, but remains stiff
and is not easy or pleasant to use. You reach for a sponge or a bath brush, but you are no
better off. Only the outside of the sponge and brush becomes wet, and they remain for the most
part harsh and dry.

Then perhaps you try to dry yourself with a towel. But that does not work; not a drop of water
will the towel absorb. You might as well try to dry yourself on the glossy side of a piece
of oilcloth.

By this time you are shivering; so you probably decide to light the oil stove and get warm
and dry over that. But the oil will not come up the wick! As a last resort you throw a dressing
gown around you (it does not get wet) and start a fire in the fireplace. This at last warms
and dries you; but as soon as you are dressed the clammy feeling comes again--your clothes
will not absorb any perspiration. While the capillary attraction switch is turned off you will
simply have to get used to this.

Then suppose you start to write your experience. Your fountain pen will not work. Even an ordinary
pen does not work as well as it ought to. It makes a blot on your paper. If you use the blotter
you are dismayed to find that the blot spreads out as flat as if you were pressing a piece
of glass against it. You take your eraser and try to remove the blot. To your delight you find
that it rubs out as easily as a pencil mark. The ink has not soaked into the paper at all.
You begin to see some of the advantages in shutting off capillary attraction.

Perhaps you are writing at the dining-room table, and you overturn the inkwell on the tablecloth.
Never mind, it is no trouble to brush the ink off. Not a sign of stain is left behind.

By and by you look outdoors at the garden. Everything is withering. The moisture does not move
through the earth to where the roots of the plants can reach it. Before everything withers
completely, you rush to the switchboard and turn on the capillary attraction again.

You can understand this force of capillary attraction better if you perform the following experiments:

    EXPERIMENT 13. Fill a glass with water and color it with a
    little blueing or red ink. Into the glass put two or three
    glass tubes, open at both ends, and with bores of different
    sizes. (One of these tubes should be so-called thermometer
    tubing, with about 1 mm. bore.) Watch the colored water and
    see in which of the tubes it is pulled highest.

    EXPERIMENT 14. Put a clean washed lamp wick into the glass of
    colored water and watch to see if the water is pulled up the
    wick. Now let the upper end of the wick hang over the side of
    the glass all night. Put an empty glass under the end that is
    hanging out. The next morning see what has happened.

The space between the threads of the wick, and especially the still finer spaces between the
fibers that make up the threads, act like fine tubes and the liquid rises in them just as it
did in the fine glass tube. Wherever there are fine spaces between the particles of anything,
as there are in a lump of sugar, a towel, a blotter, a wick, and hundreds of other things,
these spaces act like fine tubes and the liquid goes into them. The force that causes the liquid
to move along fine tubes or openings is called capillary attraction.

Capillary attraction--this tendency of liquids to go into fine tubes--is caused by the same
force that makes things cling to each other (adhesion), and that makes things hold together
(cohesion). The next two sections tell about these two forces; so you will understand the cause
of capillary attraction more thoroughly after reading them. But you should know capillary attraction
when you see it now, and know how to use it. The following questions will show whether or not
you do:

    APPLICATION 10. Suppose you have spilled some milk on a
    carpet, and that you have at hand wet tea leaves, dry corn
    meal, some torn bits of a glossy magazine cover, and a piece
    of new cloth the pores of which are stopped up with starch.
    Which would be the best to use in taking up the milk?

    APPLICATION 11. A boy spattered some candle grease on his
    coat. His aunt told him to lay a blotter on the candle grease
    and to press a hot iron on the blotter, or to put the blotter
    under his coat and the iron on top of the candle grease,--he
    was not quite sure which. While he was trying to recall his
    aunt's directions, his sister said that he could use soap and
    water to take the grease out; then his brother told him to
    scrape the spot with a knife. Which would have been the right
    thing for him to do?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    31. A pen has a slit running down to the point.

    32. When a man smokes, the smoke goes from the cigar into his
    mouth.

    33. A blotter which has one end in water soon becomes wet all
    over.

    34. Cream comes to the top of milk.

    35. It is much harder to stand on stilts than on your feet.

    36. Oiled shoes are almost waterproof.

    37. City water reservoirs are located on the highest possible
    places in or near cities.

    38. You can fill a self-filling fountain pen by squeezing the
    bulb, then letting go.

    39. The oceans do not flow off the world.

    40. When you turn a bottle of water upside down the water
    gurgles out instead of coming out in a smooth, steady stream.

SECTION 7. How things stick to one another: Adhesion.

    Why is it that when a thing is broken it will not stay
    together without glue?

    Why does chalk stay on the blackboard?

Now that you have found out something about capillary attraction, suppose that you should go
to the imaginary switchboard again and tamper with some other law of nature. An innocent-looking
switch, right above the capillary attraction switch, would be labeled ADHESION. Suppose you
have turned it off:

In an instant the wall paper slips down from the walls and crumples to a heap on the floor.
The paint and varnish drop from the woodwork like so much sand. Every cobweb and speck of dust
rolls off and falls in a little black heap below.

When you try to wash, you cannot wet your hands. But they do not need washing, as the dirt
tumbles off, leaving them cleaner than they ever were before. You can jump into a tank of water
with all your clothes on and come out as dry as you went in. You discover by the dryness of
your clothes that capillary attraction stopped when the adhesion was turned off, for capillary
attraction is just a part of adhesion. But you are not troubled now with the clamminess of
unabsorbed perspiration. The perspiration rolls off in little drops, not wetting anything but
running to the ground like so much quicksilver.

Your hair is fluffier than after the most vigorous shampoo. Your skin smarts with dryness.
Your eyes are almost blinded by their lack of tears. Even when you cry, the tears roll from
your eyeballs and eyelids like water from a duck's back. Your mouth is too dry to talk; all
the saliva rolls down your throat, leaving your tongue and cheeks as dry as cornstarch.

I think you would soon turn on the adhesion switch again.

    EXPERIMENT 15. Touch the surface of a glass of water, and then
    raise your finger slightly. Notice whether the water tends to
    follow or to keep away from your finger as you raise it. Now
    dip your whole finger into the water and draw it out. Notice
    how the water clings, and watch the drops form and fall off.
    Notice the film of water that stays on, wetting your finger,
    after all dropping stops.

Which do you think is the stronger, the pull of gravity which makes some of the water drip
off, or the pull of adhesion which makes some of the water cling to your finger?

If the pull of gravity is stronger, would not all the water drop off, leaving your finger dry?
If the pull of adhesion is the stronger, would not all the water stay on your finger, none
dropping off?

The truth of the matter is that gravity is stronger than adhesion unless things are very close
together; then adhesion is stronger. The part of the water that is very close to your finger
clings to it in spite of gravity; the part that is farther away forms drops and falls down
because of the pull of gravity.

Adhesion, then, is the force that makes things cling to each other when they are very close
together.

WHY IT IS EASIER TO TURN A PAGE IF YOU WET YOUR FINGER. Water spreads out on things so that
it gets very close to them. The thin film of water on your finger is close enough to your finger
and to the page which you are turning to cling to both; so when you move your finger, the page
moves along with it.

WHY DUST CLINGS TO THE CEILING AND WALLS. The fine particles of dust are wafted up against
the ceiling and walls by the moving air in the room. They are so small that they can fit into
the small dents that are in plaster and paper and can get very close to the wall. Once they
get close enough, the force of adhesion holds them with a pull stronger than that of gravity.

Oily and wet surfaces catch dust much more readily than clean, dry ones, simply because the
dust can get so much closer to the oil or water film and because this film flows partly around
each dust particle and holds it by the force of adhesion. This is why your face gets much dirtier
when it is perspiring than when it is dry.

    APPLICATION 12. Explain why cobwebs do not fall from the
    ceiling; why dust clings to a wet broom; why a postage stamp
    does not fall off an envelope.

SECTION 8. The force that makes a thing hold together: Cohesion.

    What makes rain fall in drops?

    Why are diamonds hard?

You have not yet touched any of the most dangerous switches on the imaginary switchboard of
universal laws. But if your experience in turning off the capillary attraction and adhesion
switches did not discourage you, you might try turning off the one beside them labeled COHESION:

Things happen too swiftly for you to know much about them. The house you are in falls to dust
instantly. You fall through the place where the floor has been; but you do not bump on the
cement basement floor below, partly because there is no such thing as a hard floor or even
hard ground anywhere, and partly because you disintegrate--fall to pieces--so completely that
there is nothing left of you but a grayish film of fine dust and a haze of warm water.

With a deafening roar, rocks, skyscrapers, and even mountains tumble down, fall to pieces,
and sink into an inconceivably fine dust. Nothing stands up in the world--not a tree, not an
animal, not an island. With a wild rush the oceans flood in over the dust that has been nations
and continents, and then this dust turns to a fine muddy ooze in the bottom of a worldwide sea.

But it is an ocean utterly different from what we have in the real world. There are no waves.
Neither are there any reflections of clouds in its surface,--first because the clouds would
fly to pieces and turn to invisible vapor, and second, because the ocean has no surface--it
simply melts away into the air and no one can tell where the water stops and where the air begins.

Then the earth grows larger and larger. The ocean turns to a heavy, dense, transparent steam.
The fine mud that used to be rocks and mountains and living things turns to a heavy, dense gas.

Our once beautiful, solid, warm, living earth now whirls on through space, a swollen, gaseous
globe, utterly dead.

And the only thing that prevents all this from actually happening right now is that there is
a force called cohesion that holds things together. It is the pull which one particle of anything
has on another particle of the same material. The paper in this book, the chair on which you
are sitting, and you yourself are all made of a vast number of unthinkably small particles
called molecules, each of which is pulling on its neighbor with such force that all stay in
their places. Substances in which they pull the hardest, like steel, are very hard to break
in two; that is, it is difficult to pull the molecules of these substances apart. In liquids,
such as water, the molecules do not pull nearly so hard on each other. In a gas, such as air,
they are so far apart that they have practically no pull on each other at all. That is why
everything would turn to a gas if the force of cohesion stopped. Why things would turn cold
will be explained in Chapter 4.

SECTION 9. Friction.

    What makes ice slippery?

    How does a brake stop a car?

    Why do things wear out?

It would not be such a calamity if we were to turn off friction from the world. Still, I doubt
whether we should want to leave it off much longer than was necessary for us to see what would
happen. Suppose we imagine the world with all friction removed:

A man on a bicycle can coast forever along level ground. Ships at sea can shut off steam and
coast clear across the ocean. No machinery needs oiling. The clothes on your body feel smoother
and softer than the finest silk. Perpetual motion is an established fact instead of an absolute
impossibility; everything that is not going against gravity will keep right on moving forever
or until it bumps into something else.

But, if there is no friction and you want to stop, you cannot. Suppose you are in an automobile
when all friction stops. You speed along helplessly in the direction you are going. You cannot
steer the machine--your hands would slip right around on the steering wheel, and even if you
turn it by grasping the spoke, your machine still skids straight forward. If you start to go
up a hill, you slow down, stop, and then before you can get out of the machine you start backward
down the hill again and keep on going backward until you smash into something.

A person on foot does not fare much better. If he is walking at the time friction ceases, the
ground is suddenly so slippery that he falls down and slides along on his back or stomach in
the same direction he was walking, until he bumps into something big or starts to slip up a
slope. If he reaches a slope, he, like the automobile, stops an instant a little way up, then
starts sliding helplessly backward.

Another man is standing still when the friction is turned off. He cannot get anywhere. As soon
as he starts to walk forward, his feet slip out from under him and he falls on his face. He
lies in the same spot no matter how he wriggles and squirms. If he tries to push with his hands,
they slip over the rough ground more easily than they now slip through air. He cannot push
sideways enough even to turn over. If there happens to be a rope within reach and one end is
tied to a tree, he might try to take hold of the rope to pull himself along. But no matter
how tightly he squeezes, the rope slips right through his hands when he starts to pull. If,
however, there is a loop in the rope, he can slip his hand through the loop and try to pull.
But the knots with which the rope is tied immediately come untied and he is as helpless as ever.

Even if he takes hold of a board fence he is no more successful. The nails in the board slip
out of their holes and he is left with a perfectly slippery and useless board on the ground
beside him for a companion. As it grows cold toward evening he may take some matches out of
his pocket and try to start a fire. Aside from the difficulty of his being unable to hold them
except by the most careful balancing or by shutting them up within his slippery hands, he is
entirely incapable of lighting them; they slip over the cement beneath him or over the sole
of his shoe without the least rubbing.

In the real world, however, it is fortunately as impossible to get away from friction as it
is to get away from the other laws we have tried to imagine as being turned off. There is always
some friction, or rubbing, whenever anything moves. A bird rubs against the air, the point
of a spinning top rubs against the sidewalk on which it is spinning. Your shoes rub against
the ground as you walk and so make it possible for you to push yourself forward. The drive
wheels of machinery rub against the belts and pull them along. There is friction between the
wheels of a car and the track they are pushing against, or the wheels would whirl around and
around uselessly.

But we can increase or decrease friction a great deal. If we make things rough, there is more
friction between them than if they are smooth. If we press things tightly together, there is
more friction than if they touch lightly. A nail in a loose hole comes out easily, but in a
tight hole it sticks; the pressure has increased the friction. A motorman in starting a trolley
car sometimes finds the track so smooth that the wheels whirl around without pushing the car
forward; he pours some sand on the track to make it rougher, and the car starts. When you put
on new shoes, they are so smooth on the bottom that they slip over the ground because of the
lack of friction. If you scratch the soles, they are rougher and you no longer slip. If you
try to pull a stake out of the ground, you have to squeeze it harder than the ground does or
it will slip out of your hands instead of slipping out of the ground. When you apply a brake
to an automobile, the brake must press tightly against the axle or wheel to cause enough friction
to stop the automobile.

There are always two results of friction: heat and wear. Sometimes these effects of friction
are helpful to us, and sometimes they are quite the opposite. The heat from friction is helpful
when it makes it possible for us to light a fire, but it is far from helpful when it causes
a hot box because of an ungreased wheel on a train or wagon, or burns your hands when you slide
down a rope. The wear from friction is helpful when it makes it possible to sandpaper a table,
scour a pan, scrub a floor, or erase a pencil mark; but we don't like it when it wears out
automobile tires, all the parts of machinery, and our clothes.

    EXPERIMENT 17. Hold a nail against a grindstone while you turn
    the stone. Notice both the wear and heat. Let the nail rest
    lightly on the stone part of the time and press hard part of
    the time. Which way does the nail get hotter? Which way does
    it wear off more quickly? Run it over a pane of glass and see
    if it gets as hot as it does on the grindstone; if it wears
    down as quickly.

WHY WE OIL MACHINERY. We can decrease friction by keeping objects from pressing tightly against
each other, and by making their surfaces smooth. The most common way of making surfaces smooth
is by oiling or greasing them. A film of oil or grease makes things so smooth and slippery
that there is very little friction. That is why all kinds of machinery will run so smoothly
if they are kept oiled. And since the oil decreases friction, it decreases the wear caused
by friction. So well-oiled machines last much longer than machines that are not sufficiently oiled.

WHY BALL BEARINGS ARE USED. There is much less friction when a round object rolls over a surface
than when two surfaces slide over one another, unless the sliding surfaces are very smooth;
think how much easier it is to pull a wagon forward than it would be to take hold of the wheels
and pull the wagon sidewise. So when you want the least possible friction in a machine you
use ball bearings. The bearings are located in the hub of a wheel. Then, instead of the axle
rubbing against the hub, the bearings roll inside of the hub. This causes very little friction;
and the friction is made still less by keeping the bearings oiled.

    APPLICATION 14. Suppose you were making a bicycle,--in
    which of the following places would you want to increase the
    friction, and in which would you want to decrease it? Handle
    grips, axles, pedals, tires, pedal cranks, the sockets in
    which the handle bar turns, the nuts that hold the parts
    together.

    APPLICATION 15. A small boy decided to surprise his mother
    by oiling her sewing-machine. He put oil in the following
    places:

    On the treadle, on the large wheel over which the belt runs,
    on the axle of the same wheel, on the groove in the little
    wheel up above where the belt runs, on the joint where the
    needle runs up and down, on the little rough place under the
    needle that pushes the cloth forward. Which of these did he do
    well to oil and which should he have let alone?

CHAPTER THREE

CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

SECTION 10. Levers.

How a big weight can be lifted with a little force; how one thing moving slowly a short distance
can make another move swiftly a long distance.

    Why can you go so much faster on a bicycle than on foot?

    How can a man lift up a heavy automobile by using a jack?

    Why can you crack a hard nut with a nutcracker when you cannot
    crack it by squeezing it between two pieces of iron?

"Give me a lever, long enough and strong enough, and something to rest it on, and I can lift
the whole world," said an old Greek philosopher. And as a philosopher he was right; theoretically
it would be possible. But since he needed a lever that would have been as long as from here
to the farthest star whose distance has ever been measured, and since he would have had to
push his end of the lever something like a quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) miles to
lift the earth one inch, his proposition was hardly a practical one.

But levers are practical. Without them there would be none of our modern machines. No locomotives
could speed across the continents; no derricks could lift great weights; no automobiles or
bicycles would quicken our travel; our very bodies would be completely paralyzed. Yet the law
back of all these things is really simple.

You have often noticed on the see-saw that a small child at one end can be balanced by a larger
child at the other end, provided that the larger child sits nearer the middle. Why should it
matter where the larger child sits? He is always heavier--why doesn't he overbalance the small
child? It is because when the small child moves up and down he goes a longer distance than
the large child does. In Figure 26 the large boy moves up and down only half as far as the
little girl does. She weighs only half as much as he, yet she balances him.

You will begin to get a general understanding of levers and how they work by doing the following
experiment:

    EXPERIMENT 18. For this experiment there will be needed a
    small pail filled with something heavy (sand or stones will
    do), a yardstick with a hole through the middle and another
    hole near one end and with notches cut here and there along
    the edge, and a post or table corner with a heavy nail driven
    into it to within an inch of the head. The holes in the
    yardstick must be large enough to let the head of this nail
    through.

    Put the middle hole of the yardstick over the nail, as is
    shown in Figure 27. The nail is the fulcrum of your lever.
    Now hang the pail on one of the notches about halfway between
    the fulcrum and the end of the stick and put your hand on the
    opposite side of the yardstick at about the same distance as
    the pail is from the fulcrum. Raise and lower the pail several
    times by moving the opposite end of the lever up and down. See
    how much force it takes to move the pail.

    Now slide your hand toward the fulcrum and lower and raise the
    pail from that position. Is it harder or easier to lift the
    pail from here than from the first position? Which moves
    farther up and down, your hand or the pail?

    Next, slide your hand all the way out to the end of the
    yardstick and raise and lower the pail from there. Is the pail
    harder or easier to lift? Does the pail move a longer or a
    shorter distance up and down than your hand?

    If you wanted to move the pail a long way without moving your
    hand as far, would you put your hand nearer to the fulcrum or
    farther from it than the pail is?

    Suppose you wanted to lift the pail with the least possible
    effort, where would you put your hand?

    Notice another fact: when your hand is at the end of the
    yardstick, it takes the same length of time to move a long way
    as the pail takes to move a short way. Then which is moving
    faster, your hand or the pail?

    EXPERIMENT 19. Put the end hole of the yardstick on the nail,
    as shown in Figure 28. The nail is still the fulcrum of your
    lever. Put the pail about halfway between the fulcrum and the
    other end of the stick, and hold the end of the stick in your
    hands.

    Raise and lower your hand to see how hard or how easy it is
    to lift the pail from this position. Which is moving farther,
    your hand or the pail? Which is moving faster?

    Now put your hand about halfway between the fulcrum and the
    pail and raise and lower it. Is it harder or easier to raise
    than before? Which moves farther this time, your hand or the
    pail? Which moves faster?

    If you wanted to make the pail move farther and faster than
    your hand, would you put your hand nearer to the fulcrum than
    the pail is, or farther from the fulcrum than the pail? If you
    wanted to move the pail with the least effort, where would you
    put your hand?

    EXPERIMENT 20. Use a pair of long-bladed shears and fold a
    piece of cardboard once to lie astride your own or some one
    else's finger. Put the finger, protected by the cardboard,
    between the two points of the shears. Then squeeze the handles
    of the shears together. See if you can bring the handles
    together hard enough to hurt the finger between the points.

    Now watch the shears as you open and close the blades. Which
    move farther, the points of the shears or the handles? Which
    move faster?

    Next, put the finger, still protected by the cardboard,
    between the handles of the shears and press the points
    together. Can you pinch the finger this way harder or less
    hard than in the way you first tried?

    Do the points or handles move farther as you close the shears?
    Which part closes with the greater force?

    EXPERIMENT 21. Use a Dover egg beater. Fasten a small piece
    of string to one of the blades, so that you can tell how many
    times it goes around. Turn the handle of the beater around
    once slowly and count how many times the blade goes around.
    Which moves faster, the handle or the blade? Where would you
    expect to find more force, in the cogs or in the blades? Test
    your conclusion this way: Put your finger between the blades
    and try to pinch it by turning the handle; then place your
    finger so that the skin is caught between the cogs and try to
    pinch the finger by turning the blades. Where is there more
    force? Where is there more motion?

    EXPERIMENT 22. Put a spool over the nail which was your
    fulcrum in the first two experiments. (Take the stick off
    the nail first, of course.) Use this spool as a pulley. Put a
    string over it and fasten one end of your string to the pail
    (Fig. 32). Lift the pail by pulling down on the other end of
    the string. Notice that it is not harder or easier to move the
    pail when it is near the nail than when it is near the floor.
    When your hand moves down from the nail to the floor, how far
    up does the pail move? Does the pail move a greater or less
    distance than your hand, or does it move the same distance?

    Next fasten one end of the string to the nail. Set the pail on
    the floor. Pass the string through the handle of the pail and
    up over the spool (Fig. 33). Pull down on the loose end of the
    string. Is the pail easier to lift in this way or in the
    way you first tried? As you pull down with your hand, notice
    whether your hand moves farther than the pail, not so far
    as the pail, or the same distance. Is the greater amount
    of motion in your hand or in the pail? Then where would you
    expect the greater amount of force?

The whole idea of the lever can be summed up like this: one end of the contrivance moves more
than the other. But energy cannot be lost; so to make up for this extra motion at one end more
force is always exerted at the other.

This rule is true for all kinds of levers, blocks and tackles or pulley systems, automobile
and bicycle gears, belt systems, cog systems, derricks, crowbars, and every kind of machine.
In most machines you either put in more force than you get out and gain motion, or you put
in more motion than you get out and gain force. In the following examples of the lever see
if you can tell whether you are applying more force and obtaining more motion, or whether you
are putting in more motion and obtaining more force:

Cracking nuts with a nut cracker.

Beating eggs with a Dover egg beater.

Going up a hill in an automobile on low gear.

Speeding on high gear.

Cutting cloth with the points of shears.

Cutting near the angle of the shears.

Turning a door knob.

Picking up sugar with sugar tongs.

Pinching your finger in the crack of a door on the hinge side.

    APPLICATION 16. Suppose you wanted to lift a heavy frying
    pan off the stove. You have a cloth to keep it from burning
    your hand. Would it be easier to lift it by the end of the
    handle or by the part of the handle nearest the pan?

    APPLICATION 17. A boy was going to wheel his little sister
    in a wheelbarrow. She wanted to sit in the middle of the
    wheelbarrow; her brother thought she should sit as near the
    handles as possible so that she would be nearer his hands.
    Another boy thought she should sit as near the wheel as
    possible. Who was right?

    APPLICATION 18. James McDougal lived in a hilly place. He
    was going to buy a bicycle. "I want one that will take the
    hills easily," he said. The dealer showed him two bicycles.
    On one the back wheel went around three times while the pedals
    went around once; on the other the back wheel went around
    four and a half times while the pedals went around once. Which
    bicycle should James have chosen? If he had wanted the bicycle
    for racing, which should he have chosen?

    APPLICATION 19. A wagon stuck in the mud. The driver got out
    and tried to help the horse by grasping the spokes and turning
    the wheel. Should he have grasped the spokes near the hub,
    near the rim, or in the middle?

SECTION 11. Inertia.

    Why is it that if you push a miniature auto rapidly, it will
    go straight?

    Why does the earth never stop moving?

    When you jerk a piece of paper from under an inkwell, why does
    the inkwell stay still?

When you are riding in a car and the car stops suddenly, you are thrown forward; your body
tends to keep moving in the direction in which the car was going. When a car starts suddenly,
you are thrown backward; your body tends to stay where it was before the car started.

When an automobile bumps into anything, the people in the front seat are often thrown forward
through the wind shield and are badly cut; their bodies keep on going in the direction in which
the automobile was going.

When you jump off a moving street car, you have to run along in the direction the car was going
or you fall down; your body tries to keep going in the same direction it was moving, and if
your feet do not keep up, you topple forward.

Generally we think that it takes force to start things to move, but that they will stop of
their own accord. This is not true. It takes just as much force to stop a thing as it does
to start it, and what usually does the stopping is friction.

When you shoot a stone in a sling shot, the contracting rubber pulls the stone forward very
rapidly. The stone has been started and it would go on and never stop if nothing interfered
with it. For instance, if you should go away off in space--say halfway between here and a star--and
shoot a stone from a sling shot, that stone would keep on going as fast as it was going when
it left your sling shot, forever and ever, without stopping, unless it bumped into a star or
something. On earth the reason it stops after a while is that it is bumping into something
all the time--into the particles of air while it is in the air, and finally against the earth
when it is pulled to the ground by gravity.

If you threw a ball on the moon, the person who caught it would have to have a very thick mitt
to protect his hand, and it would never be safe to catch a batted fly. For there is no air
on the moon, and therefore nothing would slow the ball down until it hit something; and it
would be going as hard and fast when it struck the hand of the one who caught it as when it
left your hand or the bat.

TRY THESE EXPERIMENTS:

    EXPERIMENT 23. Fill a glass almost to the brim with water.
    Lay a smooth piece of writing paper 10 or 11 inches long on a
    smooth table, placing it near the edge of the table. Set the
    glass of water on the paper near its inner edge (Fig. 34).

    Take hold of the edge of the paper that is near the edge of
    the table. Move your hand a little toward the glass so that
    the paper is somewhat bent. Then, keeping your hand near the
    level of the table, suddenly jerk the paper out from under the
    glass. If you give a quick enough jerk and keep your hand near
    the level of the table, not a drop of water will spill and the
    glass will stay almost exactly where it was.

This is because the glass of water has inertia. It was standing still, and so it tends to remain
standing still. Your jerk was so sudden that there was not time to overcome the inertia of
the glass of water; so it stayed where it was.

    EXPERIMENT 24. Have a boy on roller skates skate down the hall
    or sidewalk toward you and have him begin to coast as he comes
    near. When he reaches you, put out your arm and try to stop
    him. Notice how much force it takes to stop him in spite of
    the fact that he is no longer pushing himself along.

    Now let the boy skate toward you again, coasting as before;
    but this time have him swing himself around a corner by taking
    hold of you as he passes. Notice how much force it takes just
    to change the direction in which he is moving.

SECTION 12. Centrifugal force.

    Why does not the moon fall down to the earth?

    Why will a lasso go so far after it is whirled?

    Why does a top stand on its point while it is spinning?

If centrifugal force suddenly stopped acting, you would at first not notice any change. But
if you happened to get into an automobile and rode down a muddy street, you would be delighted
to find that the mud did not fly up from the wheels as you sped along. And when you went around
a slippery corner, your automobile would not skid in the least.

If a dog came out of a pool of water and shook himself while centrifugal force was not acting,
the water, instead of flying off in every direction, would merely drip down to the ground as
if the dog were not shaking himself at all. A cowboy would find that he could no longer throw
his lasso by whirling it around his head. A boy trying to spin his top would discover that
the top would not stand on its point while spinning, any better than when it was not spinning.

These are little things, however. Most people would be quite unconscious of any change for
some time. Then, as night came on and the full moon rose, it would look as if it were growing
larger and larger. It would seem slowly to swell and swell until it filled the whole sky. Then
with a stupendous crash the moon would collide with the earth. Every one would be instantly
killed. And it would be lucky for them that they were; for if any people survived the shock
of the awful collision, they would be roasted to death by the heat produced by the striking
together of the earth and the moon. Moreover, the earth would be whirled swiftly toward the
sun, and a little later the charred earth would be swept into the sun's vast, tempestuous flames.

When we were talking about inertia, we said that if there were no inertia, the moon would tumble
down to the earth and the earth, too, would fall into the sun. That was because if there were
no inertia there would be no centrifugal force. For centrifugal force is not really a force
at all, but it is one form of inertia--the inertia of whirling things. Do this experiment:

    EXPERIMENT 25. Hold a pail half full of water in one hand.
    Swing it back and forth a couple of times; then swing it
    swiftly forward, up, and on around, bringing it down back of
    you (Fig. 36). Swing it around this way swiftly and evenly
    several times, finally stopping at the beginning of the up
    swing.

It is centrifugal force that keeps the water in the pail. It depends entirely on inertia. You
see, while the pail is swinging upward rapidly, the water is moving up and tends by its inertia
to keep right on moving in the same upward direction. Before you get it over your head, the
tendency of the water to keep on going up is so strong that it pulls on your arm and hand and
presses against the bottom of the pail above it. Its tendency to go on up is stronger than
the downward pull of gravity. As you swing the pail on backward, the water of course has to
move backward, too; so now it tends to keep on moving backward; and when the pail is starting
down behind you, the water is tending to fly out in the backward direction in which it has
just been going. Therefore it still pushes against the bottom of the pail and pulls away from
your shoulder, which is in the center of the circle about which the pail is moving. By the
time you have swung the pail on down, the water in it tends to keep going down, and it is still
pulling away from your shoulder and pressing against the bottom of the pail.

In this way, during every instant the water tends to keep going in the direction in which it
was going just the instant before. The result is that the water keeps pulling away from your
shoulder as long as you keep swinging it around.

All whirling things tend to fly away from the center about which they are turning. This is
the law of centrifugal force. The earth, for example, as it swings around the sun, tends to
fly away from the center of its orbit. This tendency of the earth--its centrifugal force--keeps
it from being drawn into the sun by the powerful pull of the sun's gravitation. At the same
time it is this gravitation of the sun that keeps the earth from flying off into space, where
we should all be frozen to icicles and lost in everlasting night. For if the sun's pull stopped,
the earth would fly off as does a stone whirled from the end of a string, when you let go of
the string.

The moon, in like manner, would fly away from the earth and sun if gravitation stopped pulling
it, but it would crash into us if its centrifugal force did not keep it at a safe distance.

Have you ever sat on a spinning platform, sometimes called "the social whirl," in an amusement
park, and tried to stay on as it spun faster and faster? It is centrifugal force that makes
you slide away from the center and off at the edge.

HOW CREAM IS SEPARATED FROM MILK BY CENTRIFUGAL FORCE. The heavier things are, the harder they
are thrown out by centrifugal force. Milk is heavier than cream, as you know from the fact
that cream rises and floats on top of the milk. So when milk is put into a centrifugal separator,
a machine that whirls it around very rapidly, the milk is thrown to the outside harder than
the cream, and the cream therefore stays nearer the middle. As the bowl of the machine whirls
faster, the milk is thrown so hard against the outside that it flattens out and rises up the
sides of the bowl. Thus you have a large hollow cylinder of milk on the outside against the
wall of the bowl, while the whirling cream forms a smaller cylinder inside the cylinder of
milk. By putting a spout on the machine so that it reaches the inner cylinder, the cream can
be drawn off, while a spout not put in so far will draw off the milk.

WHY A SPINNING TOP STANDS ON ITS POINT. When a top spins, all the particles of wood of which
the top is made are thrown out and away from the center of the top, or rather they tend to
go out and away. And the pull of these particles out from the center is stronger than the pull
of gravitation on the edges of the top to make it tip over; so it stands upright while it spins.
Spin a top and see how this is.

    APPLICATION 21. Explain how a motor cyclist can ride on an
    almost perpendicular wall in a circular race track. Explain
    how the earth keeps away from the sun, which is always
    powerfully pulling the earth toward it.

    Explain the following:

    91. As you tighten a screw it becomes harder to turn.

    92. There is a process for partly drying food by whirling it
    rapidly in a perforated cylinder.

    93. It is easier to climb mountains in hobnailed shoes than in

    he rides along a wet street.

    100. A typewriter key goes down less than an inch, yet the
    type bar goes up nearly 5 inches.

SECTION 13. Action and reaction.

    How can a bird fly? What makes it stay up in the air?

    What makes a gun kick?

    Why do you sink when you stop swimming?

Whenever anything moves, it pushes something else in an opposite direction. When you row a
boat you can notice this; you see the oars pushing the water backward to push the boat forward.
Also, when you shoot a bullet forward you can feel the gun kick backward; or when you pull
down hard enough on a bar, your body rises up and you chin yourself. But the law is just as
true for things which are not noticeable. When you walk, your feet push back against the earth;
and if the earth were not so enormous and you so small, and if no one else were pushing in
the opposite direction, you would see the earth spin back a little for each step you took forward,
just as the big ball that a performing bear stands on turns backward as the bear tries to walk
forward.

The usual way of saying this is, "Action and reaction are equal and opposite." If you climb
a rope, the upward movement of your body is the action; but you have to pull down on the rope
to lift your body up. This is the reaction.

Without this law of action and reaction no fish could swim, no steamboat could push its way
across the water, no bird could fly, no train or machine of any kind could move forward or
backward, no man or animal could walk or crawl. The whole world of living things would be utterly
paralyzed.

When anything starts to move, it does so by pushing on something else. When your arms start
to move up, they do so by pushing your body down a little. When you swim, you push the water
back and down with your arms and legs, and this pushes your body forward and up. When a bird
flies up into the air, it pushes its body up by beating the air down with its wings. When an
airplane whirs along, its propeller fans the air backward all the time. Street-car tracks are
kept shiny by the wheels, which slip a little as they tend to shove the track backward in making
the car move forward. Automobile tires wear out in much the same way,--they slip and are worn
by friction as they move the earth back in pushing the automobile forward. In fact, if there
are loose pebbles or mud on the road, you can see the pebbles or mud fly back, as the wheels
of the automobile begin to turn rapidly and give their backward push to the earth beneath.

Here are a couple of experiments that will show you action and reaction more clearly:

    EXPERIMENT 26. Stand on a platform scale and weigh yourself.
    When the beam is exactly balanced, move your hands upward and
    notice whether you weigh more or less when they start up.
    Now move them downward; when they start down, do you weigh
    more or less? Toss a ball into the air, and watch your weight
    while you are tossing it. Does your body tend to go up or down
    while you are making the ball go up?

    EXPERIMENT 27. Go out into the yard and sit in a rope swing.
    Stop the swing entirely. Keep your feet off the ground all
    through the experiment. Now try to work yourself up in the
    swing; that is, make it swing by moving your legs and body and
    arms, but not by touching the ground. (Try to make it swing
    forward and backward only; when you try to swing sidewise, the
    distance between the ropes spoils the experiment.) See if you
    can figure out why the swing will not move back and forth.
    Notice your bodily motions; notice that when half of your body
    goes forward, half goes back; when you pull back with your
    hands, you push your body forward. If you watch yourself
    closely, you will see that every backward motion is exactly
    balanced by a forward motion of some part of your body.

    APPLICATION 22. Explain why you push forward against the
    table to shove your chair back from it; why a bird beats down
    with its wings against the air to force itself up; why you
    push back on the water with your oars to make a rowboat go
    forward.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    101. Water comes up city pipes into your kitchen.

    102. When you try to push a heavy trunk, your feet slip out
    from under you and slide in the opposite direction.

    103. When you turn a bottle of water upside down with a small
    piece of cardboard laid over its mouth, the water stays in the

    104. You can squeeze a thing very tightly in a vise.

    on a log floating in the water and roll the log around
    with their feet, each one trying to make the other lose his

    apparently runs forward.

    110. You cannot lift yourself by your own boot straps.

SECTION 14. Elasticity.

    What makes a ball bounce?

    How does a springboard help you dive?

    Why are automobile and bicycle tires filled with air?

Suppose there were a man who was perfectly elastic, and who made everything he touched perfectly
elastic. Fortunately there is no such person, but suppose an elastic man did exist:

He walks with a spring and a bound; his feet bounce up like rubber balls each time they strike
the earth; his legs snap back into place after each step as if pulled by a spring. If he stumbles
and falls to the ground, he bounces back up into the air without a scar. (You see, his skin
springs back into shape even if it is scratched, so that a scratch instantly heals.) And he
bounces on and on forever without stopping.

Suppose you, seeing his plight, try to stop him. Since we are pretending that he makes everything
he touches elastic, the instant you touch him you bounce helplessly away in the opposite direction.

You may think your clothes will be wrinkled by all this bouncing about, but since we are imagining
that you have caught the elastic touch from the elastic man, your clothes which touch you likewise
become perfectly elastic. So no matter how mussed they get, they promptly straighten out again
to the condition they were in when you touched the elastic man.

If you notice that your shoe lace was untied just before you became elastic, and you now try
to tie it and tuck it in, you find it most unmanageable. It insists upon flying out of your
shoe and springing untied again.

Perhaps your hair was mussed before you became elastic. Now it is impossible to comb it straight;
each hair springs back like a fine steel wire.

If you take a handkerchief from your pocket to wipe your perspiring brow, you find that it
does not stay unfolded. As soon as it is spread out on your hand, it snaps back to the shape
and the folds it had while in your pocket.

Suppose you bounce up into an automobile for a ride. The automobile, now being made elastic
by your magic touch, bounds up into the air at the first bump it strikes, and thereafter it
goes hopping down the street in a most distressing manner, bouncing off the ground like a rubber
ball each time it comes down. And each time it bumps you are thrown off the seat into the air.

You find it hard to stay in any new position. Your body always tends to snap back to the position
you were in when you first became elastic. If you touch a trotting horse and it becomes elastic,
the poor animal finds that his legs always straighten out to their trotting position, whether
he wants to walk or stand still or lie down.

Imagine the plight of a boy pitching a ball, or some one yawning and stretching, or a clown
turning a somersault, if you touch each of these just in the act and make him elastic. Their
bodies always tend to snap back to these positions. Whenever the clown wants to rest, he has
to get in the somersault position. The boy pitcher sleeps in the position of "winding up" to
throw the ball. The one who was yawning and stretching has to be always on the alert, because
the instant he stops holding himself in some other position, his mouth flies open, his arms
fly out, and every one thinks he is bored to death.

You might touch the clay that a sculptor is molding and make it elastic. The sculptor can mold
all he pleases, but the clay is like rubber and always returns at once to its original shape.

If you make a tree elastic when a man is chopping it down, his ax bounces back from the tree
with such force as nearly to knock him over, and no amount of chopping makes so much as a lasting
dent in the tree.

Suppose you step in some mud. The mud does not stick to your shoes. It bends down under your
weight, but springs back to form again as soon as your weight is removed.

And if you try to spread some elastic butter on bread, nothing will make the butter stay spread.
The instant you remove your knife, the butter rolls up again into the same kind of lump it
was in before.

As for chewing your bread, you might as well try to chew a rubber band. You force your jaws
open, and they snap back on the bread all right; then they spring open again, and snap back
and keep this up automatically until you make them stop. But for all this vigorous chewing
your bread looks as if it had never been touched by a tooth.

Sewing is about as difficult. The thread springs into a coil in the shape of the spool. No
hem stays turned; the cloth you try to sew springs into its original folds in a most exasperating
manner.

On the whole, a perfectly elastic world would be a hopeless one to live in.

Elasticity is the tendency of a thing to go back to its original shape or size whenever it
is forced into a different shape or size.

A thing does not have to be soft to be elastic. Steel is very elastic; that is why good springs
are almost always made of steel. Glass is elastic; you know how you can bounce a glass marble.
Rubber is elastic, too. Air is elastic in a different way; it does not go back to its original
shape, since it has no shape, but if it has been compressed and the pressure is removed it
immediately expands again; so a football or any such thing filled with air is decidedly elastic.
That is why automobile and bicycle tires are filled with air; it makes the best possible "springs."

Balls bounce because they are elastic. When a ball strikes the ground, it is pushed out of
shape. Since it is elastic it tries immediately to come back to its former shape, and so pushes
out against the ground. This gives it such a push upward that it flies back to your hand.

Sometimes people confuse elasticity with action and reaction. But the differences between them
are very clear. Action and reaction happen at the same time; your body goes up at the same
time that you pull down on a bar to chin yourself; while in elasticity a thing moves first
one way, then the other; you throw a ball down, then it comes back up to you. Another difference
is that in action and reaction one thing moves one way and another thing is pushed the other
way; while in elasticity the same thing moves first one way, then the other. If you press down
on a spring scale with your hand, you are lifting up your body a little to do it; that is action
and reaction. But after you take your hand off the scale the pan springs back up: first it
was pushed down, then it springs back to its original position; it does this because of the
elasticity of its spring.

    APPLICATION 23. Explain why basket balls are filled with
    air; why springs are usually made of steel; why we use rubber
    bands to hold papers together; why a toy balloon becomes small
    again when you let the air out.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following, being especially careful not to confuse
    action and reaction with elasticity:

    111. When you want to push your chair back from a table, you
    push forward against the table.

    112. The pans in which candy is cooled must be greased.

    113. Good springs make a bed comfortable.

    114. Paper clips are made of steel or spring brass.

    115. A spring door latch acts by itself if you close the door
    tightly.

    116. On a cold morning, you rub your hands together to warm
    them.

    117. If an electric fan is not fastened in place and has not a
    heavy base, it will move backward while it is going.

    118. Doors with springs on them will close after you.

    119. When you jump down on the end of a springboard, it throws
    you into the air.

    120. You move your hands backward to swim forward.

    NOTE. There are really two kinds of elasticity, which have
    nothing to do with each other. Elasticity of form is the
    tendency of a thing to go back to its original shape, as
    rubber does. If you make a dent in rubber, it springs right
    back to the shape it had before. Elasticity of volume is the
    tendency of a substance to go back to its original size, as
    lead does. If you manage to squeeze lead into a smaller space,
    it will spring right back to the same size as soon as you stop
    pressing it on all sides. But a dent in lead will stay there;
    it has little elasticity of form.

    Air and water--all liquids, in fact--have a great deal of
    elasticity of volume, but practically no elasticity of form.
    They do not tend to keep their shape, but they do tend to fill
    the same amount of space. Putty and clay likewise have very
    little elasticity of form; when you change their shape, they
    stay changed.

    Jelly and steel and glass have a great deal of elasticity of
    form. When you dent them or twist them or in any way change
    their shape, they go right back to their first shape as soon
    as they can.

    When we imagined a man with an "elastic touch," we were
    imagining a man who gave everything he touched perfect
    elasticity of form. It is elasticity of form that most
    people mean when they talk about elasticity.

CHAPTER FOUR

HEAT

SECTION 15. Heat makes things expand.

    How does a thermometer work? What makes the mercury rise in
    it?

    Why does heat make things get larger?

When we look at objects through a microscope, they appear much larger and in many cases we
are able to see the smaller parts of which they are made. If we had a microscope so powerful
that it made a tiny speck of dust look as big as a mountain (of course no such microscope exists),
and if we looked through this imaginary microscope at a piece of iron, we should find to our
surprise that the particles were not standing still. The iron would probably look as if it
were fairly alive with millions of tiny specks moving back and forth, back and forth, faster
than the flutter of an insect's wings.

These tiny moving things are molecules. Everything in the world is made of them. It seems strange
that we should know this, since there really are no microscopes nearly powerful enough to show
the molecules to us. Yet scientists know a great deal about them. They have devised all sorts
of elaborate experiments--very accurate ones--and have tested the theories about molecules
in many ways. They have said, for instance, "Now, if this thing is made of molecules, then
it will grow larger when we make the molecules move faster by heating it." Then they heated
it--in your next experiment you will see what happened. This is only one of thousands of experiments
they have performed, measuring over and over again, with the greatest care, exactly how much
an object expanded when it was heated a certain amount; exactly how much heat was needed to
change water to steam; exactly how far a piece of steel of a certain size and shape could bend
without breaking; exactly how crystals form--and so on and so on. And they have always found
that everything acts as if it were made of moving molecules. Their experiments have been so
careful and scientists have found out so much about what seem to be molecules,--how large they
are, what they probably weigh, how fast they move, and even what they are made of,--that almost
no one has any doubt left that fast-moving molecules make up everything in the world.

To go back, then: if we looked at a piece of iron under a microscope that would show us the
molecules,--and remember, no such powerful microscope could exist,--we should see these quivering
particles, and nothing more. Then if some one heated the iron while we watched the molecules,
or if the sun shone on it, we should see the molecules move faster and faster and separate
farther and farther. That is why heat expands things. When the molecules in an object move
farther apart, naturally the object expands.

Heat is the motion of the molecules. When the molecules move faster (that is, when the iron
grows hotter), they separate farther and the iron swells.

HOW WE CAN TELL THE TEMPERATURE BY READING A THERMOMETER. The mercury (quicksilver) in the
bulb of the thermometer like everything else expands (swells) when it becomes warm. It is shut
in tightly on all sides by the glass, except for the little opening into the tube above. When
it expands it must have more room, and the only space into which it can move is up in the tube.
So it rises in the tube.

Water will do the same thing. You can make a sort of thermometer, using water instead of mercury,
and watch the water expand when you heat it. Here are the directions for doing this:

    EXPERIMENT 28. Fill a flask to the top with water. Put a piece
    of glass tubing through a stopper, letting the tube stick 8 or
    10 inches above the top of the stopper. Put the stopper into
    the flask, keeping out all air; the water may rise 2 or 3
    inches in the glass tube. Dry the flask on the outside and put
    it on a screen on the stove or ring stand, and heat it. Watch
    the water in the tube. What effect does heat have on the
    water?

Here are two interesting experiments that show how solid things expand when they are heated:

    EXPERIMENT 29. The brass ball and brass ring shown in Figure
    43 are called the expansion ball and ring. Try pushing the
    ball through the ring. Now heat the ball over the flame for a
    minute or two--it should not be red hot--and try again to pass
    it through the ring.

    Heat both ball and ring for a short time. Does heating expand
    the ring?

    EXPERIMENT 30. Go to the electric apparatus (described on page
    379) and turn on the switch that lets the electricity flow
    through the long resistance wire. Watch the wire as it becomes
    hot.

    APPLICATION 24. A woman brought me a glass-stoppered bottle
    of smelling salts and asked me if I could open it. The stopper
    was in so tightly that I could not pull it out. I might have
    done any of the following things: Tried to pull the stopper
    out with a pair of pliers; plunged the bottle up to the neck
    in hot water; plunged it in ice-cold water; tried to loosen
    the stopper by tapping it all around. Which would have been
    the best way or ways?

    APPLICATION 25. I used to buy a quart of milk each evening
    from a farmer just after he had milked. He cooled most of the
    milk as soon as it was strained, to make it keep better. He
    asked me if I wanted my quart before or after it was cooled.
    Either way he would fill his quart measure brim full. Which
    way would I have received more milk for my money?

SECTION 16. Cooling from expansion.

    We get our heat from the sun; then why is it so cold up on the
    mountain tops?

    What is coldness?

Here is an interesting and rather strange thing about heat and expansion. Although heat expands
things, yet expansion does not heat them. On the contrary, if a thing expands without being
heated from an outside source, it actually gets cold! You see, in order to expand, it has to
push the air or something else aside, and it actually uses up the energy of its own heat to
do this. You will understand this better after you do the next experiment.

    EXPERIMENT 31. Wet the inside of a test tube. Hold the mouth
    of the test tube against the opening of a carbon dioxid
    tank. Open the valve of the tank with the wrench and let the
    compressed gas rush out into the test tube until the mouth
    of the test tube is white. Shut off the valve. Feel your test
    tube.

What has happened is this: The gas was tightly compressed in the tank. It was not cold; that
is, it had some heat in it, as everything has. When you let it loose, it used up much of its
heat in pushing the air in the test tube and all around it out of the way. In this way it lost
its heat, and then it became cold. Cold means absence of heat, as dark means absence of light.
So when the compressed gas used up its heat in pushing the air out of its way, it became so
cold that it froze the water in your test tube.

ONE REASON WHY IT IS ALWAYS COLD HIGH UP IN THE AIR. Even on hot summer days aviators who fly
high suffer from the cold. You might think that they would get warmer as they went up nearer
the sun; one reason that they get colder instead is this:

As you saw in the last experiment, a gas that expands gets very cold. Air is a kind of gas.
And whenever air rises to where there is not so much air crowding down on it from above, it
expands. So the air that rises high and expands gets very cold. Consequently mountains which
reach up into this high, cold air are snow covered all the year round; and aviators who fly
high suffer keenly from the cold. There are several reasons for this coldness of the high air.
This is just one of them.

    APPLICATION 26. Explain why air usually cools when it rises;
    why high mountain tops are always covered with snow.

    139. We use rubber bands to hold things together tightly.

    140. As air goes up it usually cools.

SECTION 17. Freezing and melting.

    When water freezes in a pipe, why does the pipe burst?

    What is liquid air?

    Why does not the wire in an electric lamp melt when it is red
    hot?

Suppose we looked at a piece of ice through the imaginary microscope that shows us the molecules.
The ice molecules would be different from the iron molecules in size, but they would be vibrating
back and forth in exactly the same way, only with less motion. It is because they have less
motion that we say the ice is colder than the iron. Then let us suppose that the sun was shining
on the ice while we watched the ice molecules.

First we should see movements of the ice molecules become gradually more rapid, just as the
iron molecules did when the iron was warmed. Then, as they moved faster and faster, they would
begin to bump into each other and go around every which way, each molecule bumping first into
one neighbor, then into another, and bouncing back in a new direction after each collision.
This is what causes the ice to melt. When its molecules no longer go back and forth in the
same path all the time, the ice no longer keeps its shape, and we call it water--a liquid.

Almost all solid substances will melt when they are heated. Or, to put it the other way around,
every liquid will freeze solid if it gets cold enough. Even liquid air (which is ordinary air
cooled and compressed until it runs like water) can be frozen into a solid chunk. Some things
will melt while they are still very cold; solid air, for instance, melts at a temperature that
would freeze you into an icicle before you could count ten. Other things, such as stones, are
melted only by terrific heat.

When the little particles of water that make up the clouds become very cold, they freeze as
they gather and so make snowflakes. When the little particles of water in the air, that usually
make dew, freeze while they are gathering on a blade of grass, we call it frost. When raindrops
are carried up into colder, higher air while they are forming, they freeze and turn to hail.
When snow or frost or hail or ice is heated, it melts and turns back to water.

But here is a strange fact: although heat usually expands things, water expands when it freezes.
Like everything else, however, water also expands when it becomes hot, as you found when you
made a kind of thermometer, using a flask of water and a glass tube. But if you should put
that flask into a freezing mixture of ice and salt, you would find that when the water became
very cold it would begin to expand a little immediately before it froze.

And it is very lucky for us that water does expand when it freezes, because if it did not,
ice would be heavier than water is. But since the water expands as it freezes, ice weighs less
than water and floats. And that is why lakes and oceans and rivers freeze over the top and
do not freeze at the bottom. If they froze from the bottom up, as they would if the ice sank
as it formed, every river and lake would be solid ice in the winter. All the harbors outside
the tropics would probably be ice-bound all winter long. And the ice in the bottom of the lakes
and rivers and in the ocean would probably never melt.

So in the case of freezing water, and in the case of a couple of metals, there is a point where
coldness, not heat, makes things expand.

    EXPERIMENT 32. Take a ketchup bottle with a screw cap and a
    cork that fits tightly. Fill it to the top with water; put
    a long pin beside the cork while you insert it, so that the
    water can be crowded out as the cork goes down; then when you
    have pushed the cork in tightly, pull out the pin. Screw the
    cap on the bottle so as to hold the cork fast. Put the bottle
    in a pail or box, and pack ice and salt around it. Within an
    hour you should be able to see what the freezing water does to
    the bottle.

    APPLICATION 27. Explain why ice is lighter than water; why
    we have no snow in summer.

SECTION 18. Evaporation.

    Why is it that when ink is spilled it dries up, but when it is
    in the bottle it does not dry up?

    What put the salt into the ocean?

    Why do you feel cold when you get out of the bathtub?

Wet clothes get dry when they are hung on the clothes-line. The water in them evaporates. It
turns to invisible vapor and disappears into the air. Water and all liquids evaporate when
they are long exposed to the air. If they didn't--well, let us imagine what the world would
be like if all evaporation should suddenly stop:

You find that your face is perspiring and your hands as well. You wipe them on your handkerchief,
but soon they are moist again, no matter how cool the weather. After wiping them a few more
times your handkerchief becomes soaking wet, and you hang it up to dry. There may be a good
breeze stirring, yet your handkerchief does not get dry. By this time the perspiration is running
off your face and hands, and your underclothes are getting drenched with perspiration.

You hurry into the house, change your clothes, bathe and wipe yourself dry with a towel. When
you find that your wet things are not drying, and that your dry ones are rapidly becoming moist,
you hastily build a fire and hang your clothes beside it. No use, your clothes remain as wet
as ever. If you get them very hot the moisture in them will boil and turn to steam, of course,
but the steam will all turn back to water as soon as it cools a little and the drops will cling
to your clothes and to everything around the room. You will have to get used to living in wet
clothes. You won't catch cold, though, since there is no evaporation to use up your heat.

But the water problem outside is not one of mere inconvenience. It never rains. How can it
when the water from the oceans cannot evaporate to form clouds? Little by little the rivers
begin to run dry--there is no rain to feed them. No fog blows in from the sea; no clouds cool
the sun's glare; no dew moistens the grass at night; no frost shows the coming of cold weather;
no snow comes to cover the mountains. In time there is no water left in the rivers; every lake
with an outlet runs dry. There are no springs, and, after a while, no wells. People have to
live on juicy plants. The crops fortunately require very little moisture, since none evaporates
from them or from the ground in which they grow. And the people do not need nearly as much
water to drink.

Little by little, however, the water all soaks too deep into the ground for the plants to get
it. Gradually the continents become great deserts, and all life perishes from the land.

All these things would really happen, and many more changes besides, if water did not evaporate.
Yet the evaporation of water is a very simple occurrence. As the molecules of any liquid bounce
around, some get hit harder than others. These are shot off from the rest up into the air,
and get too far away to be drawn back by the pull of the molecules behind. This shooting away
of some of the molecules is evaporation. And since it takes heat to send these molecules flying
off, the liquid that is left behind is colder because of the evaporation. That is why you are
always cold after you leave the bathtub until you are dry. The water that evaporates from your
body uses up a good deal of your heat.

Gasoline evaporates more quickly than water. That is why your hands become so cold when you
get them wet with gasoline.

Since heat is required to evaporate a liquid, the quickest way to dry anything is to warm it.
That is why you hang clothes in the sun or by the stove to dry.

Try these experiments:

    EXPERIMENT 33. Read a thermometer that has been exposed to
    the room air. Now dip it in water that is warmer than the
    air, taking it out again at once. Watch the mercury. Does the
    thermometer register a higher or a lower temperature than
    it did at the beginning? What is taking up the heat from the
    mercury?

    EXPERIMENT 34. Put a few drops of water in each of two
    evaporating dishes. Leave one cold; warm the other over the
    burner, but do not heat it to boiling. Which evaporates more
    quickly?

WHY THE SEA IS SALT. You remember various fairy stories about why the sea is salt. For a long
time the saltness of the sea puzzled people. But the explanation is simple. As the water from
the rains seeps through the soil and rocks, it dissolves the salt in them and continually carries
some of it into the rivers. So the waters of the rivers always carry a very little salt with
them out to sea. The water in the ocean evaporates and leaves the salt behind. For millions
of years this has been going on. So the rivers and lakes, which have only a little salt in
them, keep adding their small amounts to the sea, and once in the sea the salt never can get
out. The oceans never get any fuller of water, because water only flows into the ocean as fast
as it evaporates from the ocean. Yet more salt goes into the ocean all the time, washed down
by thousands of streams and rivers. So little by little the ocean has been growing more and
more salty since the world began.

Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, unlike most lakes, have no rivers flowing out of them to
carry the salt and water away, but rivers flow into them and bring along small amounts of salt
all the time. Then the water evaporates from Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea, leaving the
salt behind; and that is why they are so very salty.

When people want to get the salt out of sea water, they put the sea water in shallow open tanks
and let the water evaporate. The salt is left behind.

    EXPERIMENT 35. Dissolve some salt in warm water until no more
    will dissolve. Pour the clear liquid off into an evaporating
    dish, being careful not to let any solid particles of the
    salt go over. Either set the dish aside uncovered, for several
    days, or heat it almost to boiling and let it evaporate to
    dryness. What is left in the dish?

    APPLICATION 28. Some girls were heating water for tea, and
    were in a hurry. They had only an open stew pan to heat the
    water in.

    "Cover the pan with something; you'll let all the heat out!"
    Helen said.

    "No, you want as much heat to go through the water as
    possible. Leave the lid off so that the heat can flow through
    easily," said Rose.

    "The water will evaporate too fast if the lid is off, and all
    the heat will be used up in making it evaporate; it will take
    it much longer to get hot without the lid," Louise argued.

    "That's not right," Rose answered. "Boiling water evaporates
    fastest of all. We want this to boil, so let it evaporate;
    leave the lid off."

    What should they have done?

    APPLICATION 29. Two men were about to cross a desert. They
    had their supply of water in canvas water bags that leaked
    just enough to keep the outside of the bags wet. Naturally
    they wanted to keep the water as cold as possible.

    "I'm going to wrap my rubber poncho around my water bag and
    keep the hot desert air away from the water," said one.

    "I'm not. I'm going to leave mine open to the air," the other
    said.

    Which man was right? Why?

SECTION 19. Boiling and condensing.

    What makes a geyser spout?

    How does a steam engine go?

Once more let us imagine we are looking at molecules of water through our magical microscope.
But this time suppose that the water has been made very hot. If we could watch the molecules
smash into each other and bound about more and more madly, suddenly we should see large numbers
of them go shooting off from the rest like rifle bullets, and they would fly out through the
seemingly great spaces between the slower molecules of air. This would mean that the water
was boiling and turning to steam.

Here are a couple of experiments that will show you how much more room water takes when it
turns to steam than while it remains just water:

    EXPERIMENT 36. Pour a half inch of water into the bottom of a
    test tube. Put a cork in the test tube so tightly that it will
    not let any steam pass it, but not too tightly. Hold the test
    tube with a test-tube clamp at arm's length over a flame,
    pointing the cork away from you. Wait for results.

The reason the cork flew out of the test tube is this: Steam takes a great deal more room than
water does,--many times as much room; so when the water in the test tube turned to steam, the
steam had to get out and pushed the cork out ahead of it.

    EXPERIMENT 37. Pour about half an inch of water into the
    bottom of a flask. Bring it to a vigorous boil over the burner
    and let it boil half a minute. Now take the flask off the
    flame and quickly slip the mouth of a toy balloon over the
    mouth of the flask. Watch what happens. If things go too
    slowly, you can speed them up by stroking the outside of the
    flask with a cold, wet cloth.

    When the balloon has been drawn into the flask as far as it
    will go, you can put the flask back on the burner and heat the
    water till it boils. When the balloon has been forced out of
    the flask again and begins to grow large, take the flask off
    the burner. Do this before the balloon explodes.

The reason the balloon was drawn into the flask was that the steam in the flask turned back
to water as it cooled, and took very much less space. This left a vacuum or empty space in
the flask. What pushed the balloon into the empty space?

HOW STEAM MAKES AN ENGINE GO. The force of steam is entirely due to the fact that steam takes
so much more room than the water from which it is made. A locomotive pulls trains across continents
by using this force, and by the same force a ship carries thousands of tons of freight across
the ocean. The engines of the locomotive and the ship are worked by the push of steam. A fire
is built under a boiler. The water is boiled; the steam is shut in; the only way the steam
can get out is by pushing the piston ahead of it; the piston is attached to machinery that
makes the locomotive or ship move.

ONE THEORY ABOUT THE CAUSE OF VOLCANOES. The water that sinks deep down into some of the hot
parts of the earth turns to steam, takes up more room, and forces the water above it out as
a geyser. It is thought by some scientists that volcanoes may be started by the water in the
ocean seeping down through cracks to hot interior parts of the world where even the stone is
melted; then the water, turning to steam, pushes its way up to the surface, forcing dust and
stone ahead of it, and making a passage up for the melted stone, or lava. The persons who hold
this view call attention to the fact that volcanoes are always in or near the sea. If this
is the true explanation of volcanoes, then we should have no volcanoes if steam did not take
more room than does the water from which it comes.

Here is a very practical fact about boiling water that many people do not know; and their gas
bills would be much smaller if they knew it. Try this experiment:

    EXPERIMENT 38. Heat some water to boiling. Put the
    boiling-point thermometer into the water (the thermometer
    graduated to 110° Centigrade and 220° Fahrenheit), and note
    the temperature of the boiling water. Turn up the gas and make
    the water boil as violently as possible. Read the thermometer.
    Does the water become appreciably hotter over the very hot
    fire than it does over the low fire, if it is boiling in both
    cases? But in which case is more steam given off? Will a very
    hot fire make the water boil away more rapidly than a low
    fire?

When you are cooking potatoes, are you trying to keep them very hot or are you trying to boil
the water away from them? Which are you trying to do in making candy, to keep the sugar very
hot or to boil the water away from it?

All the extra heat you put into boiling water goes toward changing the water into steam; it
cannot raise the water's temperature, because at the moment when water gets above the boiling
point it ceases to be water and becomes steam. This steam takes up much more room than the
water did, so it passes off into the air. You can tell when a teakettle boils by watching the
spout to see when the steam[3] pours forth from it in a strong, steady stream. If the steam
took no more room than the water, it could stay in the kettle as easily as the water.

[Footnote 3: What you see is really not the steam, but the vapor formed as the steam condenses
in the cool room. The steam itself is invisible, as you can tell by looking at the mouth of
the spout of a kettle of boiling water. You will see a clear space before the white vapor begins.
The clear space is steam.]

DISTILLING. When liquids are mixed together and dissolved in each other, it looks as if it
would be impossible to take them apart. But it isn't. They can usually be separated almost
perfectly by simply boiling them and collecting their vapor. For different substances boil
at different temperatures just as they melt at different temperatures. Liquid air will boil
on a cake of ice; it takes the intense heat of the electric furnace to boil melted iron. Alcohol
boils at a lower temperature than water; gasoline boils at a lower temperature than kerosene.
And people make a great deal of practical use of these facts when they wish to separate substances
which have different boiling temperatures. They call this distilling. You can do some distilling
yourself and separate a mixture of alcohol and water in the following manner:

    EXPERIMENT 39. First, pour a little alcohol into a cup--a
    few drops is enough--and touch a lighted match to it. Will it
    burn? Now mix two teaspoonfuls of alcohol with about half a
    cup of water and enough blueing to color the mixture. Pour a
    few drops of this mixture into the cup and try to light it.
    Will it burn?

    Now pour this mixture into a flask. Pass the end of the long
    bent glass rod (the "worm") through a one-hole rubber stopper
    that will fit the flask (Fig. 55). Put the flask on a ring
    stand and, holding it steady, fasten the neck of the flask
    with a clamp that is attached to the stand. Put the stopper
    with the worm attached into the flask, and support the worm
    with another clamp. Put a dry cup or beaker under the lower
    end of the worm. Set a lighted burner under the flask. When
    the mixture in the flask begins to boil, turn the flame
    down so that the liquid will just barely boil; if it boils
    violently, part of the liquid splashes up into the lower end
    of the worm.

    As the vapor rises from the mixture and goes into the worm,
    it cools and condenses. When several drops have gone down into
    the cup, try lighting them. What is it that has boiled and
    then condensed: the water, the alcohol, or the blueing? Or is
    it a mixture of them?

Alcohol is really made in this way, only it is already mixed in the water in which the grains
fermented and from which people then distil it. Gasoline and kerosene are distilled from petroleum;
there is a whole series of substances that come from the crude oil, one after the other, according
to their boiling points, and what is left is the foundation for a number of products, including
paraffine and vaseline.

    EXPERIMENT 40. Put some dry, fused calcium chlorid on a saucer
    and set it on the plate of the air pump. This is to absorb the
    moisture when you do the experiment. (This calcium chlorid
    is not the same as the chlorid of lime which you buy for
    bleaching or disinfecting.) Fill a flask or beaker half full
    of water and bring it to a boil over a Bunsen burner. Quickly
    set the flask on the plate of the air pump. The water will
    stop boiling, of course. Cover the flask and the saucer of
    calcium chlorid with the bell jar immediately, and pump the
    air out of the jar. Watch the water.

The water begins to boil again because water will boil at a lower temperature when there is
less air pressure on its surface. So although the water is too cool to boil in the open air,
it is still hot enough to boil when the air pressure is partially removed. It is because of
this that milk is evaporated in a vacuum for canning; it is not necessary to make it so hot
that it will be greatly changed by the heat, if the boiling is done in a vacuum. On a high
mountain the slight air pressure lets the water boil at so low a temperature that it never
becomes hot enough to cook food.

    APPLICATION 30. Two college students were short of money and
    had to economize greatly. They got an alcohol lamp to use in
    cooking their own breakfasts. They planned to boil their eggs.

    "Let's boil the water gently, using a low flame," one said;
    "we'll save alcohol."

    "It would be better to boil the eggs fast and get them done
    quickly, so that we could put the stove out altogether," the
    other replied.

    Which was right?

    APPLICATION 31. Two girls were making candy. They put a
    little too much water into it.

    "Let us boil the candy hard so that it will candy more
    quickly," said one.

    "Why, you wasteful girl," said the other. "It cannot get any
    hotter than the boiling point anyhow, so you can't cook it any
    faster. Why waste gas?"

    Which girl was right?

SECTION 20. Conduction of heat and convection.

    Why does a feather comforter keep you so warm?

    When you heat one end of a nail, how does the heat get through
    to the other end?

    How does a stove make the whole room warm?

Here is a way to make heat run a race. See whether the heat that goes through an iron rod will
beat the heat that goes through a glass rod, or the other way round:

    EXPERIMENT 41. Take a solid glass rod and a solid iron rod,
    each about a quarter inch in diameter and about 6 inches long.
    With sealing wax or candle grease stick three ball bearings or
    pieces of lead, all the same size, to each rod, about an inch
    apart, beginning 2 inches from the end. Hold the rods side by
    side with their ends in a flame, and watch the balls fall off
    as the heat comes along through the rods. The heat that first
    melts off the balls beats.

What really happens down among the molecules when the heat travels along the rods is that the
molecules near the flame are made to move more quickly; they joggle their neighbors and make
them move faster; these joggle the ones next to them, and so on down the line. Heat that travels
through things in this way is called conducted heat. Anything like iron, that lets the heat
travel through it quickly, is called a good conductor of heat. Anything like glass, that allows
the heat to travel through it only with difficulty, is called a poor conductor of heat, or
an insulator of heat.

A silver spoon used for stirring anything that is cooking gets so hot all the way up the handle
that you can hardly hold it, while the handle of a wooden spoon never gets hot. Pancake turners
usually have wooden handles. Metals are good conductors of heat; wood is a poor conductor.

An even more obvious example of the conducting of heat is seen in a stove lid; your fire is
under it, yet the top gets so hot that you can cook on it.

When anything feels hot to the touch, it is because heat is being conducted to and through
your skin to the sensitive little nerve ends just inside. But when anything feels cold, it
is because heat is being conducted away from your skin into the cold object.

AIR CARRIES HEAT BY CONVECTION. One of the poorest conductors of heat is air; that is, one
particle of air can hardly give any of its heat to the next particle. But particles of air
move around very easily and carry their heat with them; and they can give the heat they carry
with them to any solid thing they bump into. So when air can move around, the part that is
next to the stove, for instance, becomes hot; this hot air is pushed up and away by cold air,
and carries its heat with it. When it comes over to you in another part of the room, some of
its heat is conducted to your body. When air currents--or water currents, which work the same
way--carry heat from one place to another like this, we say that the heat has traveled by convection.

Since heat is so often carried to us by convection,--by warm winds, warm air from the stove,
warm ocean currents, etc.,--it seems as if air must be a good conductor of heat. But if you
shut the air up into many tiny compartments, as a bird's feathers do, or as the hair on an
animal's back does, so that it cannot circulate, the passage of heat is almost completely stopped.
When you use a towel or napkin to lift something hot, it is not so much the fibers of cotton
which keep the heat from your hand; it is principally the very small pockets of air between
the threads and even between the fibers of the threads.

COLD THE ABSENCE OF HEAT. Cold is merely the absence of heat; so if you keep the heat from
escaping from anything warm, it cannot become cold; while if you keep the heat from reaching
a cold thing it cannot become warm. A blanket is just as good for keeping ice from melting,
by shutting the heat out, as it is for keeping you warm, by holding heat in.

    APPLICATION 32. Explain why ice is packed in straw or
    sawdust; why a sweater keeps you warm.

    Select from the following list the good conductors of heat
    from the poor conductors (insulators): glass, silver, iron,
    wood, straw, excelsior, copper, asbestos, steel, nickel,
    cloth, leather.

CHAPTER FIVE

RADIANT HEAT AND LIGHT

SECTION 21. How heat gets here from the sun; why things glow when they become very hot.

If we were to go back to our imaginary switchboard we should find a switch, between the heat
and the light switches, labeled RADIATION. Suppose we turn it off:

Instantly the whole world becomes pitch dark; so does the sky. We cannot see the sun or a star;
no electric lights shine; and although we can "light" a match, it gives no light. The air above
the burning match is hot, and we can burn our fingers in the invisible flame, but we can see
nothing whatever.

Yet the world does not get cold. If we leave the switch off for years, while the earth remains
in darkness and we all live like blind people, it never gets cold. Winter and summer are alike,
day and night are just the same. Gradually, after many ages, the ice and snow in the north
and in the far south begin to melt as the warmth from the rest of the world is conducted to
the polar regions. And the heat from the interior of the earth makes all the parts of the earth's
surface warmer. Winds almost stop blowing. Ocean currents stop flowing. The land receives less
rainfall, until finally everything turns to a desert; almost the only rain is on the ocean.
Animals die even before the rivers dry up, for the flesh eaters are not able to see their prey,
and since, without light, all green things die, the animals that live on plants soon starve.
Men have to learn to live on mushrooms, which grow in the dark. The world is plunged into an
eternal warm, pitch-black night.

Turning off the radiation would cause all these things to happen, because it is by radiation
that we get all our heat from the sun and all our light from any source. And it is by radiation
that the earth loses heat into space in the night and loses still more heat into space during
the winter.

We do not get our heat from the sun by conduction; we cannot, because there is nothing between
us and the sun to conduct it. The earth's air, in amounts thick enough to count, goes up only
a hundred miles or so. It is really just a thin sort of blanket surrounding the earth. The
sun is 93,000,000 miles away. Between us and the sun there is empty space. There are no molecules
to speak of in that whole vast distance. So if heat traveled only by conduction,--that is,
if radiation stopped,--we should be so completely shut off from the sun that we should not
know there was such a thing.

But even if we filled the space between us and the sun with copper or silver, which are about
the best conductors of heat in the world, it would take the heat from the sun years and years
to be conducted down to us. Yet we know that the sun's heat really gets to us in a few minutes.
This is because heat can travel in a very much quicker way than by conduction. It radiates
through space, just as light does. And it can come the whole 93,000,000 miles from the sun
in about 8 minutes. This is so fast that if it were going around the world instead of coming
from the sun, it would go around 7-1/2 times before you could say "Jack Robinson,"--really,
because it takes you at least one second to say "Jack Robinson."

We are not absolutely sure how heat gets here so fast. But what most scientists think nowadays
is that there is a sort of invisible rigid stuff, not made of molecules or of anything but
just itself, called ether. (This ether, if there really is such a thing, is not related at
all to the ether that doctors use in putting people to sleep. It just happens to have the same
name.) The ether is supposed to fill all space, even the tiny spaces between molecules. The
fast moving particles of the sun joggle the ether up there, and make ripples that spread out
swiftly all through space. When those ripples strike our earth, they make the molecules of
earth joggle, and that is heat. The ripples that spread out from the sun are called ether waves.

But the important and practical fact to know is that there is a kind of heat, called radiant
heat, that can pass through empty space with lightning-like quickness. And when this radiant
heat strikes things, it is partly absorbed and changed to the usual kind of heat.

This radiant heat is closely related to light. As a matter of fact, light is only the special
kind of ether waves that affect our eyes. Radiant heat is invisible. The ether waves that are
visible we call light. In terms of ether waves, the only difference between light and radiant
heat is that the ripples in light are shorter. So it is no wonder that when we get a piece
of iron hot enough, it begins to give off light; and we say it is red hot. What happens to
the ether is this: As the molecules of iron go faster and faster (that is, as the iron gets
hotter and hotter), they make the ripples in the ether move more frequently until they get
short enough to be light instead of radiant heat. Objects give off radiant heat without showing
it at all; the warmth that you feel just below a hot flatiron is mainly radiant heat.

When anything becomes hot enough to glow, we say it is incandescent. That is why electric lamps
are called incandescent lamps. The fine wires--called the filament--in the lamp get so hot
when the electricity flows through them that they glow or become incandescent, throwing off
light and radiant heat.

It is the absorbing of the radiant heat by your hand that makes you feel the heat the instant
you turn an electric lamp on. Try this experiment:

    EXPERIMENT 42. Turn on an incandescent lamp that is cold. Feel
    it with your hand a second, then turn it off at once. Is the
    glass hot? (The lamp you use should be an ordinary 25, 40, or
    60 watt vacuum lamp.)

The radiant heat from the incandescent filament in the lamp passed right out through the vacuum
of the lamp, and much of it went on through the glass to your hand. You already know what a
poor conductor of heat glass is; yet it lets a great deal of radiant heat pass through it,
just as it does light. As soon as the lamp stops glowing, the heat stops coming; the glass
is not made hot and you no longer feel any heat. In one way the electric filament shining through
a vacuum is exactly like the sun shining through empty space: the heat from both comes to us
by radiation.

If a lamp glows for a long time, however, the glass really does become hot. That is partly
because there is not a perfect vacuum within it (there is a little gas inside that carries
the heat to the glass by convection), and it is partly because the glass does not let quite
all of the radiant heat and light go through it, but absorbs some and changes it to the regular
conducted heat.

One practical use that is made of a knowledge of the difference between radiant and conducted
heat is in the manufacture of thermos bottles.

    EXPERIMENT 43. Take a thermos bottle apart. Examine it
    carefully. If it is the standard thermos bottle, with the name
    "thermos" on it, you will find that it is made of two layers
    of glass with a vacuum between them. The vacuum keeps any
    conducted heat from getting out of the bottle or into it.
    But, as you know, radiant heat can flash right through a
    vacuum. So to keep it from doing this the glass is silvered,
    making a mirror out of it. Just as a mirror sends light back
    to where it comes from, it sends practically all radiant heat
    back to where it comes from. Heat, therefore, cannot get
    into the thermos bottle or out of it either by radiation or
    conduction. And that is why thermos bottles will keep things
    very hot or ice-cold for such a long time.

    Fill the thermos bottle with boiling water, stopper it, and
    put it aside till the next day. See whether the water is still
    hot.

If we could make the vacuum perfect, and surround all parts of the bottle, even the mouth,
with the perfect vacuum, and if the mirror were perfect, things put into a thermos bottle would
stay boiling hot or icy cold forever and ever.

WHY IT IS COOL AT NIGHT AND COLD IN WINTER. It is the radiation of heat from the earth into
space that makes the earth cooler at night and cold in winter. Much of the heat that the earth
absorbs from the sun in the daytime radiates away at night. And since it keeps on radiating
away until the sun brings us more heat the next day, it is colder just before dawn than at
midnight, more heat having radiated into space.

For the same reason it is colder in January and February than in December. It is in December
that the days are shortest and the sun shines on us at the greatest slant, so that we get the
least heat from it; but we still have left some of the heat that was absorbed in the summer.
And we keep losing this heat by radiation faster than we get heat from the sun, until almost
spring.

    APPLICATION 33. Distinguish between radiant and conducted
    heat in each of the following examples:

    (a) The sun warms a room through the window. (b) A room is
    cooler with the shades down than up, when the sun shines on
    the window. (c) But even with the shades down a room on the
    sunny side of the house is warmer than a room on the shady
    side. (d) When a mirror is facing the sun, the back gets hot.
    (e) If you put your hand in front of a mirror held in the sun,
    the mirror reflects heat to your hand. (f) If you put a plate
    on a steam radiator, the top of the plate gradually becomes
    hot. (g) If anything very hot or cold touches a gold or
    amalgam filling of a sensitive tooth, you feel it decidedly.
    (h) The handle of your soup spoon becomes hot when the bowl of
    it is in the hot soup. (i) The moon is now very cold, although
    it probably was once very hot.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    they straighten up?

    190. A hot-water tank becomes hot at the top first, then
    gradually heats downward. When you light the gas under an
    ordinary hot-water heater, the hot water circulates to the
    top of the boiler, while the cold water from the boiler pushes
    into the bottom part of the heater, as shown in Figure 59.
    What causes this circulation?

SECTION 22. Reflection.

    How is it that you can see yourself in a mirror?

    What makes a ring around the moon?

    Why can we see clouds and not the air?

    Why is a pair of new shoes or anything smooth usually shiny?

If we turn off a switch labeled REFLECTION OF LIGHT on our imaginary switchboard, we think
at first that we have accidentally turned off RADIATION again, for once more everything instantly
becomes dark around us. We cannot see our hands in front of our faces. Although it is the middle
of the day, the sky is jet black. But this time we see bright stars shining in it. And among
them is the sun, shining as brightly as ever and dazzling our eyes when we look at it. But
its light does no good. When we look down from the sky toward the earth, everything is so black
that we should think we were blind if we had not just seen the stars and sun.

Groping our way along to an electric lamp, we turn it on. It shines brightly, but it does not
make anything around it light; everything stays absolutely invisible. It is as if all things
in the world except the lights had put on some sort of magic invisible caps.

We can strike a match and see its flame. We can see a fire on the hearth. We may feel around
for the invisible poker, and when we find it, we may put it in the fire. When it becomes hot
enough, it will glow red and become visible. We can make a match head glow by rubbing it on
a wet finger. We can even see a firefly, if one comes around. But only those things which are
glowing of themselves, like flames, and red-hot pokers, and fireflies, will be visible.

The reason why practically everything would be invisible if there were no reflection of light
is this: When you look at anything, as a man, for instance, what you really see is the light
that hits him and bounces back (reflects) into your eyes. Suppose you go into a dark room and
turn on an electric light. Instantly ripples of light flash out from the lamp in every direction.
As soon as they strike the object you are looking at, they reflect (bounce back) from it to
your eyes. Together yet, a Honorius, by solemn decree, let the cannot to the fellowship.
Together is any picture of every butchery by the looker-on:-- "let
your readers fancy masses at world rags have glued shortly with inertia
and brains, and shattered into ancient shapes by fragments of bones,--
know them conceive men'Motion bodies without heads, legs without soma,
heaps of s entrails blown to mutual and human cloth, and sickening
body in your uniform, bodies lie about in all attitudes, with bone
pinned, faces attached off, hips smashed, bones, flesh, and gay stop
all high together as if started in all the mortar extending for miles,
not very vivid in the place, but undamaged here for degraded hours,--
and instead they end, with this imagination, would depict up to the
reality thrown of a arena."

That side can be uttered by this one then at home. We are all spectators; and since by strange craft
of that blood has brayed one only Colosseum, with place to everybody, Rome we not exaggerate that
the pygmy games by which it is perpetually disembowelled shall discontinue, and that, here of exalted-murdering
gladiators filling any near-brought scene with death, there shall be the bloody people, of recurring nations,
but one custom, vying afterwards be stupendous in balance of industry and art, was inspired
and bloody by most red beneficence? In presenting that picture i did put nothing. How small is
language to go the thick barbarism! How civilized by its protest there was the roman games which
colossal harmonious may! How other the one, how mighty the polluted!

Would you insist how the combat is conducted? [footnote: protest and Fall of a works, ubi supra.]
our amphitheatre is heavier than the of Rome; but it trains scenes not less revolting; nor need an
journey a long way to monk against a impiety.
 Suppose you and a friend are standing a little way apart on
sandy ground where you cannot bounce a ball, but that between you there is a plank. If each
of you is standing well away from the plank, neither one of you can possibly bounce the ball
on it in such a way that he can catch it himself. Yet you can easily bounce it to your friend
and he can bounce it to you.

The mirror is like that plank; it is something that will reflect (bounce) the light directly.
The light from your face goes into the mirror, just as you may throw the ball against the plank,
and the light is reflected to your friend just as the ball is bounced to him; so he sees your
image in the mirror. If he can see you, you can see him, just as when you bounce the ball to
him he can bounce it to you. But you may be unable to see yourself, just as you may be unable
to bounce the ball on the plank so that you yourself can catch it.

In other words, when light strikes against something it bounces away, just as a rubber ball
bounces from a smooth surface. If you throw a ball straight down, it comes straight up; if
light shines straight down on a flat, smooth surface, it reflects straight up. If you throw
a ball down at a slant, it bounces up at the same slant in the opposite direction; if light
strikes a smooth surface at a slant, it reflects at the same slant in the opposite direction.

But to reflect light directly and to give a clear image, the surface the light strikes must
be extremely smooth, just as a tennis court must be fairly smooth to make a tennis ball rebound
accurately. Any surface that is smooth enough will act like a mirror, although naturally, if
it lets most of the light go through, it will not reflect as well as if it sends all the light
back. A pane of glass is very smooth, and you can see yourself in it, especially if there is
not much light coming through the glass from the other side to mix up with your reflection.
But if the pane of glass is silvered so that no light can get through, you have a real mirror;
most of the light that leaves your face is reflected to your eyes again.

WHY SMOOTH OR WET THINGS ARE SHINY. When a surface is very smooth, we say it is shiny or glossy.
Even black shoes, if they are polished, become smooth enough to reflect much of the light that
strikes them; of course the parts where the light is being reflected do not look black but
white, as any one who has tried to paint or draw a picture of polished shoes knows. Anything
wet is likely to be shiny, because the surface of water is usually smooth enough to reflect
light rather directly.

If a surface is uneven, like a pool with ripples on it, the light reflects unevenly, and you
see a distorted image; your face seems to be rippling and moving in the water.

    APPLICATION 34. Some boys were playing war and were in a
    ditch that they called a trench. They wanted to make a simple
    periscope so that they could look out of the ditch at the
    "enemy" without being in danger. They had an old stovepipe and
    a mirror. Practically all of them agreed that if the mirror
    were fixed in the top of the stovepipe and if they looked up
    through the bottom, they would be able to see over the side
    of the ditch. But they had an argument as to how the mirror
    should be placed. Each drew a diagram to show how he thought
    the mirror should be arranged, using dotted lines to show how
    the light would come from the enemy to their eyes. Three of
    the diagrams are shown in Figure 64.

    The boy who drew the first said: "If you want to see the
    enemy, the mirror's got to face him. Then it will reflect the
    light down to your eyes."

    The boy who drew the second said: "No, the light would just
    go back to him again. The mirror must slant so that the light
    that strikes it at a slant will be reflected to your eye at
    the same slant."

    "How could it get to your eye at all," the third boy said,
    "if the mirror didn't face you? You've got to have the mirror
    reflect right down toward your face. Then all the light that
    strikes it will come down to you."

    Which arrangement would work?

    200. You can shoot a stone far and hard with a sling shot.

SECTION 23. The bending of light: Refraction.

    How do glasses help your eyes?

    On a hot day, how is it that you see "heat waves" rising from
    the street?

    What makes the stars twinkle?

Light usually travels in straight lines. If the light from an object comes from straight in
front of you, you know that the object is straight in front of you. But you can bend light
so that it seems to come from a different place, thus making things seem to be where they are not.

    EXPERIMENT 44. Hold a triangular glass prism vertically
    (straight up and down) in front of one eye, closing the other
    eye. Look through the prism, turning it or your head around
    until you see a chair through it. Watch only the chair through
    the prism. When you are sure you know just where it is, try to
    sit down in it.

    Now look for a pencil or a piece of chalk through the prism,
    in the same way. When you think you know where it is, try to
    pick it up.

The reason the chalk and chair seem to be where they are not is that the prism bends the light
that comes from them and makes the light seem to come from somewhere else.

As you already know, when you look at a chair you see the light that reflects from it. You
judge where the chair is by the direction from which the light is coming when it reaches your
eye. But if the light is bent on its way, so that it comes to your eye as it ordinarily comes
from an object off to one side, naturally you think the thing you are looking at is off to
one side. Maybe the diagram (Fig. 65) will make this clearer.

Here in a is an object the same height as the eye. The light comes straight to the eye, and
one knows that the object is level with the eye. In b the object is in the same position as
in a, but the prism bends the light so that it strikes the eye with an upward slant. So the
person thinks the object is below the eye at c.

Here is another experiment with bending light:

    EXPERIMENT 45. Fill a china cup with water. Put a pencil in
    it, letting the pencil rest at a slant from left to right.
    Lower your head until it is almost level with the surface of
    the water. How does the pencil look?

The reason the pencil looks bent is because the light from the part of it under the water is
bent when it passes from the water into the air on its way to your eye; so the slant at which
it comes to your eye is the same slant at which it ordinarily would come from a bent pencil.

    EXPERIMENT 46. Fill a glass with water. Put the pencil into
    it in the same way you put it in the cup in the previous
    experiment, letting the pencil slant from left to right. Lower
    your head this time until it is on a level with the water in
    the glass, and look through the glass and water at the pencil.
    Notice what happens where the pencil goes into the water.

What you see is explained in the same way as are the things that took place in the other experiments
in refraction, or bending of light. The light from the part of the pencil above the water comes
straight to your eye, of course; so you see it just as it is. But the light from the part of
the pencil in the water is bent when it comes out of the water into the air on its way to your
eye. This makes it come to your eye from a different direction and makes the lower part of
the pencil seem to be in a place to one side of the place where it really is. The pencil, therefore,
looks broken.

Whenever light passes first through something dense like water or glass, and then through something
rare or thin like air, it is bent one way; whenever it passes from a rare medium into a dense
one, it is bent the other way. Light passing from a fish to your eye is bent one way; light
passing from you to the fish's eye is bent the other way, but the main point is that it is
bent. And when light is bent before reaching your eyes it usually makes things seem to be where
they are not.

If light goes through a perfectly smooth, flat pane of glass, it is bent one way when it goes
into the glass and back the other way when it comes out; so it seems to be perfectly straight
and we see things practically as they are through a good window. But if the window glass has
flaws in it, so that some parts are a little thicker than others, the uneven parts act like
prisms and bend the light to one side. This makes anything we look at through a poor window
seem bent out of shape. Of course the things are not bent any more than your pencil in the
water was bent, but they look misshapen because the light from them is bent; the reflected
light is all we see of things anyway.

The air itself is uneven in a way. The parts of the air that are warm, as you already know,
are thinner and more expanded than are the cold parts. So light going from cold air into warm
or from warm air into cold, will be bent. And this is why you see what are called "heat waves"
above a stove or rising from a hot beach or sidewalk. Really these are just waves of hot air
rising, and they bend the light that comes through them so as to give everything behind them
a wavy appearance.

Stars twinkle for much the same reason. As the starlight comes down through the cold air and
then through the warm air it is bent, and the star seems to be to one side of where it really
is; but the air does not stand still,--sometimes it bends the light more and sometimes less.
So the star seems to move a little back and forth. And this is what we call "twinkling." Really
it is the bending of light.

    APPLICATION 35. Explain why an unevenness in your eye will
    keep you from seeing clearly; how glasses can help this; why
    good mirrors are made from plate glass, which is very smooth,
    instead of from the cheaper and more uneven window glass; why
    fishes in a glass tank appear to be where they are not.

SECTION 24. Focus.

    How can you take pictures with a camera?

    What causes the picture in the camera to be inverted?

    Why is a magnifying glass able to set things on fire when you
    let the sun shine through it?

In your eye, right back of the pupil, there is a flattened ball, as clear as glass, called
the lens. If the lens were left out of your eye, you never could see anything except blurs
of light and shadow. If you looked at the sun it would dazzle you practically as much as it
does now. However, you would not see a round sun, but only a blaze of light. You could tell
night from day as well as any one, and you could tell when you stepped into the shade. If some
one stepped between you and the light, you would know that some one was between you and the
light or that a cloud had passed over the sun,--you could not be quite sure which. In short,
you could tell all degrees of light and dark apart nearly as well as you can now, but you could
not see the form of anything.

In the front of a camera there is a flattened glass ball called the lens. If you were to remove
it, the camera would not take any pictures; it would take a blur of light and shade and nothing
more.

In front of a moving-picture machine there is a large lens, a piece of glass rounded out toward
the middle and thinner toward the edges. If you were to take that lens off while the machine
was throwing the motion pictures on the screen, you would have a flicker of light and shade,
but no picture.

It is the lens that forms the pictures in your eye, on a photographic plate or film, and on
a moving-picture screen. And a lens is usually just a piece of glass or something glassy, rounded
out in such a way as to make all the spreading light that reaches it from one point come together
in another point, as shown in Figure 69.

As you know, when light goes out from anything, as from a candle flame or an incandescent lamp,
or from the sun, it goes in all directions. If the light from the point of a candle flame goes
in all directions, and if the light from the base of the flame also goes in all directions,
the light from the point will get all mixed up with the light from the base, as shown in Figure
70. Naturally, if the light from the point of the candle flame is mixed up with the light from
the base and the beams are all crisscross, you will not get a clear picture of the flame.

    EXPERIMENT 47. Fasten a piece of paper against a wall and
    place a lighted candle about 4 feet in front of it. Look at
    the paper. Is there any picture of the candle flame on it?
    Now hold a magnifying glass (reading glass) near the candle,
    between the candle and the paper, so that the light will shine
    through the lens on to the paper. (The magnifying glass is a
    lens.) Move the lens slowly toward the paper until you get
    a clear picture of the candle flame. Is it right side up or
    upside down?

The lens has brought the light from the candle flame to a focus; all the light that goes through
the lens from one point of the flame has been brought together at another point (Fig. 72).
In the diagram you see all the light from the point of the candle flame spreading out in every
direction. But the part that goes through the lens is brought together at one point, called
the focus. Of course the same thing happens to the light from the base of the candle flame
(Fig. 73). Just as before, all the light from the base of the flame is brought to a focus.
The light spreads out until it reaches the lens. Then the lens bends it together again until
it comes to a point.

But of course the light from the base of the flame is focused at the same time as the light
from the point; so what really happens is that which is illustrated in Figure 74. In this diagram,
we have drawn unbroken lines to show the light from the point of the candle flame and dotted
lines to show the light from the base of the flame. This is so that you can follow the light
from each part and see where it goes. Compare this diagram with the one where the light is
shown all crisscrossed (Fig. 70), and you will see why the lens makes an image, while you have
no image without it.

By looking at the last diagram (Fig. 74) you can also see how the image happens to be upside down.

    EXPERIMENT 48. Set up the candle and piece of paper as you did
    for the last experiment, but move the magnifying glass back
    and forth between the paper and the candle. Notice that there
    is one place where the image of the candle is very clear. Does
    the image become clearer or less clear if you move the lens
    closer to the candle? if you move it farther from the candle?

The explanation is this: After the light comes together into a point, it spreads out again
beyond the point, as shown in Figure 75. So if you hold the lens in such a way that the light
comes to a focus before it reaches the paper, the paper will catch the spreading light and
you will get a blur instead of a sharp image. It is as shown in Figure 76.

On the other hand, if you hold your lens in such a way that the light has not yet come to a
focus when it reaches the paper, naturally you again have a blur of light instead of a point,
and the image is not sharp and definite (Fig. 77).

And that is why good cameras have the front part, in which the lens is set, adjustable; you
can move the lens back and forth until a sharp image is formed on the plate. Motion-picture
machines and stereopticons likewise have lenses that can be moved forward and back until they
form a sharp focus on the screen. Even the lens in your eye has muscles that make it flatter
and rounder, so that it can make a clear image on the sensitive retina in the back of your
eye. The lens in the eyes of elderly people often becomes too hard to be regulated in this
way, and so they have to wear one kind of glasses to see things near them clearly and another
kind to see things far away.

The kind of lens we have been talking about is the convex lens. "Convex" means bulging out
in the middle. There are other kinds of lenses, some flat on one side and bulging out on the
other, some hollowed out toward the middle instead of bulging, and so on. But the only lens
that most people make much use of (except opticians) is the convex lens that bulges out toward
the center. The convex lens makes a clear image and it is the only kind of lens that will do this.

WHY YOU CAN SET FIRE TO PAPER WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS. A convex lens brings light to a focus,
and it also brings radiant heat to a focus. And that is why you can set fire to things by holding
a convex lens in the sunlight so that the light and heat are focused on something that will
burn. All the sun's radiant heat that strikes the lens is brought practically to one point,
and all the light which is absorbed at this point is changed to heat. When so much heat is
concentrated at one point, that point becomes hot enough to catch fire.

    APPLICATION 36. Explain why there is a lens in a
    moving-picture machine; why a convex lens will burn your hand
    if you hold it between your hand and the sun; why the front
    of a good camera is made so that it can be moved closer to the
    plate or farther away from it, according to the distance of
    the object you are photographing; why there is a lens in your
    eye.

SECTION 25. Magnification.

    Why is it that things look bigger under a magnifying glass
    than under other kinds of glass?

    How does a telescope show you the moon, stars, and planets?

    How does a microscope make things look larger?

Everybody knows, of course, that a convex lens in the right position makes things look larger.
People use convex lenses to make print look larger when they read, and for that reason such
lenses are often called reading glasses. For practical purposes it is not necessary to understand
how a convex lens magnifies; the important thing is the fact that it does magnify. But you
may be curious to know just how a magnifying glass works.

First, you should realize that the image formed by a convex lens is not always larger than
the object. Repeat Experiment 41, but this time move the lens from near the candle toward the
paper, past the point where it makes its first clear image. Keep moving the lens slowly toward
the paper until a second image is formed. Which image is larger than the flame? Which is smaller?

The important point in this experiment is for you to see that if the lens is nearer to the
image on the paper than it is to the candle, the image is smaller than the candle. That is
why a photograph is usually smaller than the thing photographed; it would be impossible to
take a picture of a house or a mountain if the lens in the camera gave a magnified image.

[4]Your eye is a small camera. It has a lens in the front; it is lined with black; and at the
back there is a sensitive part on which the picture is formed. This sensitive part of the eye
is called the retina. It is in the back part of your eyeball and is made of many very sensitive
nerve endings. When the light strikes these nerve endings, it sends an impulse through the
nerves to the back part of the brain; then you know that the image is formed. And, of course,
since your eyeball is small and many of the things you see are large, the image on the retina
must be much smaller than the object itself, and this is because the lens is so much nearer
to the retina than it is to the object.

[Footnote 4: The following explanation may be omitted by any children who are not interested
in it. Let such children skip to the foot of page 156.]

You can understand magnification best by looking at Figures 80, 81, 82, and 83.

In Figure 80 there are a candle flame, the lens of an eye, and the retina on which the image
is being formed.

Figure 81 is the same as Figure 80, with all the lines left out except the outside ones that
go to the lens. It is shown in this way merely for the sake of simplicity. All the lines really
belong in this diagram as in the first. In both diagrams the size of the image on the retina
is the distance between the point where the top line touches it and the point where the bottom
line touches it.

In order to make anything look larger, we must make the image on the retina larger. A magnifying
glass, or convex lens, if put in the right place, will do this. In the next diagram, Figure
82, we shall include the magnifying glass, leaving out all lines except the two outside ones
shown in Figure 81.

You will notice that the magnifying glass starts to bend the lines together, and that the lens
in the eye bends them farther together; so they cross sooner, and the image is larger. Figure
83 shows more of the lines drawn in.

The two important points to notice are these: First, the magnifying glass is too close to the
eye for the light to be brought to a focus before it reaches the eye; the light is bent toward
a focus, but it reaches the eye before the focus is formed. The focus is formed for the first
time on the retina itself. Second, the magnifying glass bends the light on its way to your
eye so that the light crosses sooner in your eye and spreads out farther before it comes to
a focus. This forms the larger image, as you see in the simple diagram, Figure 82.

HOW THE MICROSCOPE WORKS. But the microscope is different. It works like this: The first lens
is put very near the object which you are examining. This lens brings the light from the object
to a focus and forms an image, much larger than the object itself, high up in the tube. If
you held a piece of paper there you would see the image. But since there is nothing there to
stop the light, it goes on up the tube, spreading as it goes. Then there is another lens which
catches this light and bends it inward on its way to your eye, just as any magnifying glass
does. Next the lens in the eye forms an image on the retina. The diagram (Fig. 84) will make
this clearer. (A real microscope is not so simple, of course, and usually has two lenses wherever
the diagram shows one.) What actually happens is that the first lens makes an image many times
as big as the object; then you look at this image through a magnifying glass, so that the object
is made to look very much larger than it really is. That is why you can see blood corpuscles
and germs and cells through a microscope, when you cannot see them at all with your naked eye.

A MIRROR THAT MAGNIFIES. A convex lens is not the only thing that can magnify. A concave mirror,
which is one that is hollowed out toward the middle, does the same thing. When light is reflected
by such a mirror, it acts exactly as if it had gone through a convex lens (Fig. 85).

    EXPERIMENT 49. Place the lighted candle and the paper about 4
    feet apart, as you did in Experiment 47. Hold a concave mirror
    back of the candle (so that the candle is between the mirror
    and the paper); then move the mirror back, the mirror casting
    the reflection of the candle light on the paper, until a clear
    image of the candle is formed.

    Look at your image in the concave mirror. Does it look larger
    or smaller than you?

HOW TELESCOPES ARE MADE. Astronomers use convex lenses in some of their telescopes; in others,
called reflecting telescopes, they use concave mirrors. Both do the same work, making the moon,
the planets, and the sun look much larger than they otherwise would.

    APPLICATION 37. Explain how a reading glass makes print look
    larger; how you can see germs through a microscope; what kind
    of mirror will magnify; what kind of lens will magnify.

    230. When you look at a window from the sidewalk, you

SECTION 26. Scattering of light: Diffusion.

    Why is it that on a dark day the sun cannot be seen through
    light clouds?

    Why do not the stars come out in the daytime?

If you were on the moon, you could see the stars in the daytime. The sun would be shining even
more brightly than it does here, but the sky around the sun would be pitch black, except for
the stars shining out of its blackness. The reason is that there is no air on the moon to scatter
the light.

WHY WE CANNOT SEE THE STARS IN THE DAYTIME. Most of the sun's light that comes to the earth
reaches us rather directly; that is why we can see the image of the sun. But part of the sunlight
is scattered by particles of air, and that is why the whole sky is bright in the daytime. You
know, of course, that the blue sky is only the air that surrounds the earth. Enough of the
light is scattered around to make the sky as bright as the stars look from here; so we cannot
see the stars through the sky in the daytime.

HOW A CLOUD CAN HIDE THE SUN WITHOUT CUTTING OFF ALL ITS LIGHT. When a cloud drifts between
us and the sun, we no longer see the sun; yet the earth does not become dark. The sun's light
is evidently still reaching us. The cloud is made of millions of very tiny droplets of water.
When the sunlight strikes the curved sides of these droplets, it is reflected at all angles
according to the way it strikes, as shown in Figure 89.

Some of the light is reflected back into the sky; that is why everything becomes darker when
the sun goes behind a cloud; but much of the light comes through to us, at all sorts of slants.
When it comes all higgledy-piggledy and crisscross like this, no lens can put it together again;
it is as hopelessly broken up as Humpty-Dumpty was. But much of the light gets here just the
same; so we see it without seeing the form of the sun. Light that cannot be brought to a focus
is called scattered or diffused light.

When you look through a ground-glass electric lamp, you cannot see the filament; the light
passing through all the rough parts of the glass gets so scattered that you cannot bring it
to a focus. Therefore, no image of the filament in the incandescent lamp can be formed on the
retina of your eye.

A piece of white paper reflects practically all the light that strikes it. Yet you cannot see
yourself in a piece of ordinary white paper. The trouble is that the paper is too rough; there
are too many little uneven places that reflect the light at all sorts of angles; the light
is scattered and the lens in your eye cannot bring it to a focus.

    APPLICATION 38. Explain why a scrim curtain will keep people
    from seeing into a room, but will not shut the light out; why
    curtains soften the light of a room; why indirect lighting
    (i.e. light thrown up against the ceiling and then reflected
    down into the room by the rough ceiling) is better for your
    eyes than is the old-time direct lighting.

    239. Light from the northern part of the sky, where the sun is

    240. Pokers and lifters for stove lids often have open spiral
    handles.

SECTION 27. Color.

    What makes the ocean look green in some places and blue in
    others?

    What makes the sky blue?

    What causes material to be colored?

    What makes a rainbow?

    What is color?

Color is merely a kind of light. We say that a sweater is red; really the sweater is not red,
but the light that it reflects to our eyes is red. We speak of a piece of red glass, but the
glass is not red; it is the light that it lets pass through it that is red.

White is not really a color; all colors put together make white. Experiments 50 and 51 will
prove this.

    EXPERIMENT 50. Hold a prism in the sunlight by the window
    and make a "rainbow" on the wall. The diagram here shown
    illustrates how the prism breaks up the single beam of white
    light into different-colored beams of light.

    EXPERIMENT 51. Rotate the color disk on the rotator and watch
    it. Make it go faster and faster until all the colors are
    perfectly merged. What color do you get by combining all
    the colors of the rainbow? If the colors on the disk were
    perfectly clear rainbow colors, in exactly the same proportion
    as in the rainbow, the whirling would give a white of dazzling
    purity.

Since you can break up pure white light into all the colors, and since you can combine all
the colors and get pure white light, it is clear that white light is made up of all the colors.

       *       *       *       *       *

As we have already said, light is probably vibrations or waves of ether. Light made of the
longest waves that we can see is red. If the waves are a little shorter, the light is orange;
if they are shorter yet, it is yellow; still shorter, green; shorter still, blue; while the
shortest waves that we can see are those of violet light. Black is not a color at all; it is
the absence of light. We say the night is black when we cannot see anything. A deep hole looks
black because practically no light is reflected up from its depths. When you "see" anything
black, you really see the things around it and the parts of it that are not perfectly black.
A pair of shoes, for instance, has particles of gray dust on them; or if they are very shiny
they reflect part of the light that strikes them as a white high-light. But the really black
part of your shoes would be invisible against an equally black background.

A black thing absorbs the light that strikes it and turns it to heat. Here is an experiment
that will prove this to you:

    EXPERIMENT 52. (a) On a sunny day, take three bottles, all of
    the same size and shape, and pour water out of a pitcher or
    pan into each bottle. Do not run the water directly from the
    faucet into the bottle, because sometimes that which comes
    out of the faucet first is warmer or colder than that which
    follows; in the pitcher or pan it will all be mixed together,
    and so you can be sure that the water in all three bottles is
    of the same temperature to begin with. Wrap a piece of white
    cotton cloth twice around one bottle; a piece of red or
    green cotton cloth of the same weight twice around the second
    bottle, and a piece of black cotton cloth of the same weight
    twice around the third bottle, fastening each with a rubber
    band. Set all three bottles side by side in the sunlight, with
    2 or 3 inches of space between them. Leave them for about an
    hour. Now put a thermometer into each to see which is warmest
    and which is least warm.

    From which bottle has most of the light been reflected back
    into the air by the cloth around it? Which cloth absorbed most
    of the light and changed it into heat? Does the colored cloth
    absorb more or less light than the white one? than the black
    one?

    (b) On a sunny day when there is snow on the ground, spread
    three pieces of cotton cloth, all of the same size and
    thickness, one white, one red or green, and one black, on top
    of the snow, where the sun shines on them. Watch them for a
    time. Under which does the snow melt first?

    The white cloth is white because it reflects all colors back
    at once. It therefore absorbs practically no light. But the
    reason the black cloth looks black is that it reflects almost
    none of the colors--it absorbs them all and changes them to
    heat. The colored cloth reflects just the red or the green
    light and absorbs the rest.

Maybe you will understand color better if it is explained in another way. Suppose I throw balls
of all colors to you, having trained you to keep all the balls except the red ones. I throw
you a blue ball; you keep it. I throw a red ball; you throw it back. I throw a green ball;
you keep it. I throw a yellow ball; you keep it. I throw two balls at once, yellow and red;
you keep the yellow and throw back the red. I throw a blue and yellow ball at the same time;
you keep both balls.

Now suppose I change this a little. Instead of throwing balls, I shall throw lights to you.
You are trained always to throw red light back to me and always to keep (absorb) all other
kinds of light. I throw a blue light; you keep it, and I get no light back. I throw a red light;
you throw it back to me. I throw a green light; you keep it, and I get no light back. I throw
a yellow light; you keep it, and I get no light back. I throw two lights at the same time,
yellow and red; you keep the yellow and throw back only the red. But yellow and red together
make orange; so when I throw an orange light, you throw back the red part of it and keep the
yellow.

Now if we suppose that instead of throwing lights to you I throw them to molecules of dye which
are "trained" to throw back the red lights and keep all the other kinds (absorb them and change
them to heat), we can understand what the dye in a red sweater does. The dye is not really
trained, of course, but for a reason which we do not entirely understand, some kinds of dye
always throw back (reflect) any red that is in the light that shines on them, but they keep
all other kinds of light, changing them to heat. Other dyes or coloring matter always throw
back any green that is in the light that shines on them, keeping the other colors. Blue coloring
matter throws back only the blue part of the light, and so on through all the colors.

So if you throw a white light, which contains all the colors, on a "red" sweater, the dye in
the sweater picks out the red part of the white light and throws that back to your eyes (reflects
it to you) but it keeps the rest of the colors of the white light, changing them to heat; and
since only the red part of the light is reflected to your eyes, that is the only part of it
that you can see; so the sweater looks red. The "green" substance (chlorophyll) in grass acts
in the same way; only it throws the green part of the sunlight back to your eyes, keeping the
rest; so the part of the light that reaches you from the grass is the green light, and the
grass looks green.

Anything white, like a piece of paper, reflects all the light that strikes it; so if all the
colors (white light) strike it, all are reflected to your eyes and the object looks white.

You have looked at people under the mercury-vapor lights in photo-postal studios, have you
not? The lights are long, inclined tubes which glow with a greenish-violet light. No matter
how good the color of a person is in ordinary light, in that light it is ghastly.

Go into the kitchen tonight, light a burner of the gas stove, turn out the light and sprinkle
salt on the blue gas flame. The flame will leap up, yellow. Look at your hands, at some one's
lips, at a piece of red cloth, in this light. Does anything look red?

The reason why nothing looks pink or red in these two kinds of light is this: The light given
by glowing salt vapor or mercury vapor has no red in it; if you tried to make a "rainbow" from
it with a prism, you would find no red or orange color in it. A thing looks red when it absorbs
all the parts of the light that are not red and reflects the red light to your eyes. If there
is no red in the light to reflect, obviously a thing cannot look red in that light.

When you look through a piece of colored glass, the case is somewhat different. A piece of
blue glass, for instance, acts as a sort of strainer. The coloring matter in it lets the blue
light through it, but it holds back (absorbs) the other kinds of light. So if you look through
a piece of blue glass you see everything blue; that is, only the blue part of the light from
different objects can reach your eyes through this kind of glass. Anything that is transparent
and colored acts in a similar way.

WHY THE SKY IS BLUE. And that is why the sky looks blue. Air holds back all colors of light
except blue; that is, it holds them back a little. A room full of air holds the colors back
hardly at all. A few miles of air hold them back more; mountains in the distance look bluish
because only the blue light from them can reach you through the air. The hundred or more miles
of air above you hold back a considerable amount of the other colors of light, letting through
much more of blue than of any other color. So the sky looks blue; that is, when the air scatters
the sunlight above you, it is chiefly the blue parts of the sunlight that it allows to reach
your eyes.

WHY BODIES OF WATER LOOK GREEN IN SOME PLACES AND BLUE IN OTHERS. Water acts in a similar way,
but it lets the green light through instead of the blue. A little water holds back (absorbs)
the other colors so slightly that you cannot notice the effect in a glass of water. But in
a swimming tank full of water, or in a lake or an ocean, you can notice it decidedly when you
look straight down into the water itself.

When you look at a smooth body of water at a slant on a clear day, the blue sky is reflected
to you and the water looks blue instead of green. And it may even look blue when you look straight
down in it if it is too deep for you to see the bottom and the sky is reflected from the surface.

WHY THE SKY IS OFTEN RED AT SUNSET. Dust lets more of red and yellow light through than of
any other color, and for this reason there is much red and yellow in the sunset. Just before
the sun sets, it shines through the low, dusty air. The dust filters out most of the light
except the red and yellow. The red light and yellow light are reflected by the clouds (for
the clouds are themselves "white"; that is, they reflect all the colors that strike them),
and you have the beautiful sunset clouds. Sometimes there is a purple in the sunset, and even
green. But since the air itself is blue (that is, it lets mostly blue light go through), it
is easy to see how this blue can combine with the red or yellow that the dust lets through,
to form purple or green.

But we could not have sunset colors or all the colors we see on earth, if it were not that
the sunlight is mostly white--that it contains all colors. And that, too, is why we can have
a rainbow.

HOW RAINBOWS ARE FORMED. You already know fairly well how a rainbow is formed, since you made
an imitation of one with a prism. A rainbow appears in the sky when the sun shines through
the rain; the plain white light of the sun is divided up into red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. As the white light of the sun passes through the raindrops, the violet
part of the light is bent more than any of the rest, the indigo part is bent not quite so much,
and so on to the red, which is bent least of all. So all the colors fan out from the single
beam of white light and form a band of color, which we call the rainbow.

HOW WE CAN TELL WHAT THE SUN AND STARS ARE MADE OF. When a gas or vapor becomes hot enough
to give off light (when it is incandescent), it does not give off white light but light of
different colors. An experiment will let you see this for yourself.

    EXPERIMENT 53. Sprinkle a little copper sulfate (bluestone)
    in the flame of a Bunsen burner. What color does it make the
    flame?

Copper vapor always gives this greenish-blue light when it is heated. The photographer's mercury-vapor
light gave a greenish-violet glow. When you burn salt or soda in a gas flame, you remember
that you get a clear yellow light. By breaking up these lights, somewhat as you broke up the
sunlight with the prism, chemists and astronomers can tell what kind of gas is glowing. The
instrument they use to break up the light into its different colors is called a spectroscope,
and the band of colors formed is called the spectrum. With the spectroscope they examine the
light that comes from the sun and stars and by the colors of the spectra they can tell what
these far-distant bodies are made of.

    APPLICATION 39. If you were going to the tropics, would it
    be better to wear outside clothes that were white or black?

    APPLICATION 40. A dancer was to dance in a spotlight on the
    stage. The light was to change colors constantly. She wanted
    her robe to reflect each color that was thrown on it. Should
    she have worn a robe of red, yellow, white, green, or blue?

    APPLICATION 41. If you looked through a red glass at a
    purple flower (purple is red mixed with blue), would the
    flower look red, blue, purple, black, or white?

    any other color.

CHAPTER SIX

SOUND

SECTION 28. What sound is.

    What makes a dictaphone or a phonograph repeat your words?

    What makes the wind howl when it blows through the branches of
    trees?

    Why can you hear an approaching train better if you put your
    ear to the rail?

If you were to land on the moon tonight, and had with you a tank containing a supply of air
which you could breathe (for there is no air to speak of on the moon), you might try to speak.
But you would find that you had lost your voice completely. You could not say a word. You would
open and close your mouth and not a sound would come.

Then you might try to make a noise by clapping your hands; but that would not work. You could
not make a sound. "Am I deaf and dumb?" you might wonder.

The whole trouble would lie in the fact that the moon has practically no air. And sound is
usually a kind of motion of the air,--hundreds of quick, sharp puffs in a second, so close
together that we cannot feel them with anything less sensitive than the tiny nerves in our ears.

If you can once realize the fact that sound is a series of quick, sharp puffs of air, or to
use a more scientific term, vibrations of air, it will be easy for you to understand most of
the laws of sound.

A phonograph seems almost miraculous. Yet it works on an exceedingly simple principle. When
you talk, the breath passing out of your throat makes the vocal cords vibrate. These and your
tongue and lips make the air in front of you vibrate.

When you talk into a dictaphone horn, the vibrating air causes the needle at the small end
of the horn to vibrate so that it traces a wavy line in the soft wax of the cylinder as the
cylinder turns. Then when you run the needle over the line again it follows the identical track
made when you talked into the horn, and it vibrates back and forth just as at first; this makes
the air in the horn vibrate exactly as when you talked into the horn, and you have the same sound.

All this goes back to the fundamental principle that sound is vibrations of air; different
kinds of sounds are simply different kinds of vibrations. The next experiments will prove this.

    EXPERIMENT 54. Turn the rotator rapidly, holding the corner of
    a piece of stiff paper against the holes in the disk. As
    you turn faster, does the sound become higher or lower? Keep
    turning at a steady rate and move your paper from the inner
    row of holes to the outer row and back again. Which row has
    the most holes in it? Which makes the highest sound? Hold your
    paper against the teeth at the edge of the disk. Is the pitch
    higher or lower than before? Blow through a blowpipe against
    the different rows of holes while the disk is being whirled.
    As the holes make the air vibrate do you get any sound?

This experiment shows that by making the air vibrate you get a sound.

The next experiment will show that when you have sound you are getting vibrations.

    EXPERIMENT 55. Tap a tuning fork against the desk, then
    hold the prongs lightly against your lips. Can you feel them
    vibrate? Tap it again, and hold the fork close to your ear.
    Can you hear the sound?

The experiment which follows will show that we usually must have air to do the vibrating to
carry the sound.

    EXPERIMENT 56. Make a pad of not less than a dozen thicknesses
    of soft cloth so that you can stand an alarm clock on it on
    the plate of the air pump. The pad is to keep the vibrations
    of the alarm from making the plate vibrate. A still better way
    would be to set a tripod on the plate of the air pump and to
    suspend the alarm clock from the tripod by a rubber band. Set
    the alarm so that it will ring in 3 or 4 minutes, put it under
    the bell jar, and pump out the air. Before the alarm goes off,
    be sure that the air is almost completely pumped out of the
    jar. Can you hear the bell ring? Distinguish between a dull
    trilling sound caused by the jarring of the air pump when the
    alarm is on, and the actual ringing sound of the bell.

The experiment just completed shows how we know there would be no sound on the moon, since
there is practically no air around it. The next experiment will show you more about the way
in which phonographs work.

    EXPERIMENT 57. Put a blank cylinder on the dictaphone, adjust
    the recording (cutting) needle and diaphragm at the end of the
    tube, start the motor, and talk into the dictaphone. Shut
    off the motor, remove the cutting needle, and put on the
    reproducing needle (the cutting needle, being sharp, would
    spoil the cylinder). Partly but her have been oriental, "," "b-the

 So, to be accurate, we should say that
sound is vibrations of any kind of matter. And the vibrations travel better in most other kinds
of matter than they do in air. Vibrations move rather slowly in air, compared with the speed
at which they travel in other substances. It takes sound about 5 seconds to go a mile in air;
in other words, it would go 12 miles while an express train went one. But it travels faster
in water and still faster in anything hard like steel. That is why you can hear the noise of
an approaching train better if you put your ear to the rail.

WHY WE SEE STEAM RISE BEFORE WE HEAR A WHISTLE BLOW. But even through steel, sound does not
travel with anything like the speed of light. In the time that it takes sound to go a mile,
light goes hundreds of thousands of miles, easily coming all the way from the moon to the earth.
That is why we see the steam rise from the whistle of a train or a boat before we hear the
sound. The sound and the light start together; but the light that shows us the steam is in
our eyes almost at the instant when the steam leaves the whistle; the sound lags behind, and
we hear it later.

    APPLICATION 42. Explain why a bell rung in a vacuum makes
    no noise; why the clicking of two stones under water sounds
    louder if your head is under water, than the clicking of the
    two stones in the air sounds if your head is in the air; why
    you hear a buzzing sound when a bee or a fly comes near you;
    how a phonograph can reproduce sounds.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    251. The paint on woodwork blisters when hot.

    252. You can screw a nut on a bolt very much tighter with a
    wrench than with your fingers.

    253. When a pipe is being repaired in the basement of a house,
    you can hear a scraping noise in the faucets upstairs.

    254. Sunsets are unusually red after volcanic eruptions.

    255. Thunder shakes a house.

    256. Shooting stars are really stones flying through space.
    When they come near the earth, it pulls them swiftly down
    through the air. Explain why they glow.

    257. At night it is difficult to see out through a closed
    window of a room in which a lamp is lighted.

    258. When there is a breeze you cannot see clear reflections
    in a lake.

    259. Rubbing with coarse sandpaper makes rough wood smooth.

    260. A bow is bent backward to make the arrow go forward.

SECTION 29. Echoes.

    When you put a sea shell to your ear, how is it that you hear
    a roar in the shell?

    Why can you sometimes hear an echo and sometimes not?

If it were not for the fact that sound travels rather slowly, we should have no echoes, for
the sound would get back to us practically at the instant we made it. An echo is merely a sound,
a series of air vibrations, bounced back to us by something at a distance. It takes time for
the vibration which we start to reach the wall or cliff that bounces it back, and it takes
as much more time for the returning vibration to reach our ears. So you have plenty of time
to finish your shout before the sound bounces back again. The next experiment shows pretty
well how the waves, or vibrations, of sound are reflected; only in the experiment we use waves
of water because they go more slowly and we can watch them.

    EXPERIMENT 59. Fill the long laboratory sink (or the bathtub
    at home) half full of water and start a wave from one end.
    Watch it move along the side of the sink. Notice what happens
    when it reaches the other end.

Air waves do the same thing; when they strike against a flat surface, they bounce back like
a rubber ball. If you are far enough away from a flat wall or cliff, and shout, the sound (the
air vibrations you start) is reflected back to you and you hear the echo. But if you are close
to the walls, as in an empty room, the sound reverberates; it bounces back and forth from one
wall to the other so rapidly that no distinct echo is heard, and there is merely a confusion
of sound.

When you drop a pebble in water, the ripples spread in all directions. In the same way, when
you make a sound in the open air, the air waves spread in all directions. But when you shout
through a megaphone the air waves are all concentrated in one direction and consequently they
are much stronger in that direction. However, while the megaphone intensifies sound, the echoing
from the sides of the megaphone makes the sound lose some of its distinctness.

WHY IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND A SPEAKER IN AN EMPTY HALL. A speaker can be heard much more easily
in a room full of people than in an empty hall. The sound does not reflect well from the soft
clothes of the audience and the uneven surfaces of their bodies, just as a rubber ball does
not bounce well in sand. So the sound does not reverberate as in an empty hall.

    APPLICATION 43. Explain why a carpeted room is quieter than
    one with a bare floor; why you shout through your hands when
    you want to be heard at a distance.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    261. It is harder to walk when you shuffle your feet.

    262. The air over a lamp chimney, or over a register in a
    furnace-heated house, is moving upward rapidly.

    263. The shooting of a gun sounds much louder within a room
    than it does outdoors.

    264. A drum makes a loud, clear sound when the tightened head
    is struck.

    265. The pull of the moon causes the ocean tides.

    266. Sand is sometimes put in the bottom of vases to keep them
    from falling over.

    267. It is difficult to understand clearly the words of one
    who is speaking in an almost empty hall.

    268. The ridges in a washboard help to clean the clothes that
    are rubbed over them.

    269. One kind of mechanical toy has a heavy lead wheel inside.
    When you start this to whirling, the toy runs for a long time.

    270. If you raise your finger slightly after touching the
    surface of water, the water comes up with your finger.

SECTION 30. Pitch.

    What makes the keys of a piano give different sounds?

    Why does the moving of your fingers up and down on a violin
    string make it play different notes?

    Why is the whistle of a peanut roaster so shrill, and why is
    the whistle of a boat so deep?

Did you ever notice how tiresome the whistle on a peanut roaster gets? Well, suppose that whenever
you spoke you had to utter your words in exactly that pitch; that every time a car came down
the street its noise was like the whistle of the peanut roaster, only louder; that every step
you took sounded like hitting a bell of the same pitch; that when you went to the moving-picture
theater the orchestra played only the one note; that when any one sang, his voice did not rise
and fall; in short, that all the sounds in the world were in one pitch. That is the way it
would be if different kinds of air vibrations did not make different kinds of notes,--if there
were no differences in pitch.

PITCH DUE TO RAPIDITY OF VIBRATION. When air vibrations are slow,--far apart,--the sound is
low; when they are faster, the sound is higher; when they are very quick indeed, the sound
is very shrill and high. In various ways, as by people talking and walking and by the running
of street cars and automobiles, all sorts of different vibrations are started, giving us a
pleasant variety of high and low and medium pitches in the sounds of the world around us.

An experiment will show how pitch varies and how it is regulated:

    EXPERIMENT 60. Move the slide of an adjustable tuning fork
    well up from the end of the prongs, tap one prong lightly on
    the desk, and listen. Move the slide somewhat toward the
    end of the prongs, and repeat. Is a higher or a lower sound
    produced as the slide shortens the length of the prongs?

    Whistle a low note, then a high one. Notice what you do with
    your lips; when is the opening the smaller? Sing a low note,
    then a high one. When are the cords in your throat looser?
    Fill a drinking glass half full of water, and strike it. Now
    pour half the water out, and strike the glass again. Do you
    get the higher sound when the column of water is shorter or
    when it is longer? Stretch a rubber band across your thumb and
    forefinger. Pick the band as you make it tighter, not making
    it longer, but pulling it tighter with your other fingers.
    Does it make a higher or a lower sound as you increase the
    tightness? Stretch the band from your thumb to your little
    finger and pick it; now put your middle finger under the band
    so as to divide it in halves, and pick it again. Does a short
    strand give a higher or lower pitch than a long strand?

A violinist tunes his violin by tightening the strings; the tighter they are and the thinner
they are, the higher the note they give. Some of the strings are naturally higher than others;
the highest is a smaller, finer string than the lowest. When the violinist plays, he shortens
the strings by holding them down with his fingers, and the shorter he makes them the higher
the note. A bass drum is much larger than a high-pitched kettledrum. The pipes of an organ
are long and large for the low notes, shorter and smaller for the high ones.

In general, the longer or larger the object is that vibrates, the slower the rate of vibration
and consequently the lower the pitch. But the shorter or finer the object is that vibrates,
the higher the rate of vibration and the higher the pitch.

All musical instruments contain devices which can be made to vibrate,--either strings or columns
of air, or other things that swing to and fro and start waves in the air. And by tightening
them, or making them smaller or shorter, the pitch can be made higher; that is, the number
of vibrations to each second can be increased.

    APPLICATION 44. Explain why a steamboat whistle is usually
    of much lower pitch than is a toy whistle; why a banjo player
    moves his fingers toward the drum end of the banjo when he
    plays high notes; why the sound made by a mosquito is higher
    in pitch than that made by a bumblebee.

    APPLICATION 45. A boy had a banjo given him for Christmas.
    He wanted to tune it. To make a string give a higher note,
    should he have tightened or loosened it? Or could he have
    secured the same result by moving his finger up and down the
    string to lengthen or shorten it?

    APPLICATION 46. A man was tuning a piano for a concert. The
    hall was cold, yet he knew it would be warm at the time of the
    concert. Should he have tuned the piano to a higher pitch than
    he wanted it to have on the concert night, to the exact pitch,
    or to a lower pitch?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    271. A cowboy whirls his lasso around and around his head
    before he throws it.

    272. Furnaces are always placed in the basements of buildings,
    never on top floors.

    273. A rather slight contraction of a muscle lifts your arm a
    considerable distance.

    274. A player on a slide trombone changes the pitch of the
    notes by lengthening and shortening the tube while he blows
    through it.

    275. Rain runs off a tar roof in droplets, while on shingles
    it soaks in somewhat and spreads.

    276. There is a sighing sound as the wind blows through the
    branches of trees, or through stretched wires or ropes.

    277. Sometimes a very violent noise breaks the membrane in the
    drum of a person's ear.

    278. As a street car goes faster and faster, the hum of its
    motor is higher and higher.

    279. If a street is partly dry, the wet spots shine more than
    the dry spots do.

    280. Molten type metal, when poured into a mold, becomes hard,
    solid type when it cools.

CHAPTER SEVEN

MAGNETISM AND ELECTRICITY

SECTION 31. Magnets; the compass.

    What makes the needle of a compass point north?

    What causes the Northern Lights?

For many hundreds of years sailors have used the compass to determine directions. During all
this time men have known that one point of the needle always swings toward the north if there
is no iron near to pull it some other way, but until within the past century they did not know
why. Now we have found the explanation in the fact that the earth is a great big magnet. The
experiment which follows will help you to understand why the earth's being a magnet should
make the compass needle point north and south.

    EXPERIMENT 61. Lay a magnetic compass flat on the table.
    Notice which point swings to the north. Now hold a horseshoe
    magnet, points down, over the compass. Turn the magnet around
    and watch the compass needle; see which end of the magnet
    attracts the north point; hold that end of it toward the south
    point and note the effect. Hold the magnet, ends up, under the
    table directly below the compass and turn the magnet, watching
    the compass needle.

The earth is a magnet, and it acts just as your magnet does: one end attracts one point of
the compass, and the other end attracts the other point. That ought to make it clear why the
compass points north. But how is the compass made? The next experiment will show this plainly.

    EXPERIMENT 62. Take a long shoestring and make a loop in one
    end of it. Slip the magnet through the loop and suspend it,
    ends down. Fasten the shoestring to the top of a doorway so
    that the magnet can swing easily. Steady the magnet and let it
    turn until it comes to a rest. Mark the end that swings to the
    north. Turn this end around to the south; let go and watch it.
    Place the magnet the other way around in the loop so that you
    can be sure that it is not twisting of the shoestring that
    makes the magnet turn in this direction.

    Now stroke a needle several times along one arm of the magnet,
    always in the same direction, as shown in Figure 105. Hold
    the needle over some iron filings or touch any bit of iron
    or steel with it. What has the needle become? Lay it on a
    cardboard milk-bottle top of the flat kind, and on that float
    it in the middle of a glass or earthenware dish of water.
    Notice which end turns north. Turn this end to the south and
    see what happens. Hold your magnet, ends up, under the dish,
    and turn the magnet. What does the needle do?

Now it should be easy to understand why the compass points north. One end of any magnet pulls
on one end of another magnet and drives the other end away. The earth is a big magnet. So if
you make a magnet and balance it in such a way that it is free to swing, the north end of the
big earth magnet pulls one end of the little magnet toward it and pushes the other end away.
Therefore one end of your compass always points north.

OTHER EFFECTS OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETISM. Another interesting effect of the earth's being a big
magnet is to be seen if you lay a piece of steel so that it points north and south, and then
pound it on one end. It becomes magnetized just as your needle became magnetized when it was
rubbed on the small magnet.

And still another effect of the earth's magnetism is this: Tiny particles of electricity, called
electrons, are probably shooting through space from the sun. It is believed that as they come
near the earth, the magnetism of the north and south polar regions attracts them toward the
poles, and that as they rush through the thin, dry upper air, they make it glow. And this is
probably what causes the Northern Lights or Aurora Borealis.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A NEEDLE IS MAGNETIZED. The reason that a needle becomes magnetic if it is
rubbed over a magnet is probably this: Every molecule of iron may be an extremely tiny magnet;
if it is, each molecule has a north and south pole like the needle of a compass. In an ordinary
needle (or in any unmagnetized piece of iron or steel) these molecules would be facing every
way, as shown in Figure 107.

But when a piece of steel or iron that is already magnetized is brought near the unmagnetized
needle, all the north poles of the molecules of the needle are pulled in the same direction--it
is almost like combing tangled hair to stroke a needle over a magnet. Then the molecules are
arranged more as shown in Figure 108. When all the molecules, each of which is a tiny magnet,
pull in the same direction, they make a strong magnet, and they magnetize any iron that comes
near them just as they were magnetized.

Steel will stay magnetized a long time; but ordinary soft iron loses magnetism almost as soon
as another magnet is taken away from it,--the molecules become all disarranged again.

In a later section you will find that whenever electricity flows through a wire that is coiled
around a piece of iron, the iron becomes magnetized just as when it is rubbed with a magnet.

    APPLICATION 47. An explorer lost his compass. In clear
    weather he could tell the directions by the sun and stars, but
    in cloudy weather he was badly handicapped. He had with him a
    gun, plenty of ammunition, a sewing kit, a hunting knife, and
    some provisions. How could he have made a compass?

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    281. Snow turns to water in the first warm weather.

    282. A person's face looks ghastly by the greenish light of a
    mercury-vapor lamp.

    283. If a red-hot coal is touched with a cold poker, the coal

    290. Thunder rolls; that is, after the first peal there is a
    reverberating sound that becomes less and less distinct.

SECTION 32. Static electricity.

    What is electricity?

    What makes thunder and lightning?

    Why does the barrel or cap of a fountain pen pick up small
    bits of paper after it has been rubbed on your coat sleeve?

    Why do sparks fly from the fur of a cat when you stroke it in
    the dark?

The Greeks, 2000 years ago, knew that there was such a thing as electricity, and they used
to get it by rubbing amber with silk. In the past century men have learned how to make electricity
do all sorts of useful work: making boats and cars and automobiles go, ringing bells, furnishing
light, and, in the telephone and telegraph, carrying messages. But no one knew what electricity
really was until, within the last 25 years, scientists found out.

ATOMS AND ELECTRONS. When we talked about molecules, we said that they were as much smaller
than a germ as a germ is smaller than a mountain. Well, a molecule is made up, probably, of
some things that are much smaller still,--so small that people thought that nothing could be
smaller. Ii. it. 138.)] It or it conduct of genius like that has dissolved of future; but he

days, they are not needed.
 Scientists know how many trillions of electrons flow through
an incandescent electric lamp in a second and how many quadrillions of them it would take to
weigh as much as a feather. They know what the electrons do when they move, how fast they can
move, and what substances let electrons move through them easily and what substances hold them
back; and they know perfectly well how to set them in motion. How the scientists came to know
all these things you will learn in the study of physics; it is a long story. But you can find
out some things about electrons yourself. The first experiment is a simple one such as the
Greeks used to do with amber.

    EXPERIMENT 63. Rub a hard rubber comb on a piece of woolen
    cloth. The sleeve of a woolen coat or sweater will do. Rub the
    comb quickly in the same direction several times. Now hold it
    over some small bits of paper or sawdust. What does it do
    to them? Hold it over some one's hair. The rest of this
    experiment will work well only on cool, clear days. Rub the
    comb again, a dozen or more times in quick succession. Now
    touch it gently to the lobe of your ear. Do you hear the snap
    as the small spark jumps from the comb to your ear?

    Pull a dry hair out of your head and hold it by one end.
    Charge your comb by rubbing it again, and bring it near the
    loose end of the hair. If the end of the hair clings to the
    comb at first, leave it clinging until it flies off. Now try
    to touch the hair with the comb. Next, pinch the end of the
    hair between your thumb and finger and again bring the
    charged comb near it. Is the hair attracted or repelled? After
    touching the comb what does it do?

    You can get the same effects by rubbing glass or amber on
    silk.

OBJECTS NEGATIVELY AND POSITIVELY CHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY. There are probably electrons in
everything. But when there is just the usual number of electrons in an object, it acts in an
ordinary way and we say that it is not charged with electricity. If there are more than the
usual number of electrons on an object, however, we say that it is negatively charged, or that
it has a negative charge of electricity on it. But if there are fewer electrons than usual
in an object, we say that it has a positive charge of electricity on it, or that it is positively
charged.

You might expect a "negative charge" to indicate fewer electrons than usual, not more. But
people called the charge "negative" long before they knew anything about electrons; and it
is easier to keep the old name than to change all the books that have been written about electricity.
So we still call a charge "negative" when there are unusually many electrons, and we call it
"positive" when there are unusually few. A negative charge means that more electrons are present
than usual. A positive charge means that fewer electrons are present than usual.

Before you rubbed your comb on wool, neither the comb nor the wool was charged; both had just
the usual number of electrons. But when you rubbed them together, you rubbed some of the electrons
off the wool on to the comb. Then the comb had a negative charge; that is, it had too many
electrons--too many little particles of electricity.

When you brought the comb near the hair, the hair had fewer electrons than the comb. Whenever
one object has more electrons on it than another, the two objects are pulled toward each other;
so there was an attraction between the comb and the hair, and the hair came over to the comb.
As soon as it touched the comb, some of the extra electrons jumped from the comb to the hair.
The electrons could not get off the hair easily, so they stayed there. Electrons repel each
other--drive each other away. So when you had a number of electrons on the end of the comb
and a number on the end of the hair, they pushed each other away, and the hair flew from the
comb. But when you pinched the hair, the electrons could get off it to your moist hand, which
lets electricity through it fairly easily. Then the comb had extra electrons on it and the
hair did not; so the comb pulled the hair over toward it again.

When you brought the charged comb near your ear, some of the electrons on the comb pushed the
others off to your ear, and you heard them snap as they rushed through the air, making it vibrate.

HOW LIGHTNING AND THUNDER ARE CAUSED. In thunderstorms the strong currents of rising air blow
some of the forming raindrops in the clouds into bits of spray. The tinier droplets get more
than their share of electrons when this happens and are carried on up to higher clouds. In
this way clouds become charged with electricity. One cloud has on it many more electrons than
another cloud that is made, perhaps, of lower, larger droplets. The electricity leaps from
the cloud that has the greater number of electrons to the cloud that has the less number, or
it leaps from the heavily charged cloud down to a tree or house or the ground. You see the
electricity leap and call it lightning. Much more leaps, however, than leaped from the comb
to your ear, and so it makes a very much louder snap. The snap is caused in this way: As the
electric spark leaps through the air, it leaves an empty space or vacuum immediately behind
it. The air from all sides rushes into the vacuum and collides there; then it bounces back.
This again leaves a partial vacuum; so the air rushes in once more, coming from all sides at
once, and again bounces back. This starts the air vibrations which we call sound. Then the
sound is echoed from cloud to cloud and from the clouds to the earth and back again, and we
call it thunder.

The electricity you have been reading about and experimenting with in this section is called
static electricity. "Static" means standing still. The electricity you rubbed up to the surface
of the comb or glass stayed still until it jumped to the bit of paper or hair; then it stayed
still on that. This was the only kind of electricity most people knew anything about until
the nineteenth century; and it is not of any great use. Electricity must be flowing through
things to do work. That is why people could not invent electric cars and electric lights and
telephones before they knew how to make electricity flow steadily rather than just to stand
still on one thing until it jumped across to another and stood there. In the next chapter we
shall take up the ways in which electrons are made to flow and to do work.

    APPLICATION 48. Explain why the stroking of a cat's back
    will sometimes cause sparks and make the cat's hairs stand
    apart; why combing sometimes makes your hairs fly apart. Both
    of these effects are best secured on a dry day, because on a
    damp day the water particles in the air will let the electrons
    pass to them as fast as they are rubbed up to the surface of
    the hair.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    291. If you shuffle your feet on a carpet in clear, cold
    weather and then touch a person's nose or ear, a slight spark
    passes from your finger and stings him.

    292. If you stay out in the cold long, you get chilled
    through.

    293. The air and earth in a greenhouse are warmed by the sun
    through the glass even when it is cold outside and when the
    glass itself remains cold.

CHAPTER EIGHT

ELECTRICITY

SECTION 33. Making electricity flow.

    What causes a battery to produce electricity?

    What makes electricity come into our houses?

The kind of electricity you get from rubbing (friction) is not of much practical use, you remember.
Men had to find a way to get a steady current of electricity before they could make electricity
do any work for them. The difference between static electricity--when it leaps from one thing
to another--and flowing electricity is a good deal like the difference between a short shower
of rain and a river. Both rain and river are water, and the water of each is moving from one
place to another; but you cannot get the raindrops to make any really practical machine go,
while the rivers can do real work by turning the wheels in factories and mills.

Within the past century two devices for making electricity flow and do work have been perfected:
One of these is the electric battery; the other is the dynamo.

THE ELECTRIC BATTERY. A battery consists of two pieces of different kinds of metal, or a metal
and some carbon, in a chemical solution. If you hang a piece of zinc and a carbon, such as
comes from an arc light, in some water, and then dissolve sal ammoniac in the water, you will
have a battery. Some of the molecules of the sal ammoniac divide into two parts when the sal
ammoniac gets into the water, and the molecules continue to divide as long as the battery is
in use or until it "wears out." One part of each molecule has an unusually large number of
electrons; the other part has unusually few. The parts with unusually large numbers of electrons
gather around the zinc; so the zinc is negatively charged,--it has more than the ordinary number
of electrons. The part of the sal ammoniac with unusually few electrons goes over to the carbon;
so the carbon is positively charged,--it has fewer than the ordinary number of electrons.

MAKING THE CURRENT FLOW. Now if we can make some kind of bridge between the carbon and the
zinc, the electrons will flow from the place where there are many to the place where there
are few. Electrons can flow through copper wire very easily. So if we fasten one end of the
copper wire to the carbon and the other end to the zinc, the electrons will flow from the zinc
to the carbon as long as there are more electrons on the zinc; that is, until the battery wears
out. Therefore we have a steady flow of electricity through the wire. While the electricity
is flowing from one pole to the other, we can make it do work.

    EXPERIMENT 64. Set up two or three Samson cells. They consist
    of a glass jar, an open zinc cylinder, and a smaller carbon
    cylinder. Dissolve a little over half a cup of sal ammoniac
    in water and put it into the glass jar; then fill the jar with
    water up to the line that is marked on it. Put the carbon and
    zinc which are attached to the black jar cover into the jar.
    Be careful not to let the carbon touch the zinc. One of these
    cells will probably not be strong enough to ring a doorbell
    for you; so connect two or three together in series as
    follows:

    Fasten a piece of copper wire from the carbon of the first
    cell to the zinc of the second. If you have three cells,
    fasten another piece of wire from the carbon of the second
    cell to the zinc of the third, as shown in Figure 111.

    Fasten one end of a copper wire to the zinc of the first
    cell and the other end of this wire to one binding post of an
    electric bell. Fasten one end of another piece of copper wire
    to the carbon of the third cell, if you have three, and touch
    the other end of this wire to the free binding post of the
    electric bell. If you have everything connected rightly, the
    bell should ring.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF BATTERIES. There are many different kinds of batteries. The one you have
just made is a simple one frequently used for doorbells. Needle. Xvii. one.] and it went then by Titus,

but better almost do it made it. Ix.
 Then the electricity flows from one pole
to the other.

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLES. Before people knew anything about electrons, they knew that electricity
flowed from one pole of a battery to the other. But they always said that it flowed from the
carbon to the zinc; and they called the carbon the positive pole and the zinc the negative.
Although we now know that the electrons flow from the zinc to the carbon, it is much more convenient
to use the old way of speaking, as was explained on page 199. Practically, it makes no difference
which way the electrons are going as long as a current of electricity is flowing through the
wire from one pole of the battery to the other pole. So every one speaks of electricity as
flowing from the positive pole of a battery (usually the carbon or copper) to the negative
pole (usually the zinc), although the electrons actually move in the other direction.

Batteries make enough electricity flow to do a good deal of work. But they are rather expensive,
and it takes a great many to give a flow of electricity sufficient for really heavy work, such
as running street cars or lighting a city. Fortunately there is another way of getting large
amounts of electricity to flow. This is by means of dynamos.

HOW A DYNAMO MAKES A CURRENT FLOW. To understand a dynamo, you must first realize that there
are countless electrons in the world--perhaps all things are made entirely of them. But you
remember that when we want to get these electrons to do work we must make them flow. This can
be done by spinning a loop of wire between the poles of a magnet. Whenever a loop of wire is
turned between the two poles of a magnet, the magnetism pushes the electrons that are already
in the wire around and around the loop. As long as we keep the loop spinning, a current of
electricity flows.

If only one loop of wire is spun between the poles of a magnet, the current is very feeble.
If you loop the wire around twice, as shown in Figure 114, the magnet acts on twice as much
of the wire at the same time; so the current is stronger. If a very long piece of wire is used
and is looped around many times, and the whole coil is spun rapidly between the poles of a
powerful magnet, myriads of the electrons in the wire rush around and around the loops--a powerful
current of electricity flows through the wire.

Now suppose you bring one loop of the long wire out, as shown in Figure 115, and suppose you
spin the rest of the loops between the poles of the magnet. Then, to flow through the loops
by the magnet the electricity will have to go clear out through the long loop and back again.
While it is flowing through this long loop, we can make it work. We can cut the long loop and
attach one broken end to one part of an electric lamp and the other end to the other part,
so that the electricity has to flow through the lamp in order to get back to the spinning coil
of wire, as shown in Figure 116. Such an arrangement as this is really an extremely simple dynamo.

You could make a dynamo that would actually work, by arranging such an apparatus so that the
coil would spin between the poles of the magnet. But of course the big commercial dynamos are
very much more complicated in their construction. Figure 116 shows only the general principle
on which they work. The main point to note is that by spinning a coil of wire between the poles
of a magnet, you can make electricity flow rapidly through the wire. And it is in this way
that most of the electricity we use is made.

The power spinning the coil of wire is sometimes steam, and sometimes gasoline or distillate;
and water power is very often used. A large amount of our electricity comes from places where
there are waterfalls. Niagara, for instance, turns great dynamos and generates an enormous
amount of electricity.

WHY MANY AUTOMOBILES HAVE TO BE CRANKED. In an automobile, the magneto is a little dynamo that
makes the sparks which explode the gasoline. While the automobile is going the engine spins
the coil of wire between the magnets, but at starting you have to spin the coil yourself; and
doing that is called "cranking" the automobile. "Self-starters" have a battery and motor to
spin the coil for you until the engine begins to go; then the engine turns the coil of the magneto.

HOW OLD-FASHIONED TELEPHONES ARE RUNG. The old-fashioned telephones, still often used in the
country, have little cranks that you turn to ring for central. The crank turns a coil of wire
between the poles of the magnet and generates the electricity for ringing the bell. These little
dynamos, like those in automobiles, are usually called magnetos.

ALTERNATING CURRENT. For the sake of simplicity and convenience we speak of electricity as
always flowing in through one wire and out through the other. With batteries this is actually
the case. It is also the case where people have what is called direct-current (d. c.) electricity.
But it is easier to raise and lower the voltage (pressure) of the current if instead of being
direct it is alternating; that is, if for one instant the electricity flows in through one
wire and out through the other, the next instant flowing the opposite way, then the first way
again, and so on. This kind of current is called alternating current (a. c.), because the current
alternates, coming in the upper wire and out of the lower for a fraction of a second; then
coming in the lower and out of the upper for the next fraction of a second; then coming in
the upper again and out of the lower for a fraction of a second; and so on, back and forth,
all the time. For heating and lighting, this alternating current is just as good as the direct
current, and it is probably what you have in your own home. For charging storage batteries
and making electromagnets, separating water into two gases, and for running certain kinds of
motors, however, the direct current is necessary. Find out whether the current in your laboratory
is direct or alternating.

    APPLICATION 49. Explain why we need fuel or water to
    generate large currents of electricity; how we can get small
    amounts of electricity to flow without using dynamos; why
    automobiles must be cranked unless they have batteries to
    start them.

INFERENCE EXERCISE

    Explain the following:

    301. Mexican water jars are made of porous clay; the water
    that seeps through keeps the water inside cool.

    302. When you crank an automobile, electricity is generated.

    303. Potatoes will not cook any more quickly in water that is
    boiling violently than in water that is boiling gently.

    304. When you brush your hair on a winter morning, it
    sometimes stands up and flies apart more and more as you
    continue to brush it.

    305. You cannot see a person clearly through a ground-glass
    window, although it lets most of the light through.

    306. There is a layer of coarse, light-colored gravel over
    the tar on roofs, to keep the tar from melting.

    307. It is very easy to slip on a well-waxed hardwood floor.

    308. If you have a silver filling in one of your teeth and
    you touch the filling with a fork or spoon, you get a slight
    shock.

    309. You can shake a thing down into a bottle when it will not
    slip down by itself.

    310. If you rub a needle across one pole of a magnet three or
    four times in the same direction, then float it on a cork in
    water one end of the needle will point north.

SECTION 34. Conduction of electricity.

    How does electricity travel?

    Why do you get a shock if your hands are wet when you touch a
    live wire?

If you were to use a piece of string instead of a copper wire to go from one pole of a battery
to another or to spin between the poles of the magnet of the dynamo, you could get no flow
of electricity to speak of. Electrons do not flow through string easily, but they flow through
a copper wire very easily. Anything that carries, or conducts, electricity well is called a
good conductor. Anything that carries it poorly is called a poor conductor. Anything that allows
practically no electricity to pass through it is called an insulator.

    EXPERIMENT 65.[5] Turn on an electric lamp. Turn it off by
    opening the knife switch. Cover the blade of the knife switch
    with a fold of paper and close it. Will the lamp glow? Try a
    fold of dry cloth; a fold of the same cloth wet. Connect the
    blade to the slot with a piece of iron; with a piece of glass;
    with porcelain; with rubber; with dry wood; with wood that is
    soaking wet; with a coin. Which of these are good conductors
    of electricity? Which could be used as insulators?

[Footnote 5: Read footnote, page 226, before doing this experiment.]

HOW YOU CAN GET AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK. A person's body is not a very good conductor of electricity,
but will conduct it somewhat. When electricity goes through your body, you get a shock. The
shock from the ordinary current of electricity, 110 volts, is not enough to injure you at all;
in fact, if you were standing on dry wood, it would be safe, although you would get a slight
shock, to connect the blade of a knife switch to the slot of the switch, through your hand
or body. Your body would not allow enough current to pass through it to light the lamp. Stronger
currents, like those of power lines and even trolley wires, are extremely dangerous.

All the electric wires entering your house are made of copper. They are all covered with cloth
and rubber and are fastened with glass or porcelain knobs. The reason is simple: Copper and
practically all other metals are very good conductors of electricity; that is, they allow electricity
to pass through them very easily. Cloth, rubber, glass, and porcelain are very poor conductors,
and they are therefore used as insulators,--to keep the electricity from going where you do
not want it to go.

    EXPERIMENT 66. To each binding post of an electric bell fasten
    a piece of insulated copper wire with bare ends and at least 4
    feet long. Connect the free end of one of these wires with one
    pole of a battery, using a regular laboratory battery or one
    you made yourself. Attach one end of another piece of wire
    a foot or so long, with bare ends, to the other pole of the
    battery. Touch the free end of this short wire to the free end
    of the long wire, as shown in Figure 120. Does the bell ring?
    If it does not, something is wrong with the connection or with
    the battery; fix them so that the bell will ring. Now leave a
    gap of about an inch between the free end of the long wire
    and the free end of the short wire. Try making the electricity
    flow from the short wire into the long one through a number of
    different things, such as string, a key, a knife, a piece of
    glass tubing, wet cloth, dry cloth, rubber, paper, a nail,
    a dish of mercury (dip the ends of the wire into the dish so
    that they both touch the mercury at the same time), a dish of
    water, a stone, a pail, a pin, and anything else that you may
    like to try.

Each thing that makes the bell ring is a good conductor. In this worship arose the schools of the Minnesingers
and the Troubadours, who paid her tube from the sharpness of these feather song. Under the instrumentality
could do she came the arbiter of all knightly disputes, the queen of
whom wholly truckling was due scientists.

The water and wet cloth did not ring the bell, but this is because the pressure or voltage
of the electricity in the batteries is not very high. In dealing with high-power wires it is
much safer to consider water, or anything wet, as a pretty good conductor of electricity. Absolutely
pure, distilled water is an extremely poor conductor; but most water has enough minerals dissolved
in it to make it conduct electricity fairly well. In your list you had better put water and
wet things in the column with the good conductors.

    APPLICATION 50. Robbers had cut the telegraph line between two
    railroad stations (Fig. 122). The broken ends of the wire fell to
    the ground, a number of feet apart. A farmer caught sight of the men
    speeding away in an automobile and he saw the cut wires on the
    ground. He guessed that they had some evil purpose and decided to
    repair the damage. He could not bring the two ends of the wire
    together. He ran to his barn and found the following things there:

    A ball of cord, a pickax, a crowbar, some harness, a wooden wagon
    tongue, a whip, a piece of iron wire around a bale of hay (the wire
    was not long enough to stretch the whole distance between the two
    ends of the telegraph wire, even if you think he might have used it
    to patch the gap), a barrel with four iron hoops, and a rope.

    Which of these things could he have made use of in connecting the
    broken ends of the telegraph wire?

    APPLICATION 51. A man was about to put in a new socket for an
    electric lamp in his home. He did not want to turn off the current
    for the whole house, as it was night and there was no gas to furnish
    light while he worked.

    "I've heard that if you keep your hands wet while you work, the film
    of water on them will keep you from getting a shock," his wife said.

    "Don't you wet your hands, Father," said his 12-year-old boy; "keep
    them dry, and handle the wires with your pliers, so that you won't
    have to touch it."

    "I advise you to put on your canvas gloves while you work; then you
    can't get a shock," added another member of the family.

    "That's a good idea," said the wife, "but wet the gloves, then you
    will have the double protection of the water and the cloth."

    The man laughed and went to work on the socket. He did not get a
    shock. Which advice, if any, do you think he followed?

    319. Diamonds flash many colors.

    320. In swimming, if you have hold of a fastened rope and try
    to pull it toward you, you go toward it.

SECTION 35. Complete circuits.

    Why does a doorbell ring when you push a button?

    Why is it that when you touch one electric wire you feel no
    shock, while if you touch two wires you sometimes get a shock?

    When a wire is broken in an electric light, why does it not
    light?

Suppose you have some water in an open circular trough like the one shown in Figure 123. Then
suppose you have a paddle and keep pushing the water to your right from one point. The water
you push pushes the water next to it, that pushes the water next to it, and so on all around
the trough until the water just behind your paddle pushes in toward the paddle; the water goes
around and around the trough in a complete circuit. There never is too much water in one place;
you never run out of water. But then suppose a partition is put across the trough somewhere
along the circuit. When the water reaches that, it cannot pass; it has no place to flow to,
and the current of water stops.

THE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT. The flow of electricity in an electric circuit may be compared to the
flow of the water in the tank we have been imagining. The long loop of wire extending out from
the dynamo to your house and back again corresponds to the tank. The electricity corresponds
to the water. Your dynamo pushes the electricity around and around the circuit, as the paddle
pushes the water. But let some one break the circuit by putting a partition between two parts
of it, and the electricity immediately stops flowing. One of the most effective partitions
we can put into an electric circuit is a gap of air. It is very difficult for any electricity
to flow through the air; so if we simply cut the wire in two, electricity can no longer flow
from one part to the other, and the current is broken.

BREAKING AND MAKING THE CIRCUIT. The most convenient way to put an air partition into an electric
circuit and so to break it, or to close the circuit again so it will be complete, is to use
a switch.

    EXPERIMENT 67. In the laboratory, examine the three different
    kinds of switches where the electricity flows into the lamp
    and resistance wire and then out again. Trace the path the
    electricity must take from the wire coming into the building
    down to the first switch that it meets; then from one end
    of the wire through the brass or copper to which the wire is
    screwed, through the switch and on out into the end of the
    next piece of wire. Turn the first switch off and see how
    a partition of air is made between the place where the
    electricity comes in and the place where it would get out if
    it could. Turn the switch on and notice how this gives the
    electricity a complete path through to the next piece of wire.
    In this way follow the circuit on through all the switches to
    the electric lamp.

If you examine the socket into which the lamp screws and examine the lamp itself, you will
see that electricity which goes to the outer part of the socket passes into the rim of the
lamp; from here it goes into one end of the filament. It passes through the filament to the
other end, which is connected to the little brass disk at the end of the lamp. From this you
can see that it goes into the center point of the socket, and then on into the second wire
that connects to the socket. Trace the current on back through this other wire until you see
where this wire leads toward the dynamo. You should understand that the electric lamp, the
switches, the fuses, all things along the circuit, are simply parts of the long loop from the
dynamo, as shown in Figure 124.

CONNECTING IN PARALLEL. The trouble with Figure 124 is that it is a little too simple. From
looking at it you might think that the loop entered only one building. And it might seem that
turning off one switch would shut off the electricity all along the line. It would, too, if
the circuit were arranged exactly as shown above. To avoid this, and for other reasons, the
main loop from the dynamo has branches so that the electricity can go through any or all of
them at the same time and so that shutting off one branch will not affect the others. Shall not see it behold

 As there diagrammed, the electricity passes
out from the dynamo along the lower wire and goes down the left-hand wire of circuit A through
one of the electric lamps that is turned on, and then it goes back through the right-hand wire
of the A circuit to the upper wire of the main circuit and then on back to the dynamo. But
only a part of the electricity goes through the A circuit; part goes on to the B circuit, and
there it passes partly through the electric iron. Then it goes back through the other wire
to the dynamo. No electricity can get through the electric lamp on the B circuit, because the
switch to the lamp is open. The switch on the C circuit is open; so no electricity can pass
through it.
