CHAPTER I. A Cat Can Do More than Look at a King

It was long ago in the days when men sighed when they fell in love; when people danced by candle
and lamp, and did dance, too, instead of solemnly gliding about; in that mellow time so long
ago, when the young were romantic and summer was roses and wine, old Carewe brought his lovely
daughter home from the convent to wreck the hearts of the youth of Rouen.

That was not a far journey; only an afternoon's drive through the woods and by the river, in
an April, long ago; Miss Betty's harp carefully strapped behind the great lumbering carriage,
her guitar on the front seat, half-buried under a mound of bouquets and oddly shaped little
bundles, farewell gifts of her comrades and the good Sisters. In her left hand she clutched
a small lace handkerchief, with which she now and then touched her eyes, brimmed with the parting
from Sister Cecilia, Sister Mary Bazilede, the old stone steps and all the girls: but for every
time that she lifted the dainty kerchief to brush away the edge of a tear, she took a deep
breath of the Western woodland air and smiled at least twice; for the years of strict inclosure
within St. Mary's walls and still gardens were finished and done with, and at last the many-colored
world flashed and danced in a mystery before her. This mystery was brilliant to the convent-girl
because it contained men; she was eager to behold it.

They rumbled into town after sunset, in the fair twilight, the dogs barking before them, and
everyone would have been surprised to know that Tom Vanrevel, instead of Mr. Crailey Gray,
was the first to see her. By the merest accident, Tom was strolling near the Carewe place at
the time; and when the carriage swung into the gates, with rattle and clink and clouds of dust
at the finish, it was not too soon lost behind the shrubbery and trees for Tom to catch something
more than a glimpse of a gray skirt behind a mound of flowers, and of a charming face with
parted lips and dark eyes beneath the scuttle of an enormous bonnet. It happened--perhaps it
is more accurate to say that Tom thought it happened--that she was just clearing away her veil
when he turned to look. She blushed suddenly, so much was not to be mistaken; and the eyes
that met his were remarkable for other reasons than the sheer loveliness of them, in that,
even in the one flash of them he caught, they meant so many things at one time. They were sparkling,
yet mournful; and they were wistful, although undeniably lively with the gayest comprehension
of the recipient of their glance, seeming to say, "Oh, it's you, young man, is it!" And they
were shy and mysterious with youth, full of that wonder at the world which has the appearance,
sometimes, of wisdom gathered in the unknown out of which we came. But, above all, these eyes
were fully conscious of Tom Vanrevel.

Without realizing what he did, Mr. Vanrevel stopped short. He had been swinging a walkingstick,
which, describing a brief arc, remained poised half-way in its descent. There was only that
one glance between them; and the carriage disappeared, leaving a scent of spring flowers in
the air.

The young man was left standing on the wooden pavement in the midst of a great loneliness,
yet enveloped in the afterglow, his soul roseate, his being quavering, his expression, like
his cane, instantaneously arrested. With such promptitude and finish was he disposed of, that,
had Miss Carewe been aware of his name and the condition wrought in him by the single stroke,
she could have sought only the terse Richard of England for a like executive ability, "Off
with his head! So much for Vanrevel!"

She had lifted a slender hand to the fluttering veil, a hand in a white glove with a small
lace gauntlet at the wrist. This gesture was the final divinity of the radiant vision which
remained with the dazed young man as he went down the street; and it may have been three-quarters
of an hour later when the background of the picture became vivid to him: a carefully dressed
gentleman with heavy brows and a handsome high nose, who sat stiffly upright beside the girl,
his very bright eyes quite as conscious of the stricken pedestrian as were hers, vastly different,
however, in this: that they glittered, nay, almost bristled, with hostility; while every polished
button of his blue coat seemed to reflect their malignancy, and to dart little echoing shafts
of venom at Mr. Vanrevel.

Tom was dismayed by the acuteness of his perception that a man who does not speak to you has
no right to have a daughter like the lady in the carriage; and, the moment of this realization
occurring as he sat making a poor pretence to eat his evening meal at the "Rouen House," he
dropped his fork rattling upon his plate and leaned back, staring at nothing, a proceeding
of which his table-mate, Mr. William Cummings, the editor of the Rouen Journal, was too busy
over his river bass to take note.

 The cupola, rising above
the library, overlooked the garden; and the house, save for that, was of a single story, with
a low veranda running the length of its front. The windows of the library and of a row of bedrooms---one
of which was Miss Betty's--lined the veranda, "steamboat fashion;" the inner doors of these
rooms all opening upon a long hail which bisected the house, the stairway leading to the room
in the cupola rose the library itself, while the bisecting hail afforded be only access to
the library; hence, the gossips, 'eli acquainted with the geography of the place, conferred
seriously together upon what effect Miss Betty's homecoming would have in this connection:

Dr anyone going to the stairway must needs pass her door; and, what was more to the point,
a party C gentlemen descending late from the mysterious garret might be not so quiet as they
intended, and the young lady sufficiently disturbed to inquire of her father what entertainment
he provided that should keep his guests until four in the morning.

But at present it was with the opposite end of the house that the town was occupied, for there,
workmen were hammering and sawing and painting day long, finishing the addition Mr. Carewe
was building for his daughter's debut. This hammering disturbed Miss Betty, who had become
almost as busy with the French Revolution as with her mantua-maker. For she had found in her
father's library many books not for convent-shelves; and she had become a Girondin. She found
memoirs, histories, and tales of that delectable period, then not so dim with time but that
the figures of it were more than tragic shadows; and for a week there was no meal in that house
to which she sat down earlier than half an hour Jate. She had a rightful property-interest
in the Revolution, her own great-uncle having been one of those who "suffered;" not, however,
under the guillotine; for to Georges Meilhac appertained the rare distinction of death by accident
on the day when the business-like young Bonaparte played upon the mob with his cannon.

There were some yellow letters of this great uncle's in a box which had belonged to her grandmother,
a rich discovery for Miss Betty, who read and re-read them with eager and excited eyes, living
more in Paris with Georges and his friends than in Rouen with her father. Indeed, she had little
else to do. Mr. Carewe was no comrade for her, by far the reverse. She seldom saw him, except
at the table, when he sat with averted eyes, and talked to her very little; and, while making
elaborate preparation for her introduction to his friends (such was his phrase) he treated
her with a perfunctory civility which made her wonder if her advent was altogether welcome
to him; bat when she noticed that his hair looked darker than usual about every fourth day,
she began to understand Why he appeared ungrateful to her for growing up. He went out a great
deal, though no visitors came to the house; for it was known that Mr. Carewe desired to present
his daughter to no one until he presented her to all. Fanchon Bareaud, indeed, made one hurried
and embarrassed call, evading Miss Betty's reference to the chevalier of the kitten with a
dexterity too nimble to be thought unintentional. Miss Carewe was forbidden to return her friend's
visit until after her debut; and Mr. Carewe explained that there was always some worthless
Young men hanging about the Bareaud's, where (he did not add) they interfered with a worthy
oh one who desired to honor Fanchon's older sister, Virginia, with his attentions.

This was no great hardship for Miss Betty, as, since plunging into the Revolution with her
great-uncle, she had lost some curiosity concerning the men of to-day, doubting that they would
show forth as heroic, as debonnair, gay and tragic as he. He was the legendary hero of her
childhood; she remembered her mother's stories of him perhaps more clearly than she remembered
her mother; and one of the older Sisters had known him in Paris and had talked of him at length,
giving the flavor of his dandyism and his beauty at first hand to his young relative. He had
been one of those hardy young men wearing unbelievable garments, who began to appear in the
garden of the Tuileries with knives in their sleeves and cudgels in their hands, about April,
1794, and whose dash and recklessness in many matters were the first intimations that the Citizen
Tallien was about to cause the Citizen Robespierre to shoot himself through the jaw.

In the library hung a small, full-length drawing of Georges, done in color by Miss Betty's
grandmother; and this she carried to her own room an& studied long and ardently, until sometimes
the man himself seemed to stand before her, in spite of the fact that Mile. Meithac had not
a distinguished talent and M. Meilhac's features might have been anybody's. It was to be seen,
however, that he was smiling.

Miss Betty had an impression that her grandmother's art of portraiture would have been more-successful
with the profile than the "full-face." Nevertheless, nothing could be more clearly indicated
than that the hair of M. Melihac was very yellow, and his short, huge-lapelled waistcoat white,
striped with scarlet. An enormous cravat covered his chin; the heavy collar of his yellow coat
rose behind his ears, while its tails fell to his ankles; and the tight trousers of white and
yellow stripes were tied with white ribbons about the middle of the calf; he wore white stockings
and gold-buckled yellow shoes, and on the back of his head a jauntily cocked black hat. Miss
Betty innocently wondered why his letters did not speak of Petion, of Vergniaud, or of Dumoriez,
since in the historical novels which she read, the hero's lot was inevitably linked with that
of everyone of importance in his generation; yet Georges appeared to have been unacquainted
with these personages, Robespierre being the only name of consequence mentioned in his letters;
and then it appeared in much the same fashion practised by her father in alluding to the Governor
of the State, who had the misfortune to be unpopular with Mr. Carewe. But this did not dim
her great-uncle's lustre in Miss Betty's eyes, nor lessen for her the pathetic romance of the
smile he wore.

Beholding this smile, one remembered the end to which his light footsteps bad led him; and
it was unavoidable to picture him left lying in the empty street behind the heels of the flying
crowd, carefully forming that same smile on his lips, and taking much pride in passing with
some small, cynical speech, murmured to himself, concerning the futility of a gentleman's getting
shot by his friends for merely being present to applaud them. So, fancying him thus, with his
yellow hair, his scarlet-striped waistcoat, and his tragedy, the young girl felt a share of
family greatness, or, at least, of picturesqueness, descend to her. And she smiled sadly back
upon the smile in the picture, and dreamed about its original night after night.

Whether or no another figure, that of a dark young man in a white hat, with a white kitten
etching his wrist in red, found any place in her dreams at this period,--it is impossible to
determine. She did not see him again. It is quite another thing, hazardous to venture, to state
that he did not see her. At all events, it is certain that many people who bad never beheld
her were talking of her; that Rouen was full of contention concerning her beauty and her gift
of music, for a song can be heard through an open window. And how did it happen that Crailey
Gray knew that it was Miss Carewe's habit to stroll in her garden for half an hour or so, each
evening before retiring, and that she went to mass every morning soon after sunrise? Crailey
Gray never rose at, or near, sunrise in his life, though he sometimes beheld it, from another
point of view, as the end of the evening. It appears that someone must have told him.

One night when the moon lay white on the trees and housetops, Miss Betty paused in her evening
promenade and seated herself upon a bench on the borders of the garden, "touched," as the books
of the time would have put it, "by the sweet tranquillity of the scene," and wrought upon by
the tender incentive to sighs and melancholy which youth in loneliness finds in a loveliness
of the earth. The breeze bore the smells of the old-fashioned garden, of violets and cherry
blossoms, and a sound of distant violins came on the air playing the new song from the new opera.

     "But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,
     That you loved me just the same--"

they sang; and with the lilt of them and the keen beauty of the night, the inherited pain of
the ages rose from the depths of the young girl's heart, so that she thought it must break;
for what reason she could not have told, since she was without care or sorrow that she knew,
except the French Revolution, yet tears shone upon the long lashes. She shook them off and
looked up with a sudden odd consciousness. The next second she sprang to her feet with a gasp
and a choked outcry, her bands pressed to her breast.

Ten paces in front of her, a gap in the shrubbery where tall trees rose left a small radiant
area of illumination like that of a lime-light in a theatre, its brilliancy intensified by
the dark foliage behind. It was open to view only from the bench by which she stood, and appeared,
indeed, like the stage of a little theatre a stage occupied by a bizarre figure. For, in the
centre of this shining patch, with the light strong on his face, was standing a fair-haired
young man, dressed in a yellow coat, a scarlet and white striped waistcoat, wearing a jauntily
cocked black hat on his bead. And even to the last detail, the ribbon laces above the ankle
and the gold-buckled shoes, he was the sketch of Georges Meilhac sprung into life.

About this slender figure there hung a wan sweetness like a fine mist, almost an ethereality
in that light; yet in the pale face lurked something reckless, something of the actor, too;
and though his smile was gentle and wistful, there was a twinkle behind it, not seen at first,
something amused and impish; a small surprise underneath, like a flea in a rose-jar.

Fixed to the spot by this apparition, Miss Betty stood wildly staring, her straining eyelids
showing the white above and below the large brown iris. Her breath came faster and deeper,
until, between her parted lips it became vocal in a quick sound like a sob. At that he spoke.

"Forgive me!" The voice was low, vibrant, and so exceedingly musical that he might have been
accused of coolly selecting his best tone; and it became only sweeter when, even more softly,
in a semi-whisper of almost crucial pleading, he said, "Ah--don't go away!"

In truth, she could not go; she had been too vitally stirred; she began to tremble excessively,
and sank back upon the bench, motioning him away with vague gestures of her shaking hands.

This was more than the Incroyable had counted upon, and far from his desires. He started forward
with an exclamation.

"Don't come near me!" she gasped. "Who are you? Go away!"

"Give me one second to explain," he began; but with the instant reassurance of this beginning
she cut him off short, her fears dispelled by his commonplace. Nay, indignation displaced them
so quickly that she fairly flashed up before him to her full height.

"You did not come in by the gate!" she cried. "What do you mean by coming here in that dress
What right have you in my garden?"

"Just one word," he begged quickly, but very gently. "You'd allow a street-beggar that much!"

She stood before him, panting, and, as he thought, glorious, in her flush of youth and anger.
Tom Vanrevel had painted her incoherently, but richly, in spite of that, his whole heart being
in the portrait; and--Crailey Gray had smiled at what he deemed the exaggeration of an ordinarily
unimpressionable man who had fallen in love "at first sight;" yet, in the presence of the reality,
the Incroyable decided that Tom's colors had been gray and humble. It was not that she was
merely lovely, that her nose was straight, and her chin dexterously wrought between square
and oval; that her dark hair lay soft as a shadow on her white brow; not that the trembling
hand she held against her breast sprang from a taper wrist and tapered again to the tips of
the long fingers; nor that she was of that slenderness as strong as it is delicate; not all
the exquisite regularity of line and mould, nor simplicity of color, gave her that significance
which made the Incroyable declare to himself that he stood for the first time in the presence
of Beauty, and that now he knew the women he had been wont to call beautiful were but pretty.
And yet her beauty, he told himself, was the least of her loveliness, for there was a glamour
about her. It was not only the richness of her youth; but there was an ineffable exhalation
which seemed to be made partly of light, partly of the very spirit of her, and, oddly enough,
partly of the scent of the little fan that hung by a ribbon from her waist. This was a woman
like a wine, he felt, there was a bouquet.

In regard to the bouquet of the young man himself, if he possessed one, it is pertinent to
relate that at this very instant the thought skipped across his mind (like the hop of a flea
in a rose-jar) that some day he might find the moment when he could tell her the truth about
herself--with a half-laugh--and say: "The angels sent their haloes in a sandal-wood box to
be made into a woman--and it was you!"

"If you have anything to say for yourself, say it quickly!" said Miss Betty.

"You were singing a while ago," he answered, somewhat huskily, "and I stopped on the street
to listen; then I came here to be nearer. The spell of your voice--" He broke off abruptly
to change the word. "The spell of the song came over me--it is my dearest favorite--so that
I stood afterward in a sort of trance, only hearing again, in the silence, 'The stolen heart,
like the gathered rose, will bloom but for a day!' I did not see you until you came to the
bench. You must believe me: I would not have frightened you for anything in the world."

"Why are you wearing that dress?"

He laughed, and pointed to where, behind him on the ground, lay a long gray cloak, upon which
had been tossed a white mask. "I'm on my way to the masquerade;" he answered, with an airy
gesture in the direction of the violins. "I'm an Incroyable, you see; and I had the costume
made from my recollection of a sketch of your great-uncle. I saw it a long time ago in your
library."

Miss Carewe's accustomed poise was quite recovered; indeed, she was astonished to discover
a distinct trace of disappointment that the brilliant apparition must offer so tame an explanation.
What he said was palpably the truth; there was a masquerade that night, she knew, at the Madrillon's,
a little way up Carewe Street, and her father had gone, an hour earlier, a blue domino over
his arm.

The Incroyable was a person of almost magical perceptiveness; he felt the let-down immediately
and feared a failure. This would not do; the attitude of tension between them must be renewed
at once. "You'll forgive me?" he began, in a quickly impassioned tone. "It was only after you
sang, a dream possessed me, and--"

"I cannot stay to talk with you," Miss Betty interrupted, and added, with a straightforwardness
which made him afraid she would prove lamentably direct: "I do not know you."

Perhaps she remembered that already one young man had been presented to her by no better sponsor
than a white cat, and had no desire to carry her unconventionality farther than that. In the
present instance there was not even a kitten.

She turned toward the house, whereupon he gave a little pathetic exclamation of pleading in
a voice that was masterly, being as sincere as it was musical, and he took a few leaning steps
toward her, both hands outstretched.

"One moment more!" he cried, as she turned again to him. "It may be the one chance of my life
to speak with you; don't deny me this.--All the rest will meet you when the happy evening comes,
will dance with you, talk with you, see you when they like, listen to you sing. I, alone, must
hover about the gates, or steal like a thief into your garden to hear you from a distance.
Listen to me--just this once--for a moment?"

"I cannot listen," she said firmly; and stood quite still. She was now in deep shadow.

"I will not believe you merciless! You would not condemn the meanest criminal unheard!" Remembering
that she was so lately from the convent, he ventured this speech in a deep, thrilling voice,
only to receive a distinct shock for his pains, for she greeted it with an irrepressible, most
unexpected peal of contralto laughter, and his lips parted slightly with the surprise of it.

They parted much farther in the next instant--in good truth, it may be stated of the gentleman
that he was left with his mouth open--for, suddenly leaning toward him out of the shadow into
the light, her face shining as a cast of tragedy, she cried in a hoarse whisper:

"Are you a murderer?"

And with that and a whisk of her skirts, and a footfall on the gravel path, she was gone. He
stood dumbfounded, poor comedian, having come to play the chief role, but to find the scene
taken out of his hands. Then catching the flutter of her wrap, as she disappeared into the
darkness of the veranda, he cried in a loud, manly voice:

"You are a dear!"

As he came out into the street through a gap in the hedge, he paused, drawing his cloak about
him, and lifted his face to the eastern moon. It was a strange face: the modelling most like
what is called "Greek," save for the nose, which was a trifle too short for that, and the features
showed a happy purity of outline almost childlike; the blue eyes, clear, fleckless, serenely
irresponsible, with more the look of refusing responsibility than being unconscious of it;
eyes without care, without prudence, and without evil. A stranger might have said he was about
twenty-five and had never a thought in his life. There were some blossoms on the hedge, and
he touched one lightly, as though he chucked it under the chin; he smiled upon it then, but
not as he had smiled upon Miss Betty, for this was his own, the smile that came when he was
alone; and, when it came, the face was no longer joyous as it had been in repose; there was
an infinite patience and worn tolerance-possibly for himself. This incongruous and melancholy
smile was astonishing: one looked for the laughter of a boy and found, instead, a gentle, worldly,
old prelate.

Standing there, all alone in the moonlight, by the hedge, he lifted both hands high and waved
them toward the house, as children wave to each other across lawns at twilight. After that
he made a fantastic bow to his corrugated shadow on the board sidewalk.

"Again, you rogue!" he exclaimed aloud. Then, as he faced about and began to walk in the direction
of the beckoning violins: "I wonder if Tom's kitten was better, after all!"

CHAPTER III. The Rogue's Gallery of a Father Should be Exhibited to a Daughter with Particular Care

Those angels appointed to be guardians of the merry people of Rouen, poising one night, between
earth and stars, discovered a single brilliant and resonant spot, set in the midst of the dark,
quiet town like a jewelled music-box on a black cloth. Sounds of revelry and the dance from
the luminous spot came up through the summer stillness to the weary guardians all night long,
until, at last, when a red glow stole into the east, and the dance still continued, nay, grew
faster than ever, the celestial watchers found the work too heavy for their strength, and forthwith
departed, leaving the dancers to their own devices; for, as everyone knows, when a dance lasts
till daylight, guardian angels flee.

All night long the fiddles had been swinging away at their best; all night long the candles
had shone in thin rows of bright orange through the slits of the window-blinds; but now, as
the day broke over the maples, the shutters were flung open by laughing young men, and the
drivers of the carriages, waiting in the dusty street, pressed up closer to the hedge, or came
within and stretched themselves upon the lawn, to see the people waltzing in the daylight.
The horses, having no such desires, stood with loosened check-reins, slightly twitching their
upper lips, wistful of the tall grass which bordered the wooden sidewalk, though now and then
one would lift his head high, sniffing the morning air and bending an earnest gaze not upon
the dancers but upon the florid east.

Over the unwearied plaint of French-horn, violin, and bassoon, rose a silvery confusion of
voices and laughter and the sound of a hundred footfalls in unison, while, from the open windows
there issued a warm breath, heavily laden with the smell of scented fans, of rich fabrics,
of dying roses, to mingle with the spicy perfume of a wild crab-tree in fullest blossom, which
stood near enough to peer into the ball-room, and, like a brocaded belle herself, challenge
the richest to show raiment as fine, the loveliest to look as fair and joyful in the dawn..

"Believe me, of all those endearing young charms, Which I gaze on so fondly to-day, Were to
fade by to-morrow and fleet from my arms, Like fairy gifts fading away--"

And the jealous crab-tree found but one to overmatch itself in beauty: a lady who was the focus
of the singing; for, by the time the shutters were flung open, there was not a young man in
the room, lacked he never so greatly in music or in voice, who did not heartily desire to sing
to Miss Betty Carewe, and who did not now (craning neck over partner's shoulder) seek to fix
her with his glittering eye, while he sang "Oh, believe me" most directly and conspicuously
at her. For that night was the beginning of Miss Betty's famous career as the belle of Rouen,
and was the date from which strangers were to hear of her as "the beautiful Miss Carewe," until
"beautiful" was left off, visitors to the town being supposed to have heard at least that much
before they came.

There had been much discussion of her, though only one or two had caught glimpses of her; but
most of the gallants appeared to agree with Crailey Gray, who aired his opinion--in an exceedingly
casual way--at the little club on Main Street. Mr. Gray held that when the daughter of a man
as rich as Bob Carewe was heralded as a beauty the chances were that she would prove disappointing,
and, for his part, he was not even interested enough to attend and investigate. So he was going
down the river in a canoe and preferred the shyness of bass to that of a girl of eighteen just
from the convent, he said. Tom Vanrevel was not present on the occasion of these remarks; and
the general concurrence with Crailey may be suspected as a purely verbal one, since, when the
evening came, two of the most enthusiastic dancers and love-makers of the town, the handsome
Tappingham Marsh and that doughty ex-dragoon and Indian fighter, stout old General Trumble,
were upon the field before the enemy appeared; that is to say, they were in the new ball-room
before their host; indeed, the musicians had not arrived, and Nelson, an aged negro servitor,
was engaged in lighting the house.

The crafty pair had planned this early descent with a view to monopoly by right of priority,
in case the game proved worth the candle, and they were leaning effectively against the little
railing about the musicians' platform when Mr. Carewe entered the room with his daughter on
his arm.

She was in white, touched with countless small lavender flowers; there were rows and rows of
wonderful silk and lace flounces on her skirt, and her fan hung from a rope of great pearls.
Ah, hideous, blue, rough cloth of the convent, unforgotten, but laid aside forever, what a
chrysalis you were!

Tappingham twitched his companion's sleeve, but the General was already posing; and neither
heard the words of presentation, because Miss Betty gave each of them a quick look, then smiled
upon them as they bowed; the slayers were prostrated before their prey. Never were lady-killers
more instantaneously tamed and subjugated by the power of the feminine eye. Will Cummings came
in soon, and, almost upon his heels, Eugene Madrillon and young Frank Chenoweth. No others
appeared for half an hour, and the five gentlemen looked at one another aside, each divining
his own diplomacy in his fellow's eye, and each laboriously explaining to the others his own
mistake in regard to the hour designated upon Mr. Carewe's cards of invitation. This small
embarrassment, however, did not prevent General Trumble and young Mr. Chenoweth from coming
to high words over Miss Carewe's little, gilt-filigree "programme" of dances.

It may be not untimely to remark, also, of these five redoubtable beaux, that, during the evening,
it occurred to every one of them to be glad that Crailey Gray was betrothed to Fanchon Bareaud,
and that he was down on the Rouen River with a canoe, a rod and a tent. Nay, without more words,
to declare the truth in regard to Crailey, they felt greater security in his absence from the
field than in his betrothal. As Mr. Chenoweth, a youth as open as out-of-doors, both in countenance
and mind, observed plaintively to Tappingham Marsh in a corner, while they watched Miss Betty's
lavender flowers miraculously swirling through a quadrille: "Crailey, you know, well, Crailey's
been engaged before!" It was not Mr. Chenoweth's habit to disguise his apprehensions, and Crailey
Gray would not fish for bass forever.

The same Chenoweth was he, who, maddened by the General's triumphantly familiar way of toying
with Miss Betty's fan between two dances, attempted to propose to her during the sunrise waltz.
Having sung "Oh, believe me" in her ear as loudly as he could, he expressed the wish--quite
as loudly--"That this waltz might last for always!"

That was the seventh time it had been said to Betty during the night, and though Mr. Chenoweth's
predecessors had revealed their desires in a guise lacking this prodigious artlessness, she
already possessed no novel acquaintance with the exclamation. But she made no comment; her
partner's style was not a stimulant to repartee. "It would be heaven," he amplified earnestly,
"it would be heaven to dance with you forever--on a desert isle where the others couldn't come!"
he finished with sudden acerbity as his eye caught the General's.

He proceeded, and only the cessation of the music aided Miss Carewe in stopping the declaration
before it was altogether out; and at that point Frank's own father came to her rescue, though
in a fashion little saving of her confusion. The elder Chenoweth was one of the gallant and
kindly Southern colony that made it natural for Rouen always to speak of Miss Carewe as "Miss
Betty". He was a handsome old fellow, whose hair, long moustache and imperial were as white
as he was proud of them, a Virginian with the admirable Southern fearlessness of being thought
sentimental. Mounting a chair with complete dignity, he lifted a glass of wine high in the
air, and, when all the other glasses had been filled, proposed the health of his young hostess.
He made a speech of some length, pronouncing himself quite as hopelessly in love with his old
friend's daughter as all could see his own son was; and wishing her long life and prosperity,
with many allusions to fragrant bowers and the Muses.

It made Miss Betty happy, but it was rather trying, too, for she could only stand with downcast
eyes before them all, trembling a little, and receiving a mixed impression of Mr. Chenoweth's
remarks, catching fragments here and there: "And may the blush upon that gentle cheek, lovelier
than the radiant clouds at set of sun," and "Yet the sands of the hour-glass must fall, and
in the calm and beauteous old age some day to be her lot, when fond mem'ry leads her back to
view again the brilliant scene about her now, where stand 'fair women and brave men,' winecup
in hand to do her honor, oh, may she wipe the silent tear", and the like.

They were happy people who had not learned to be self-conscious enough to fear doing a pretty
thing openly without mocking themselves for it; and it was a brave circle they made about Betty
Carewe, the charming faces of the women and their fine furbelows, handsome men and tall, all
so gay, so cheerily smiling, and yet so earnest in their welcome to her. No one was afraid
to "let out" his voice; their song went full and strong over the waking town, and when it was
finished the ball was over, too.

The veranda and the path to the gate became like tropic gardens, the fair colors of the women's
dresses, ballooning in the early breeze, making the place seem strewn with giant blossoms.
They all went away at the same time, those in carriages calling farewells to each other and
to the little processions departing on foot in different directions to homes near by. The sound
of the voices and laughter drew away, slowly died out altogether, and the silence of the street
was strange and unfamiliar to Betty. She went to the hedge and watched the musicians, who were
the last to go, until they passed from sight: little black toilsome figures, carrying grotesque
black boxes. While she could still see them, it seemed to her that her ball was not quite over,
and she wished to hold the least speck of it as long as she could; but when they had disappeared,
she faced the truth with a deep sigh: the long, glorious night was finished indeed.

What she needed now was another girl: the two would have gone to Betty's room and danced it
all over again until noon; but she had only her father. She found him smoking a Principe cigar
upon the veranda, so she seated herself timidly, nevertheless with a hopeful glance at him,
on the steps at his feet; and, as she did so, he looked down upon her with something more akin
to geniality than anything she had ever seen in his eye before. It was not geniality itself,
but might be third cousin to it. Indeed, in his way, he was almost proud of her, though he
had no wish to show it. Since one was compelled to display the fact that one possessed a grown
daughter, it was well that she be like this one.

They did not know each other very well, and she often doubted that they would ever become intimate.
There was no sense of companionship for either in the other; she had been unable to break through
his perfunctory, almost formal, manner with her; therefore, because he encouraged no af-fection
in her, she felt none, and wondered why, since he was her father. She was more curious about
him than interested, and, though she did not know it, she was prepared to judge him--should
occasion arise--precisely as she would judge any other mere acquaintance. This morning, for
the first time, she was conscious of a sense of warmth and gratitude toward him: the elaborate
fashion in which he had introduced her to his friends made it appear possible that he liked
her; for he had forgotten nothing, and to remember everything in this case was to be lavish,
which has often the appearance of generosity.

And yet there had been a lack: some small thing she had missed, though she was not entirely
sure that she identified it; but the lack had not been in her father or in anything he had
done. Then, too, there was something so unexpectedly human and pleasant in his not going to
bed at once, but remaining to smoke on the veranda at this hour, that she gave him credit for
a little of her own excitement, innocently fancying that he, also, might feel the need of a
companion with whom to talk over the brilliant passages of the night. And a moment ensued when
she debated taking his hand. She was too soon glad that her intuition forbade the demonstration.

"It was all so beautiful, papa," she said, timidly. "I have no way to tell you how I thank you."

"You may do that," he replied, evenly, with no unkindness, with no kindness, either, in the
level of his tone, "by never dancing again more than twice with one man in one evening."

"I think I should much prefer not, myself," she returned, lifting her head to face him gravely.
"I believe if I cared to dance more than once with one, I should like to dance all of them
with him."

Mr. Carewe frowned. "I trust that you discovered none last night whom you wished to honor with
your entire programme?"

"No," she laughed, "not last night."

Her father tossed away his cigar abruptly "Is it too much to hope," he inquired, "that when
you discover a gentleman with whom you desire to waltz all night, you will omit to mention
the fact to him?"

There was a brief flash of her eye as she recalled her impulse to take his hand, but she immediately
looked at him with such complete seriousness that he feared his irony had been thrown away.

"I'll remember not to mention it," she answered. "I'll tell him you told me not too."

"I think you may retire now," said Mr. Carewe, sharply.

She rose from the steps, went to the door, then turned at the threshold. "Were all your friends
here, papa?"

"Do you think that every ninny who gabbled in my house last night was my friend?" he said,
angrily. "There was one friend of mine, Mrs. Tanberry, who wasn't here, because she is out
of town; but I do not imagine that you are inquiring about women. You mean: Was every unmarried
male idiot who could afford a swallow-tailed coat and a clean pair of gloves cavorting about
the place? Yes, miss, they were all here except two, and one of those is a fool, the other
a knave."

"Can't I know the fool?" she asked, eagerly.

"I rejoice to find them so rare in your experience!" he retorted. "This one is out of town,
though I have no doubt you will see him sufficiently often when he returns. His name is Crailey
Gray, and he is to marry Fanchon Bareaud--if he remembers!"

"And the knave?"

"Is one!" Carewe shut his teeth with a venomous snap, and his whole face reddened suddenly.
"I'll mention this fellow once--now," he said, speaking each word with emphasis. "His name
is Vanrevel. You see that gate; you see the line of my property there: the man himself, as
well as every other person in the town, remembers well that the last time I spoke to him, it
was to tell him that if he ever set foot on ground of mine I'd shoot him down, and he knows,
and they all know, I shall keep my word! Elsewhere, I told him that for the sake of public
peace, I should ignore him. I do. You will see him everywhere; but it will not be difficult;
no one will have the hardihood to present him to my daughter. The quarrel between us--" Mr.
Carewe broke off for a moment, his hands clinching the arms of his chair, while he swallowed
with difficulty, as though he choked upon some acrid bolus, and he was so strongly agitated
by his own mention of his enemy that he controlled himself by a painful effort of his will.
"The quarrel between us is political--and personal. You will remember."

"I shall remember," she answered in a rather frightened voice.

... It was long before she fell asleep. "I alone must hover about the gates or steal into your
garden like a thief," the Incroyable had said. "The last time I spoke to him it was to tell
him that if he ever set foot on ground of mine, I'd shoot him down!" had been her father's
declaration. And Mr. Carewe had spoken with the most undeniable air of meaning what he said.
Yet she knew that the Incroyable would come again.

Also, with hot cheeks pressed into her pillow, Miss Betty had identified the young man in the
white hat, that dark person whose hand she had far too impetuously seized in both of hers.
Aha! It was this gentleman who looked into people's eyes and stammered so sincerely over a
pretty speech that you almost believed him, it was he who was to marry Fanchon Bareaud--"if
he remembers!" No wonder Fanchon had been in such a hurry to get him away.... "If he remembers!"
Such was that young man's character, was it? Miss Carewe laughed aloud to her pillow: for,
was one to guess the reason, also, of his not having come to her ball? Had the poor man been
commanded to be "out of town?"

Then, remembering the piquant and generous face of Fanchon, Betty clinched her fingers tightly
and crushed the imp who had suggested the unworthy thought, crushed him to a wretched pulp
and threw him out of the open window. He immediately sneaked in by the back way, for, in spite
of her victory, she still felt a little sorry for poor Fanchon.

CHAPTER IV. "But Spare Your Country's Flag"

If it be true that love is the great incentive to the useless arts, the number of gentlemen
who became poets for the sake of Miss Betty Carewe need not be considered extraordinary. Of
all that was written of her dancing, Tom Vanrevel's lines, "I Danced with Her beneath the Lights"
(which he certainly had not done when he wrote them) were, perhaps, next to Crailey Gray's
in merit, though Tom burned his rhymes after reading them to Crailey. Other troubadours were
not so modest, and the Rouen Journal found no lack of tuneful offering, that spring, generously
print-ing all of it, even at the period when it became epidemic. The public had little difficulty
in recognizing the work of Mr. Francis Chenoweth in an anonymous "Sonnet" (of twenty-three
lines) which appeared in the issue following Miss Carewe's debut. Mr. Chenoweth wrote that
while dancing the mazourka with a Lovely Being, the sweetest feelings of his soul, in a celestial
stream, bore him away beyond control, in a seraphic dream; and he untruthfully stated that
at the same time he saw her wipe the silent tear, omitting, however, to venture any explanation
of the cause of her emotion. Old General Trumble boldly signed his poem in full. It was called
"An Ode upon Miss C--'s Waltzing," and it began:

"When Bettina found fair Rouen's shore, And her aged father to us bore Her from the cloister
neat, She waltzed upon the ball-room floor, And lightly twirled upon her feet."

Mr. Carewe was rightfully indignant, and refused to acknowledge the General's salutation at
their next meeting: Trumble was fifteen years older than he.

As Crailey Gray never danced with Miss Carewe, it is somewhat singular that she should have
been the inspiration of his swinging verses in waltz measure, "Heart-strings on a Violin,"
the sense of which was that when a violin had played for her dancing, the instrument should
be shattered as wine-glasses are after a great toast. However, no one, except the author himself,
knew that Betty was the subject; for Crailey certainly did not mention it to Miss Bareaud,
nor to his best friend, Vanrevel.

It was to some degree a strange comradeship between these two young men; their tastes led them
so often in opposite directions. They had rooms to-gether over their offices in the "Madrillon
Block" on Main Street, and the lights shone late from their windows every night in the year.
Sometimes that would mean only that the two friends were talking, for they never reached a
silent intimacy, but, even after several years of companionship, were rarely seen together
when not in interested, often eager, conversation, so that people wondered what in the world
they still found to say to each other. But many a night the late-shining lamp meant that Tom
sat alone, with a brief or a book, or wooed the long hours with his magical guitar. For he
never went to bed until the other came home.

And if daylight came without Crailey, Vanrevel would go out, yawning mightily, to look for
him; and when there was no finding him, Tom would come back, sleepless, to the day's work.
Crailey was called "peculiar" and he explained, with a kind of jovial helplessness, that he
was always prepared for the unexpected in himself, nor did such a view detract from his picturesqueness
to his own perusal of himself; though it was not only to himself that he was interesting. To
the vision of the lookers-on in Rouen, quiet souls who hovered along the walls at merry-makings
and cheerfully counted themselves spectators at the play, Crailey Gray held the centre of the
stage and was the chief comedian of the place. Element'Lids, colt. Iii, in property are take at

 The quill dropped from her hand; she
started to her feet, wide-eyed, not understanding; while the whole town, drowsing peacefully
a moment ago, resounded immediately with a loud confusion. She ran to the front door and looked
out, her heart beating wildly.

The western sky was touched with a soft rose-color, which quickly became a warm glow, fluctuated,
and, in the instant, shot up like the coming of a full Aurora. Then through the broken foliage
of the treetops could be seen the orange curls of flames, three-quarters of a mile away though
they were.

People, calling loudly that "it was Carewe's warehouses," were running down the street. From
the stable, old Nelson, on her father's best horse, came galloping, and seeing the white figure
in the doorway, cried out in a quavering voice, without checking his steed.

"I goin' tell yo' pa, Miss Betty, he in de kentry on lan' bus'ness. Go back in de house, Missy!"

The other servants, like ragged sketches in the night, flitted by, with excited ejaculations,
to join the runners, and Miss Betty followed them across the dew-strewn turf in her night slippers,
but at the gate she stopped.

From up the street came the sound of a bell smaller than those of the churches and courthouse,
yet one that outdid all others in the madness of its appeal to clear the way. It was borne
along by what seemed at first an indefinite black mass, but which--as the Aurora grew keener,
producing even here a faint, yellow twilight--resolved itself into a mob of hoarsely-shouting
men and boys, who were running and tugging at ropes, which drew along three extraordinary vehicles.
They came rapidly down the street and passed Miss Betty with a hubbub and din beyond all understanding;
one line of men, most of them in red shirts and oil-cloth helmets, at a dead run with the hose-cart;
a second line with the hand-engine; the third dragging the ladder-wagon. One man was riding,
a tall, straight gentleman in evening clothes and without a hat, who stood precariously in
the hose-cart, calling in an annoyed tone through a brazen trumpet. Miss Betty recognized him
at once; it was he who caught her kitten; and she thought that if she had been Fanchon Bareaud
she must have screamed a warning, for his balance appeared a thing of mere luck, and, if he
fell, he would be trampled under foot and probably run over by the engine. But, happily (she
remembered), she was not Fanchon Bareaud!

Before, behind, and beside the Department, raced a throng of boys, wild with the joy experienced
by their species when property is being handsomely destroyed; after them came panting women,
holding their sides and gasping with the effort to keep up with the flying procession.

Miss Betty trembled, for she had never seen the like in her life; she stood close to the hedge
and let them go by; then she turned in after them and ran like a fleet young deer. She was
going to the fire.

Over all the uproar could be heard the angry voice through the trumpet, calling the turns of
the streets to the men in the van, upbraiding them and those of the other two companies impartially;
and few of his hearers denied the chief his right to express some chagrin; since the Department
(organized a half-year, hard-drilled, and this its first fire worth the name) was late on account
of the refusal of the members to move until they had donned their new uniforms; for the uniforms
had arrived from Philadelphia two months ago, and tonight offered the first opportunity to
display them in public.

"Hail Vanrevel!" panted Tappingham Marsh to Eugene Madrillon, as the two, running in the van
of the "Hose Company," splattered through a mud-puddle. "You'd think he was Carewe's only son
and heir instead of his worst enemy. Hark to the man!"

"I'd let it burn, if I were he," returned the other.

"It was all Crailey's fault," said Tappingham, swinging an arm free to wipe the spattered mud
from his face. "He swore he wouldn't budge without his uniform, and the rest only backed him
up; that was all. Crailey said Carewe could better afford to lose his shanties than the overworked
Department its first chance to look beautiful and earnest. Tom asked him why he didn't send
for a fiddle," Marsh finished with a chuckle.

"Carewe might afford to lose a little, even a warehouse or two, if only out of what he's taken
from Crailey and the rest of us, these three years!"

"Taken from Vanrevel, you mean. Who doesn't know where Crailey's--Here's Main Street; look
out for the turn!"

They swung out of the thick shadows of Carewe Street into full view of the fire, and their
faces were illuminated as by sunrise.

The warehouses stood on the river-bank, at the foot of the street, just south of the new "covered
bridge." There were four of them, huge, bare-sided buildings; the two nearer the bridge of
brick, the others of wood, and all of them rich with stores of every kind of river-merchandise
and costly freight: furniture that had voyaged from New England down the long coast, across
the Mexican Gulf, through the flat Delta, and had made the winding journey up the great river
a thousand miles, and almost a thousand more, following the greater and lesser tributaries;
cloth from Connecticut that had been sold in Philadelphia, then carried over mountains and
through forests by steam, by canal, by stage, and six-mule freight-wagons, to Pittsburg, down
the Ohio, and thence up to Rouen on the packet; Tennessee cotton, on its way to Massachusetts
and Rhode Island spindles, lay there beside huge mounds of raw wool from Illinois, ready to
be fed to the Rouen mill; dates and nuts from the Caribbean Sea; lemons from groves of the
faraway tropics; cigars from the Antilles; tobacco from Virginia and Kentucky; most precious
of all, the great granary of the farmers' wheat from the level fields at home; and all the
rich stores and the houses that held them, as well as the wharves upon which they had been
landed, and the steamers that brought them up the Rouen River, belonged to Robert Carewe.

That it was her father's property which was imperilled attested to the justification of Miss
Betty in running to a fire; and, as she followed the crowd into Main Street, she felt a not
unpleasant proprietary interest in the spectacle. Very opposite sensations animated the breast
of the man with the trumpet, who was more acutely conscious than any other that these were
Robert Carewe's possessions which were burning so handsomely. Nor was he the only one among
the firemen who ground his teeth over the folly of the uniforms; for now they could plainly
see the ruin being wrought, the devastation threatened. The two upper stories of the southernmost
warehouse had swathed themselves in one great flame; the building next on the north, also of
frame, was smoking heavily; and there was a wind from the southwest, which, continuing with
the fire unchecked, threatened the town itself. There was work for the Volunteer Brigade that
night.

They came down Main Street with a rush, the figure of their chief swaying over them on his
high perch, while their shouting was drowned in the louder roar of greeting from the crowd,
into which they plunged as a diver into the water, swirls and eddies of people marking the
wake. A moment later a section of the roof of the burning warehouse fell in, with a sonorous
and reverberating crash.

The "Engine Company" ran the force-pump out to the end of one of the lower wharves; two lines
of pipe were attached; two rows of men mounted the planks for the pumpers, and, at the word
of command, began the up-and-down of the hand-machine with admirable vim. Nothing happened;
the water did not come; something appeared to be wrong with the mechanism. As everyone felt
the crucial need of haste, nothing could have been more natural than that all the members of
the "Engine Company" should simultaneously endeavor to repair the defect; therefore ensued
upon the spot a species of riot which put the engine out of its sphere of usefulness.

In the meantime, fifty or sixty men and boys who ran with the machines, but who had no place
in their operation, being the Bucket Brigade, had formed a line and were throwing large pails
of water in the general direction of the southernmost warehouse, which it was now impossible
to save; while the gentlemen of the "Hook-and-Ladder Company," abandoning their wagons, and
armed with axes, heroically assaulted the big door of the granary, the second building, whence
they were driven by the exasperated chief, who informed them that the only way to save the
wheat was to save the building. Crailey Gray, one of the berated axemen, remained by the shattered
door after the others had gone, and, struck by a sudden thought, set his hand upon the iron
latch and opened the door by this simple process. It was not locked. Crailey leaned against
the casement and laughed with his whole soul and body.

Meanwhile, by dint of shouting in men's ears when near them, through the trumpet when distant,
tearing axes from their hands, imperiously gesticulating to subordinate commanders, and lingering
in no one spot for more than a second, Mr. Vanrevel reduced his forces to a semblance of order
in a remarkably short time, considering the confusion into which they had fallen.

The space between the burning warehouse and that next it was not more than fifty feet in width,
but fifty feet so hot no one took thought of entering there; an area as discomfiting in appearance
as it was beautiful with the thick rain of sparks and firebrands that fell upon it. But the
chief had decided that this space must be occupied, and more: must be held, since it was the
only point of defence for the second warehouse. The roof of this building would burn, which
would mean the destruction of the warehouse, unless it could be mounted, because the streams
of water could not play upon it from the ground, nor, from the ladders, do much more than wet
the projecting eaves. It was a gable roof, the eaves twenty feet lower on the south side than
on the north, where the ladders could not hope to reach them. Vanrevel swung his line of bucketeers
round to throw water, not upon the flames, but upon the ladder-men.

Miss Carewe stood in the crowd upon the opposite side of the broad street. Even there her cheeks
were uncomfortably hot, and sometimes she had to brush a spark from her shoulder, though she
was too much excited to mind this. She was watching the beautiful fiery furnace between the
north wall of the burning warehouse and the south wall of its neighbor, the fifty feet brilliant
and misty with vaporous rose-color, dotted with the myriad red stars, her eyes shining with
the reflection of their fierce beauty. She saw how the vapors moved there, like men walking
in fire, and she was vaguely recalling Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, when, over the silhouetted
heads of the crowd before her, a long black ladder rose, wobbled, tilted crazily, then lamely
advanced and ranged itself against the south wall of the second warehouse, its top rung striking
ten feet short of the eaves. She hoped that no one had any notion of mounting that ladder.

A figure appeared upon it immediately, that of a gentleman, bareheaded and in evening dress,
with a brass trumpet swinging from a cord about his shoulders; the noise grew less; the shouting
died away, and the crowd became almost silent, as the figure, climbing slowly drew up above
their heads. Two or three rungs beneath, came a second--a man in helmet and uniform. The clothes
of both men, drenched by the bucketeers, clung to them, steaming. As the second figure mounted,
a third appeared; but this was the last, for the ladder was frail, and sagged toward the smoking
wall with the weight of the three.

The chief, three-fourths of the way to the top, shouted down a stifled command, and a short
grappling-ladder, fitted at one end with a pair of spiked iron hooks, was passed to him. Then
he toiled upward until his feet rested on the third rung from the top; here he turned, setting
his back to the wall, lifted the grappling-ladder high over his head so that it rested against
the eaves above him, and brought it down sharply, fastening the spiked hooks in the roof. As
the eaves projected fully three feet, this left the grappling-ladder hanging that distance
out from the wall, its lowest rung a little above the level of the chief's shoulders.

Miss Betty drew in her breath with a little choked cry. There was a small terraced hill of
piled-up packing-boxes near her, possession of which had been taken by a company of raggamuffinish
boys, and she found herself standing on the highest box and sharing the summit with these questionable
youths, almost without noting her action in mounting thither, so strained was the concentration
of her attention upon the figure high up in the rose-glow against the warehouse wall. The man,
surely, surely, was not going to trust himself to that bit of wooden web hanging from the roof!
Where was Miss Bareaud that she permitted it? Ah, if Betty had been Fanchon and madwoman enough
to have accepted this madman, she would have compelled him to come down at once, and thereafter
would lock him up in the house whenever the bells rang!

But the roof was to be mounted or Robert Carewe's property lost. Already little flames were
dancing up from the shingles, where firebrands had fallen, their number increasing with each
second. So Vanrevel raised his arms, took a hard grip upon the lowest rung of the grappling-ladder
and tried it with his weight; the iron hooks bit deeper into the roof; they held. He swung
himself out into the air with nothing beneath him, caught the rung under his knee, and for
a moment hung there while the crowd withheld from breathing; then a cloud of smoke, swirling
that way, made him the mere ghostly nucleus of himself, blotted him out altogether, and, as
it rose slowly upward, showed the ladder free and empty, so that at first there was an instant
when they thought that he had fallen. But, as the smoke cleared, there was the tall figure
on the roof.

It was an agile and daring thing to do, and the man who did it was mightily applauded. The
cheering bothered him, however, for he was trying to make them understand, below, what would
happen to the "Engine Company" in case the water was not sent through the lines directly; and
what he said should be done to the engineers included things that would have blanched the cheek
of the most inventive Spanish Inquisitor that ever lived.

Miss Betty made a gesture as if to a person within whispering distance. "Your coat is on fire,"
she said in an ordinary conversational tone, without knowing she had spoken aloud, and Mr.
Vanrevel, more than one hundred feet away, seemed particularly conscious of the pertinence
of her remark. He removed the garment with alacrity, and, for the lack of the tardy water,
began to use it as a flail upon the firebrands and little flames about him; the sheer desperate
best of a man in a rage, doing what he could when others failed him. Showers of sparks fell
upon him; the smoke was rising everywhere from the roof and the walls below; and, growing denser
and denser, shrouded him in heavy veils, so that, as he ran hither and thither, now visible,
now unseen, stamping and beating and sweeping away the brands that fell, he seemed but the
red and ghostly caricature of a Xerxes, ineffectually lashing the sea. They were calling to
him imploringly to come down, in heaven's name to come down!

The second man had followed to the top of the ladder against the wall, and there he paused,
waiting to pass up the line of hose when the word should come that the force-pump had been
repaired; but the people thought that he waited because he was afraid to trust himself to the
grappling-ladder. He was afraid, exceedingly afraid; though that was not why he waited; and
he was still chuckling over the assault of the axes.

His situation had not much the advantage of that of the chief: his red shirt might have been
set with orange jewels, so studded it was with the flying sparks; and, a large brand dropping
upon his helmet, he threw up his hand to dislodge it and lost the helmet. The great light fell
upon his fair hair and smiling face, and it was then that Miss Betty recognized the Incroyable
of her garden.

CHAPTER VI. The Ever Unpractical Feminine

It was an investigating negro child of tender years, who, possessed of a petty sense of cause
and effect, brought an illuminative simplicity to bear upon the problem of the force-pump;
and a multitudinous agitation greeted his discovery that the engineers had forgotten to connect
their pipes with the river.

This naive omission was fatal to the second warehouse; the wall burst into flame below Crailey
Gray, who clung to the top of the ladder, choking, stifled, and dizzily fighting the sparks
that covered him, yet still clutching the nozzle of the hose-line they had passed to him. When
the stream at last leaped forth, making the nozzle fight in his grasp, he sent it straight
up into the air and let the cataract fall back upon himself and upon the two men beneath him
on the ladder.

There came a moment of blessed relief; and he looked out over the broad rosy blur of faces
in the street, where no one wondered more than he how the water was to reach the roof. Suddenly
he started, wiped his eyes with his wet sleeve, and peered intently down from under the shading
arm. His roving glance crossed the smoke and flame to rest upon a tall, white figure that stood,
full-length above the heads of the people, upon a pedestal wrought with the grotesque images
of boys: a girl's figure, still as noon, enrapt, like the statue of some young goddess for
whom were made these sacrificial pyres. Mr. Gray recognized his opportunity.

A blackened and unrecognizable face peered down from the eaves, and the voice belonging to
it said, angrily: "Why didn't they send up that line before they put the water through it?"

"Never mind, Tom," answered Crailey cheerfully, "I'll bring it up." "You can't; I'll come down
for it. Don't be every kind of a fool!"

"You want a monopoly, do you?" And Crailey, calling to Tappingham Marsh, next below him, to
come higher, left the writhing nozzle in the latter's possession, swung himself out upon the
grappling-ladder, imitating the chief's gymnastics, and immediately, one hand grasping the
second rung, one knee crooked over the lowest, leaned head down and took the nozzle from Marsh.
It was a heavy weight, and though Marsh supported the line beneath it, the great stream hurtling
forth made it a difficult thing to manage, for it wriggled, recoiled and struggled as if it
had been alive. Crailey made three attempts to draw himself up; but the strain was too much
for his grip, and on the third attempt his fingers melted from the rung, and he swung down
fearfully, hanging by his knee, but still clinging to the nozzle.

"Give it up, Crailey; it isn't worth it," Vanrevel called from overhead, not daring the weight
of both on the light grappling-ladder.

But though Crailey cared no more for the saving of Robert Carewe's property than for a butterfly's
wing in China, he could not give up now, any more than as a lad he could have forborne to turn
somersaults when the prettiest little girl looked out of the school-house window. He passed
the nozzle to Tappingham, caught the second rung with his left hand, and, once more hanging
head downward, seized the nozzle; then, with his knee hooked tight, as the gushing water described
a huge semicircle upon the smoke and hot vapor, he made a mad lurch through the air, while
women shrieked; but he landed upright, half-sitting on the lowest rung. He climbed the grappling-ladder
swiftly, in spite of the weight and contortions of the unmanageable beast he carried with him;
Tom leaned far down and took it from him; and Crailey, passing the eaves, fell, exhausted,
upon the roof. Just as he reached this temporary security, a lady was borne, fainting, out
of the acclaiming crowd. Fanchon was there.

Word had been passed to the gentlemen of the "Engine Company" to shut off the water in order
to allow the line to be carried up the ladder, and they received the command at the moment
Tom lifted the nozzle, so that the stream dried up in his hands. This was the last straw, and
the blackened, singed and scarred chief, setting the trumpet to his lips, gave himself entirely
to wrath.

It struck Crailey, even as he lay, coughing and weeping with smoke, that there was something
splendid and large in the other's rage. Vanrevel was ordinarily so steady and cool that this
was worth seeing, this berserker gesture; worth hearing, this wonderful profanity, like Washington's
one fit of cursing; and Crailey, knowing Tom, knew, too, that it had not come upon him because
Carewe had a daughter into whose eyes Tom had looked; nor did he rage because he believed that
Crailey's life and his were in the greater hazard for the lack of every drop of water that
should have issued from the empty nozzle. It be what the tea, but our merchants who have counted Explosive,

The five young men on the roof were well aware that there was little to do but to wait, and
soon they would see which was to win, they or the fire; so they shifted their line of hose
to the eastern front of the building--out of harm's way, for a little time, at least--and held
the muzzle steady, watching its work. And in truth it was not long before they understood which
would conquer. The southern and western portions of the building had flung out great flames
that fluttered and flared on the breeze like Titanic flags; and steadily, slowly, at first,
then faster as the seconds flew, the five were driven backward, up the low slope of the roof
toward the gable-ridge. Tom Vanrevel held the first joint of the nozzle, and he retreated with
a sulky face, lifting his foot grudgingly at each step. They were all silent, now, and no one
spoke until Will Cummings faltered:

"Surely they'll get a rope up to us some way?"

Will knew as well as did the others that there was no way; but his speech struck the sullen
heart of the chief with remorse. He turned. "I hope you'll all forgive me for getting you up here."

A sound, half sob, half giggle, came from the parched lips of Eugene Madrillon, as he patted
Tom on the shoulder without speaking, and Crailey nodded quietly, then left the group and went
to the eastern edge of the roof and looked out upon the crowd. Cummings dropped the line and
sat down, burying his hot face in his arms, for they all saw that Vanrevel thought "it was
no use," but a question of a few minutes, and they would retreat across the gable and either
jump or go down with the roof.

Since the world began, idle and industrious philosophers have speculated much upon the thoughts
of men about to die; yet it cannot be too ingenuous to believe that such thoughts vary as the
men, their characters, and conditions of life vary. Nevertheless, pursuant with the traditions
of minstrelsy and romance, it is conceivable that young, unmarried men, called upon to face
desperate situations, might, at the crucial moment, rush to a common experience of summoning
the vision, each of his heart's desire, and to meet, each his doom, with her name upon his lips.

An extraordinary thing occurred in the present instance, for, by means of some fragmentary
remarks let fall at the time, and afterward recalled such as Tappingham Marsh's gasping: "At
least it will be on her father's roof!" and from other things later overheard, an inevitable
deduction has been reached that four of the five gentlemen in the perilous case herein described
were occupied with the vision of the same person, to wit: Miss Elizabeth Carewe, "the last--the
prettiest--to come to town!"

Crailey Gray, alone, spoke not at all; but why did he strain and strain his eyes toward that
empty' pedestal with the grotesque carvings? Did he seek Fanchon there, or was Miss Carewe
the last sweet apparition in the fancies of all five of the unhappy young men?

The coincidence of the actual appearance of the lady among them, therefore seemed the more
miraculous, when, wan and hopeless, staggering desperately backward to the gable-ridge, they
heard a clear contralto voice behind them:

"Hadn't you better all come down now?" it said.--"The stairway will be on fire before long."

Only one thing could have been more shockingly unexpected to the five than that there should
be a sixth person on the roof, and this was that the sixth person should be Miss Betty Carewe.

They turned, aghast, agape, chopfallen with astonishment, stunned, and incredulous.

She stood just behind the gable-ridge, smiling amiably, a most incongruous little pink fan
in her hand, the smoke-wreaths partly obscuring her and curling between the five and her white
dress, like mists floating across the new moon.

Was it but a kindly phantasm of the brain? Was it the incarnation of the last vision of the
lost Volunteers? Was it a Valkyrie assuming that lovely likeness to perch upon this eyrie,
waiting to bear their heroic souls to Valhalla, or--was it Miss Betty Carewe?

To the chief she spoke--all of them agreed to that afterward--but it was Crailey who answered,
while Tom could only stare, and stand wagging his head at the lovely phantom, like a Mandarin
on a shelf.

"My mother in heaven!" gasped Crailey. "How did you come up here?"

"There's a trap in the roof on the other side of the ridge," she said, and she began to fan
herself with the pink fan. "A stairway runs all the way down--old Nelson showed me through
these buildings yesterday--and that side isn't on fire yet. I'm so sorry I didn't think of
it until a moment ago, because you could have brought the water up that way. But don't you
think you'd better come down now?"

CHAPTER VII. The Comedian

Not savage Hun, nor "barbarous Vandyke," nor demon Apache, could wish to dwell upon the state
of mind of the Chief of the Rouen Volunteer Fire Department; therefore, let the curtain of
mercy descend. Without a word, he turned and dragged the nozzle to the eastern eaves, whence,
after a warning gesture to those below, he dropped it to the ground. And, out of compassion,
it should be little more than hinted that the gesture of warning was very slight.

When the rescued band reached the foot of the last flight of stairs, they beheld the open doorway
as a frame for a great press of intent and con-torted faces, every eye still strained to watch
the roof; none of the harrowed spectators comprehending the appearance of the girl's figure
there, nor able to see whither she had led the five young men, until Tappingham Marsh raised
a shout as he leaped out of the door and danced upon the solid earth again.

Then, indeed, there was a mighty uproar; cheer after cheer ascended to the red vault of heaven;
women wept, men whooped, and the people rushed for the heroes with wide-open, welcoming arms.
Jefferson Bareaud and Frank Chenoweth and General Trumble dashed at Tom Vanrevel with incoherent
cries of thanksgiving, shaking his hands and beating him hysterically upon the back. He greeted
them with bitter laughter.

"Help get the water into the next warehouse; this one is beyond control, but we can save the
other two. Take the lines in through the door!" He brushed the rejoicing friends off abruptly,
and went on in a queer, hollow voice: "There are stairs--and I'm so sorry I didn't think of
it until a moment ago, because you could have brought the water up that way!"

A remarkable case of desertion had occurred, the previous instant, under his eyes. As the party
emerged from the warehouse into the street, Tom heard Crailey say hurriedly to Miss Carewe:
"Let me get you away come quickly!" saw him suddenly seize her band, and, eluding the onrushing
crowd, run with her round the corner of the building. And somehow, through what inspiration,
or through what knowledge of his partner's "temperament," heaven knows, the prophetic soul
of the chief was unhappily assured that Crailey would offer himself as escort to her home,
and find acceptance. But why not? Was it Crailey who had publicly called his fellow-man fool,
idiot, imbecile, at the top of his lungs, only to find himself the proven numskull of the universe!
Tom stood for a moment staring after the vanishing pair, while over his face stole the strangest
expression that ever man saw there; then, with meekly bowed shoulders, he turned again to his work.

At the corner of the warehouse, Miss Carewe detached her hand from Crailey's, yet still followed
him as he made a quick detour round the next building. A minute or two later they found themselves,
undetected, upon Main Street in the rear of the crowd. There Crailey paused.

"Forgive me," he said, breathlessly, "for taking your hand. I thought you would like to get away."

She regarded him gravely, so that he found it difficult to read her look, except that it was
seriously questioning; but whether the interrogation was addressed to him or to herself he
could not determine. After a silence she said:

"I don't know why I followed you. I believe it must have been because you didn't give me time
to think."

This, of course, made him even quicker with her than before. "It's all over," he said briskly.
"The first warehouse is gone; the second will go, but they'll save the others easily enough,
now that you have pointed out that the lines may be utilized otherwise than as adjuncts of
performances on the high trapeze!" They were standing by a picket-fence, and he leaned against
it, overcome by mirth in which she did not join. Her gravity reacted upon him at once, and
his laughter was stopped short. "Will you not accept me as an escort to your home?" he said
formally. "I do not know," she returned simply, the sort of honest trouble in her glance that
is seen only in very young eyes.

"'What reason in the world!" he returned, with a crafty sharpness of astonishment.

She continued to gaze upon him thoughtfully, while he tried to look into her eyes, but was
baffled because the radiant beams from the lady's orbs (as the elder Chenoweth might have said)
rested somewhere dangerously near his chin, which worried him, for, though his chin made no
retreat and was far from ill-looking, it was, nevertheless, that feature which he most distrusted.
"Won't you tell me why not?" he repeated, uneasily.

"Because," she answered at last, speaking hesitatingly, "because it isn't so easy a matter
for me as you seem to think. You have not been introduced to me, and I know you never will
be, and that what you told me was true."

"Which part of what I told you?" The question escaped from him instantly.

"That the others might come when they liked, but that you could not."

"Oh yes, yes." His expression altered to a sincere dejection; his shoulders drooped, and his
voice indicated supreme annoyance. "I might have known someone would tell you! Who was it?
Did they say why I--"

"On account of your quarrel with my father."

"My quarrel with your father!" he exclaimed; and his face lit with an elated surprise; his
shoulders straightened. He took a step nearer her, and asked, eagerly: "Who told you that?"

"My father himself. He spoke of a Mr. Vanrevel whom he--disliked, and whom I must not meet;
and, remembering what you had said, of course I knew that you were he."

"Oh!" Crailey's lips began to form a smile of such appealing and inimitable sweetness that
Voltaire would have trusted him; a smile alto-gether rose-leaves. "Then I lose you," he said,
"for my only chance to know you was in keeping it hidden from you. And now you understand!"

"No," she answered, gravely, "I don't understand; that is what troubles me. If I did, and believed
you had the right of the difference, I could believe it no sin that you should speak to me,
should take me home now. I think it is wrong not to act from your own understanding of things."

The young man set his expression as one indomitably fixed upon the course of honor, cost what
it might; and, in the very action, his lurking pleasure in doing it hopped out in the flicker
of a twinkle in his eyes, and as instantly sought cover again--the flea in the rose-jar.

"Then you must ask some other," he said, firmly. "A disinterested person should tell you. The
difference was political in the beginning, but became personal afterward; and it is now a quarrel
which can never be patched up, though, for my part, I wish that it could be. I can say no more,
because a party to it should not speak."

She met his level look squarely at last; and no man ever had a more truthful pair of eyes than
Crailey Gray, for it was his great accomplishment that he could adjust his emotion, his reason,
and something that might be called his faith, to fit any situation in any character.

"You may take me home," she answered. "I may be wrong, and even disloyal; but I do not feel
it so, now. You did a very brave thing tonight to save him from loss, and I think that what
you have said was just what you should have said."

So they went down the street, the hubbub and confusion of the fire growing more and more indistinct
behind them. They walked slowly, and, for a time, neither spoke; yet the silence was of a kind
which the adept rejoiced to have produced thus soon--their second meeting. For he believed
there were more strange things in heaven and earth than Horatio wot; and one of the strangest
was that whenever he was near an attractive woman during a silence such as this, something
not to be defined, but as effective as it was indefinite, always went out from him to her.
It was like a word of tenderness, a word too gentle, too compelling, too sweet, to be part
of any tongue, spoken or written. And more: this ineffable word had an echo, and came back
to him from the woman.

As his partner had in dress, so Crailey had with women, some color of the Beau; but it was
not in what experience had given him to recognize as a fact: that they were apt to fall in
love with him. (That they were apt to remain in love with him--he understood perfectly--was
another matter.) And he knew when they were doing it; could have told them accurately, at each
step, what they were feeling, thinking, dreaming, during the process, because he was usually
exhibiting the same symptoms to himself at the same time.

Thus, his own breast occupied with that dizzy elation which followed its reception of the insane
young god's arrows, and his heart warm with the rise of the old emotion that he knew so well,
he was nevertheless able to walk with his finger on the pulse of the exquisite moment, counting
her heartbeats and his own.

So, to his fancy, as they walked, the little space between them was hung with brilliant strands,
like gossamer chains of gold, already linking them together; every second fixing another slender,
precious fetter, binding them closer, drawing her nearer. He waited until they passed into
the shadows of the deserted Carewe Street before he spoke. There he stopped abruptly; at which
she turned, astonished.

"Now that you have saved my life," he said, in a low, tremulous tone, "what are you going to
do with it?"

Her eyes opened almost as widely as they had at her first sight of him in her garden. There
was a long pause before she replied, and when she did, it was to his considerable surprise.

"I have never seen a play, except the funny little ones we acted at the convent," she said,
"but isn't that the way they speak on the stage?"

Crailey realized that his judgment of the silence bad been mistaken, and yet it was with a
thrill of delight that he recognized her clear reading of him. He had been too florid again.

"Let us go." His voice was soft with restrained forgiveness. "You mocked me once before.

"Mocked you?" she repeated, as they went on.

"Mocked me," he said, firmly. "Mocked me for seeming theatrical, and yet you have learned that
what I said was true; as you will again."

She mused upon this; then, as in whimsical indulgence to an importunate child:

"Well, tell me what you mean when you say I saved your life."

"You came alone," he began, hastily, "to stand upon that burning roof--"

"Whence all but him had fled!" Her laughter rang out, interrupting him. "My room was on the
fourth floor at St. Mary's, and I didn't mind climbing three flights this evening."

Crailey's good-nature was always perfect. "You mock me and you mock me!" he cried, and made
her laughter but part of a gay duet. "I know I have gone too fast, have said things I should
have waited to say; but, ah! remember the small chance I have against the others who can see
you when they like. Don't flout me because I try to make the most of a rare, stolen moment
with you."

"Do!" she exclaimed, grave upon the instant. "Do make the most of it! I have nothing but inexperience.
Make the most by treating me seriously. Won't you? I know you can, and I--I--" She faltered
to a full stop. She was earnest and quiet, and there had been something in her tone, too--as
very often there was--that showed how young she was. "Oh!" she began again, turning to him
impulsively, "I have thought about you since that evening in the garden, and I have wished
I could know you. I can't be quite clear how it happened, but even those few minutes left a
number of strong impressions about you. And the strongest was that you were one with whom I
could talk of a great many things, if you would only be real with me. I believe--though I'm
not sure why I do--that it is very difficult for you to be real; perhaps because you are so
different at different times that you aren't sure, yourself, which the real you is. But the
person that you are beginning to be for my benefit must be the most trifling of all your selves,
lighter and easier to put on than the little mask you carried the other night. If there were
nothing better underneath the mask, I might play, too."

"Did you learn this at the convent?" gasped Crailey.

"There was a world there in miniature," she answered, speaking very quickly. "I think all people
are made of the same materials, only in such different proportions. I think a little world
might hold as much as the largest, if you thought it all out hard enough, and your experience
might be just as broad and deep in a small corner of the earth as anywhere else. But I don't
know! I want to understand--I want to understand everything! I read books, and there are people--but
no one who tells me what I want--I--"

"Stop." He lifted his hand. "I won't act; I shall never 'play' for you again." He was breathless;
the witching silence was nothing to what stirred him now. A singular exaltation rose in him,
together with the reckless impulse to speak from the mood her vehement confidence had in-spired.
He gave way to it.

"I know, I know," he said huskily. "I understand all you mean, all you feel, all you wish.
It is all echoing here, and here, and here!" He touched his breast, his eyes, and his forehead
with the fingers of his long and slender hand. "We sigh and strain our eyes and stretch out
our arms in the dark, groping always for the strange blessing that is just beyond our grasp,
seeking for the precious unknown that lies just over the horizon! It's what they meant by the
pot of gold where the rainbow ends--only, it may be there, after all!"

They stopped unconsciously, and remained standing at the lower end of the Carewe hedge. The
western glow had faded, and she was gazing at him through the darkness, leaning forward, never
dreaming that her tight grasp had broken the sticks of the little pink fan.

"Yes," she whispered, eagerly. "You are right: you understand!"

He went on, the words coming faster and faster: "We are haunted--you and I--by the wish to
know all things, and by the question that lies under every thought we have: the agonizing Whither?
Isn't it like that? It is really death that makes us think. You are a good Catholic: you go
to mass; but you wish to know. Does God reign, or did it all happen? Sometimes it seems so
deadly probable that the universe just was, no God to plan it, nothing but things; that we
die as sparrows die, and the brain is all the soul we have, a thing that becomes clogged and
stops some day. And is that all?"

She shivered slightly, but her steadfast eyes did not shift from him. He threw back his head,
and his face, uplifted to the jewelled sky of the moonless night, was beatific in its peacefulness,
as he continued in an altered tone, gentle and low:

"I think all questions are answered there. The stars tell it all. When you look at them you
know! They have put them on our flag. There are times when this seems but a poor nation: boastful,
corrupt, violent, and preparing, as it is now, to steal another country by fraud and war; yet
the stars on the flag always make me happy and confident. Do you see the constellations swinging
above us, such unimaginable vastnesses, not roving or crashing through the illimitable at haphazard,
but moving in more excellent measure, and to a finer rhythm, than the most delicate clockwork
man ever made? The great ocean-lines mark our seas with their paths through the water; the
fine brains of the earth are behind the ships that sail from port to port, yet how awry the
system goes! When does a ship come to her harbor at an hour determined when she sailed? What
is a ship beside the smallest moon of the smallest world? But, there above us, moons, worlds,
suns, all the infinite cluster of colossi, move into place to the exactness of a hair at the
precise instant. That instant has been planned, you see; it is part of a system--and can a
system exist that no mind made? Think of the Mind that made this one! Do you believe so inconceivably
majestic an Intelligence as that could be anything but good? Ah, when you wonder, look above
you; look above you in the night, I say," he cried, his hand upraised like his transfigured
face. "Look above you and you will never fear that a sparrow's fall could go unmarked!"

It was not to the stars that she looked, but to the orator, as long as he held that pose, which
lasted until a hard-ridden horse came galloping down the street. As it dashed by, though the
rider looked neither to right nor left, Miss Betty unconsciously made a feverish clutch at
her companion's sleeve, drawing him closer to the hedge.

"It is my father," she said hurriedly in a low voice. "He must not see you. You must never
come here. Perhaps--" She paused, then quickly whispered: "You have been very kind to me. Good-night."

He looked at her keenly, and through the dimness saw that her face was shining with excitement.
He did not speak again, but, taking a step back-ward, smiled faintly, bent his head in humble
acquiescence, and made a slight gesture of his hand for her to leave him. She set her eyes
upon his once more, then turned swiftly and almost ran along the hedge to the gate; but there
she stopped and looked back. He was standing where she had left him, his face again uplifted
to the sky.

She waved him an uncertain farewell, and ran into the garden, both palms against her burning
cheeks.

Night is the great necromancer, and strange are the fabrics he weaves; he lays queer spells;
breathes so eerie an intoxication through the dusk; he can cast such glamours about a voice!
He is the very king of fairyland.

Miss Betty began to walk rapidly up and down the garden paths, her head bent and her bands
still pressed to her cheeks; now and then an unconscious exclamation burst from her, incoherent,
more like a gasp than a word. A long time she paced the vigil with her stirring heart, her
skirts sweeping the dew from the leaning flowers. Her lips moved often, but only the confused,
vehement "Oh, oh!" came from them, until at last she paused in the middle of the garden, away
from the trees, where all was open to the sparkling firmament, and extended her arms over her head.

"O, strange teacher," she said aloud, "I take your beautiful stars! I shall know how to learn
from them!"

She gazed steadily upward, enrapt, her eyes resplendent with their own starlight.

"Oh, stars, stars, stars!" she whispered.

In the teeth of all wizardry, Night's spells do pass at sunrise; marvellous poems sink to doggerel,
mighty dreams to blown ashes and solids regain weight. Miss Betty, waking at daybreak, saw
the motes dancing in the sun at her window, and watched them with a placid, unremembering eye.
She began to stare at them in a puzzled way, while a look of wonder slowly spread over her
face. Suddenly she sat upright, as though something had startled her. Her fingers clenched tightly.

"Ah, if that was playing!"

CHAPTER VIII. A Tale of a Political Difference

Mr. Carewe was already at the breakfast-table, but the light of his countenance, hidden behind
the Rouen Journal, was not vouchsafed to his daughter when she took her place opposite him,
nor did he see fit to return her morning greeting, from which she generously concluded that
the burning of the two warehouses had meant a severe loss to him.

"I am so sorry, father," she said gently. (She had not called him "papa" since the morning
after her ball.) "I hope it isn't to be a great trouble to you." There was no response, and,
after waiting for some time, she spoke again, rather tremulously, yet not timidly: "Father?"

He rose, and upon his brow were marked the blackest lines of anger she had ever seen, so that
she leaned back from him, startled; but he threw down the open paper before her on the table,
and struck it with his clenched fist.

"Read that!" he said. And he stood over her while she read.

There were some grandiloquent headlines: "Miss Elizabeth Carewe an Angel of Mercy! Charming
Belle Saves the Lives of Five Prominent Citizens! Her Presence of Mind Prevents Conflagration
from Wiping Out the City!" It may be noted that Will Cummings, editor and proprietor of the
Journal, had written these tributes, as well as the whole account of the evening's transactions,
and Miss Betty loomed as large in Will's narrative as in his good and lovelorn heart. There
was very little concerning the fire in the Journal; it was nearly all about Betty. That is
one of the misfortunes which pursue a lady who allows an editor to fall in love with her.

However, there was a scant mention of the arrival of the Volunteers "upon the scene" (though
none at all at the cause of their delay) and an elo-quent paragraph was devoted to their handsome
appearance, Mr. Cummings having been one of those who insisted that the new uniforms should
be worn. "Soon," said the Journal, "through the daring of the Chief of the Department, and
the Captain of the Hook-and-Ladder Company, one of whom placed and mounted the grappling-ladder,
over which he was immediately followed by the other carrying the hose, a stream was sent to
play upon the devouring element, a feat of derring-do personally witnessed by a majority of
our readers. Mr. Vanrevel and Mr. Gray were joined by Eugene Madrillon, Tappingham Marsh, and
the editor of this paper, after which occurred the unfortunate accident to the long ladder,
leaving the five named gentlemen in their terrible predicament, face to face with death in
its most awful form. At this frightful moment "--and all the rest was about Miss Carewe.

As Will himself admitted, he had "laid himself out on that description." One paragraph was
composed of short sentences, each beginning with the word "alone." "Alone she entered the shattered
door! Alone she set foot upon the first flight of stairs! Alone she ascended the second! Alone
she mounted the third. Alone she lifted her hand to the trap! Alone she opened it!" She was
declared to have made her appearance to the unfortunate prisoners on the roof, even as "the
palm-laden dove to the despairing Noah," and Will also asserted repeatedly that she was the
"Heroine of the Hour."

Miss Betty blushed to see her name so blazoned forth in print; but she lacked one kind of vanity,
and failed to find good reason for more than a somewhat troubled laughter, the writer's purpose
was so manifestly kind in spite of the bizarre result.

"Oh, I wish Mr. Cummings hadn't!" she exclaimed. "It would have been better not to speak of
me at all, of course; but I can't see that there is anything to resent--it is so funny!"

"Funny!" Mr. Carewe repeated the word in a cracked falsetto, with the evident intention of
mocking her, and at the same time hideously contorted his face into a grotesque idiocy of expression,
pursing his lips so extremely, and setting his brows so awry, that his other features were
cartooned out of all familiar likeness, effecting an alteration as shocking to behold, in a
man of his severe cast of countenance, as was his falsetto mimicry to hear. She rose in a kind
of terror, perceiving that this contortion was produced in burlesque of her own expression,
and, as he pressed nearer her, stepped back, overturning her chair. She had little recollection
of her father during her childhood; and as long as she could remember, no one had spoken to
her angrily, or even roughly.

As she retreated from him, he leaned forward, thrusting the hideous mask closer to her white
and horror-stricken face.

"You can't see anything to resent in that!" he gibbered. "It's so funny, is it? Funny! Funny!
Funny! I'll show you whether it's funny or not, I'll show you!" His voice rose almost to a
shriek. "You hang around fires, do you, on the public streets at night? You're a nice one for

It was the is, noon. Rate, to pull-at you, string.

Framework, choo-choo. What was an affair?
 The visitor wore a dark-green turban and a Cashmere shawl, while the expanse
of her skirts was nothing short of magnificent: some cathedral-dome seemed to have been misplaced
and the lady dropped into it. Her outstretched hand terrified Betty: how was she to approach
near enough to take it?

Mrs. Tanberry was about sixty, looked forty, and at first you might have guessed she weighed
nearly three hundred, but the lightness of her smile and the actual buoyancy which she somehow
imparted to her whole dominion lessened that by at least a hundred-weight. She ballooned out
to the horse-block with a billowy rush somewhere between bounding and soaring; and Miss Betty
slid down from the colt, who shied violently, to find herself enveloped, in spite of the dome,
in a vast surf of green and red muslin.

"My charming girl!" exclaimed the lady vehemently, in a voice of such husky richness, of such
merriment and unction of delight, that it fell upon Miss Betty's ear with more of the quality
of sheer gayety than any she had ever heard. "Beautiful child! What a beautiful child you are!"

She kissed the girl resoundingly on both cheeks; stepped back from her and laughed, and clapped
her fat hands, which were covered with flashing rings. "Oh, but you are a true blue Beauty!
You're a Princess! I am Mrs. Tanberry, Jane Tanberry, young Janie Tanberry. I haven't seen
you since you were a baby and your pretty mother was a girl like us!"

"You are so kind to come," said Betty hesitatingly. "I shall try to be very obedient."

"Obedient!" Mrs. Tanberry uttered the word with a shriek. "You'll be nothing of the kind. I
am the light-mindedest woman in the universe, and anyone who obeyed me would be embroiled in
everlasting trouble every second in the day. You'll find that I am the one that needs looking
after, my charmer!"

She tapped Miss Betty's cheek with her jeweled fingers as the two mounted the veranda steps.
"It will be worry enough for you to obey yourself; a body sees that at the first blush. You
have conscience in your forehead and rebellion in your chin. Ha, ha, ha!" Here Mrs. Tanberry
sat upon, and obliterated, a large chair, Miss Carewe taking a stool at her knee.

"People of our age oughtn't to be bothered with obeying; there'll be time enough for that when
we get old and can't enjoy anything. Ha, ha!"

Mrs. Tanberry punctuated her observations with short volleys of husky laughter, so abrupt in
both discharge and cessation that, until Miss Betty became accustomed to the habit, she was
apt to start slightly at each salvo. "I had a husband--once," the lady resumed, "but only once,
my friend! He had ideas like your father's--your father is such an imbecile!--and he thought
that wives, sisters, daughters, and such like ought to be obedient: that is, the rest of the
world was wrong unless it was right; and right was just his own little, teeny-squeeny prejudices
and emotions dressed up for a crazy masquerade as Facts. Poor man! He only lasted about a year!"
And Mrs. Tanberry laughed heartily.

"They've been at me time and again to take another." She lowered her voice and leaned toward
Betty confidentially. "Not I! I'd be willing to engage myself to Crailey Gray (though Crailey
hasn't got round to me yet) for I don't mind just being engaged, my dear; but they'll have
to invent something better than a man before I marry any one of 'em again! But I love 'em,
I do, the Charming Billies! And you'll see how they follow me!" She patted the girl's shoulder,
her small eyes beaming quizzically. "We'll have the gayest house in Rouen, ladybird! The young
men all go to the Bareauds', but they'll come here now, and we'll have the Bareauds along with
'em. I've been away a long time, just finished unpacking yesterday night when your father came
in after the fire--Whoo! what a state he was in with that devilish temper of his! Didn't I
snap him up when he asked me to come and stay with you? Ha, ha! I'd have come, even if you
hadn't been beautiful; but I was wild to be your playmate, for I'd heard nothing but 'Miss
Betty Carewe, Miss Betty Carewe' from everybody I saw, since the minute my stage came in. You
set 'em all mad at your ball, and I knew we'd make a glorious house-full, you and I! Some of
the vagabonds will turn up this very evening, you'll see if they don't. Ha, ha! The way they
follow me!"

Mrs. Tanberry was irresistible: she filled the whole place otherwise than by the mere material
voluminousness of her; bubbling over with froth of nonsense which flew through the house, driven
by her energy, like sea-foam on a spring gale; and the day, so discordantly begun for Miss
Betty, grew musical with her own laughter, answering the husky staccato of the vivacious newcomer.
Nelson waited upon them at table, radiant, his smile like the keyboard of an ebony piano, and
his disappearances into the kitchen were accomplished by means of a surreptitious double-shuffle,
and followed by the cachinnating echoes of the vain Mamie's reception of the visitor's sallies,
which Nelson hastily retailed in passing.

Nor was Mrs. Tanberry's prediction allowed to go unfulfilled regarding the advent of those
persons whom she had designated as vagabonds. It may have been out of deference to Mr. Carewe's
sense of decorum (or from a cautious regard of what he was liable to do when he considered
that sense outraged) that the gallants of Rouen had placed themselves under the severe restraint
of allowing three days to elapse after their introduction to Miss Carewe before they "paid
their respects at the house;" but, be that as it may, the dictator was now safely under way
down the Rouen River, and Mrs. Tanberry reigned in his stead. Thus, at about eight o'clock
that evening, the two ladies sat in the library engaged in conversation--though, for the sake
of accuracy, it should be said that Mrs. Tanberry was engaged in conversation, Miss Betty in
giving ear--when their attention was arrested by sounds of a somewhat musical nature from the
lawn, which sounds were immediately identified as emanating from a flute and violin.

Mrs. Tanberry bounded across the room like a public building caught by a cyclone, and, dashing
at the candles, "Blow 'em out, blow 'em out!" she exclaimed, suiting the action to the word
in a fluster of excitement.

"Why?" asked Miss Carewe, startled, as she rose to her feet. The candles were out before the
question.

"'Why!" repeated the merry, husky voice in the darkness. "My goodness, child precious, those
vagabonds are here! To think of your never having been serenaded before!"

She drew the girl to the window and pointed to a group of dim figures near the iliac bushes.
"The dear, delightful vagabonds!" she chuckled. "I knew they'd come! It's the beautiful Tappingham
Marsh with his fiddle, and young Jeff Bareaud with his flute, and 'Gene Madrillon and little
Frank Chenowith and thin Will Cummings to sing. Hark to the rascals!"

It is perfectly truthful to say that the violin and flute executed the prelude, and then the
trio sounded full on the evening air, the more effective chords obligingly drawn out as long
as the breath in the singers could hold them, in order to allow the two fair auditors complete
benefit of the harmony. They sang "The Harp that Once Thro' Tara's Halls," and followed it
with "Long, Long Ago."

"That," Mrs. Tanberry whispered, between stifled gusts of almost uncontrollable laughter, "is
meant for just me!"

"Tell me the tales that to me were so dear," entreated the trio.

"I told 'em plenty!" gurgled the enlivening widow. "And I expect between us we can get up some
more." "Now you are come my grief is removed," they sang.

"They mean your father is on his way to St. Louis," remarked Mrs. Tanberry.

"Let me forget that so long you have roved, Let me believe that you love as you loved, Long,
long ago, long ago."

"Applaud, applaud!" whispered Mrs. Tanberry, encouraging the minstrels by a hearty clapping
of hands.

Hereupon dissension arose among the quintet, evidently a dispute in regard to their next selection;
one of the gentlemen appearing more than merely to suggest a solo by himself, while the others
too frankly expressed adverse opinions upon the value of the offering. The argument became
heated, and in spite of many a "Sh!" and "Not so loud!" the ill-suppressed voice of the intending
soloist, Mr. Chenoweth, could be heard vehemently to exclaim: "I will! I learned it especially
for this occasion. I will sing it!"

His determination, patently, was not to be balked without physical encounter, consequently
he was permitted to advance some paces from the lilac bushes, where he delivered himself, in
an earnest and plaintive tenor, of the following morbid instructions, to which the violin played
an obligato in tremulo, so execrable, and so excruciatingly discordant, that Mr. Chenoweth's
subsequent charge that it was done with a deliberately evil intention could never be successfully
opposed:

     "Go!

Miss Carewe complied at once with the request; while her companion, unable to stop with the
slight expression of pleasure demanded by the songster, threw herself upon a sofa and gave
way to the mirth that consumed her.

Then the candles were relit, the serenaders invited within; Nelson came bearing cake and wine,
and the house was made merry. Presently, the romp, Virginia Bareaud, making her appearance
on the arm of General Trumble, Mrs. Tanberry led them all in a hearty game of Blind-man's Buff,
followed by as hearty a dancing of Dan Tucker. After that, a quadrille being proposed, Mrs.
Tanberry suggested that Jefferson should run home and bring Fanchon for the fourth lady. However,
Virginia explained that she had endeavored to persuade both her sister and Mr. Gray to accompany
the General and herself, but that Mr. Gray had complained of indisposition, having suffered
greatly from headache, on account of inhaling so much smoke at the warehouse fire; and, of
course, Fanchon would not leave him. (Miss Carewe permitted herself the slightest shrug of
the shoulders.)

So they danced the quadrille with Jefferson at the piano and Mr. Marsh performing in the character
of a lady, a proceeding most unacceptable to the General, whom Mrs. Tanberry forced to be his
partner. And thus the evening passed gayly away, and but too quickly, to join the ghosts of
all the other evenings since time began; and each of the little company had added a cheerful
sprite to the long rows of those varied shades that the after years bring to revisit us, so
many with pathetic reproach, so many bearing a tragic burden of faces that we cannot make even
to weep again, and so few with simple merriment and lightheartedness. Tappingham Marsh spoke
the truth, indeed, when he exclaimed in parting, "O rare Mrs. Tanberry!"

But the house had not done with serenades that night. The guests had long since departed; the
windows were still and dark under the wan old moon, which had risen lamely, looking unfamiliar
and not half itself; the air bore an odor of lateness, and nothing moved; when a delicate harmony
stole out of the shadows beyond the misty garden. Low but resonant chords sounded on the heavier
strings of a guitar, while above them, upon the lighter wires, rippled a slender, tinkling
melody that wooed the slumberer to a delicious half-wakefulness, as dreamily, as tenderly,
as the croon of rain on the roof soothes a child to sleep. Under the artist's cunning touch
the instrument was both the accompaniment and the song; and Miss Betty, at first taking the
music to be a wandering thread in the fabric of her own bright dreams, drifted gradually to
consciousness to find herself smiling. Her eyes opened wide, but half closed again with the
ineffable sweetness of the sound.

Then a voice was heard, eerily low, yet gallant and clear, a vibrant baritone, singing to the
guitar.

"My lady's hair, That dark delight, Is both as fair And dusk as night. I know some lovelorn
hearts that beat In time to moonbeam twinklings fleet, That dance and glance like jewels there,
Emblazoning the raven hair!

"Ah, raven hair! So dark and bright, What loves lie there Enmeshed, to-night? I know some sighing
lads that say Their hearts were snared and torn away; And now as pearls one fate they share,
Entangled in the raven hair.

"Ah, raven hair, From such a plight Could you not spare One acolyte? I know a broken heart
that went To serve you but as ornament. Alas! a ruby now you wear, Ensanguining the raven hair!"

The song had grown fainter and fainter, the singer moving away as he sang, and the last lines
were almost inaudible in the distance The guitar could be heard for a moment or two more, then
silence came again. It was broken by a rustling in the room next to Miss Betty's, and Mrs.
Tanberry called softly through the open door:

"Princess, are you awake? Did you hear that serenade?"

After a pause the answer came hesitatingly in a small, faltering voice: "Yes--if it was one.
I thought perhaps he was only singing as he passed along the street."

"Aha!" ejaculated Mrs. Tanberry, abruptly, as though she had made an unexpected discovery.
"You knew better; and this was a serenade that you did not laugh at. Beautiful, I wouldn't
let it go any farther, even while your father is gone. Something might occur that would bring
him home without warning--such things have happened. Tom Vanrevel ought to be kept far away
from this house."

"Oh, it was not he," returned Miss Betty, quickly. "It was Mr. Gray. Didn't you--"

"My dear," interrupted the other, "Crailey Gray's specialty is talking. Most of the vagabonds
can sing and play a bit, and so can Crailey, particularly when he's had a few bowls of punch;
but when Tom Vanrevel touches the guitar and lifts up his voice to sing, there isn't an angel
in heaven that wouldn't quit the place and come to hear him! Crailey wrote those words to Virginia
Bareaud. (Her hair is even darker than yours, you know.) That was when he was being engaged
to her; and Tom must have set the music to 'em lately, and now comes here to sing 'em to you;
and well enough they fit you! But you must keep him away, Princess."

Nevertheless, Betty knew the voice was not that which had bid her look to the stars, and she
remained convinced that it belonged to Mr. Crailey Gray, who had been too ill, a few hours
earlier, to leave the Bareaud house, and now, with Fanchon's kisses on his lips, came stealing
into her garden and sang to her a song he had made for another girl!

And the angels would leave heaven to listen when he sang, would they? Poor Fanchon! No wonder
she held him so tightly in leading strings! He might risk his life all he wished at the end
of a grappling-ladder, dangling in a fiery cloud above nothing; but when it came to--ah, well,
poor Fanchon! Did she invent the headaches for him, or did she make him invent them for himself?

If there was one person in the world whom Miss Betty held in bitter contempt and scorn, it
was the owner of that voice and that guitar.

CHAPTER X. Echoes of a Serenade

More than three gentlemen of Rouen wore their hearts in their eyes for any fool to gaze upon;
but three was the number of those who told their love before the end of the first week of Mr.
Carewe's absence, and told it in spite of Mrs. Tanberry's utmost effort to preserve, at all
times, a conjunction between herself and Miss Betty. For the good lady, foreseeing these declarations
much more surely than did the subject of them, wished to spare her lovely charge the pain of
listening to them.

Miss Carewe honored each of the lorn three with few minutes of gravity; but the gentle refusal
prevented never a swain from being as truly her follower as before; not that she resorted to
the poor device of half-dismissal, the every-day method of the school-girl flirt, who thus
keeps the lads in dalliance, but because, even for the rejected, it was a delight to be near
her. For that matter, it is said that no one ever had enough of the mere looking at her. Also,
her talk was enlivening even to the lively, being spiced with surprising turns and amiably
seasoned with the art of badinage. To use the phrase of the time, she possessed the accomplishments,
an antiquated charm now on the point of disappearing, so carefully has it been snubbed under
whenever exhibited. The pursuing wraith of the young, it comes to sit, a ghost at every banquet,
driving the flower of our youth to unheard-of exertions in search of escape, to dubious diplomacy,
to dismal inaction, or to wine; yet time was when they set their hearts on "the accomplishments."

Miss Betty Carewe at her harp, ah! it was a dainty picture: the clear profile, with the dark
hair low across the temple, silhouetted duskily, in the cool, shadowy room, against the open
window; the slender figure, one arm curving between you and the strings, the other gleaming
behind them; the delicate little sandal stealing from the white froth of silk and lace to caress
the pedal; the nimble hands fluttering across the long strands, "Like white blossoms borne
on slanting lines of rain;" and the great gold harp rising to catch a javelin of sunshine that
pierced the vines at the window where the honeysuckles swung their skirts to the refrain--it
was a picture to return many a long year afterward, and thrill the reveries of old men who
were then young. And, following the light cascading ripples of the harp, when her low contralto
lifted in one of the "old songs," she often turned inquiringly to see if the listener liked
the music, and her brilliant, dark eyes would rest on his with an appeal that blinded his entranced
soul. She meant it for the mere indication of a friendly wish to suit his tastes, but it looked
like the divine humility of love. Nobody wondered that General Trumble should fall to verse-making
in his old age.

She sketched magnificently. This is the very strongest support for the assertion: Frank Chenoweth
and Tappingham Marsh agreed, with tears of enthusiasm, that "magnificently" was the only word.
They came to this conclusion as they sat together at the end of a long dinner (at which very
little had been eaten) after a day's picnic by the river. Miss Carewe had been of their company,
and Tappingham and Chenoweth found each his opportunity in the afternoon. The party was small,
and no one had been able to effect a total unconsciousness of the maneuvers of the two gentle-men.
Even Fanchon Bareaud comprehended languidly, though she was more blurred than ever, and her
far-away eyes belied the mechanical vivacity of her manner, for Crailey was thirty miles down
the river, with a fishing-rod neatly packed in a leather case.

Mr. Vanrevel, of course, was not invited; no one would have thought of asking him to join a
small party of which Robert Carewe's daughter was to be a member. But it was happiness enough
for Tom, that night, to lie hidden in the shrubbery, looking up at the stars between the leaves,
while he listened to her harp, and borne through the open window on enchanted airs, the voice
of Elizabeth Carewe singing "Robin Adair."

It was now that the town indulged its liveliest spirit; never an evening lacked its junketing,
while the happy folk of Rouen set the early summer to music. Serenade, dance, and song for
them, the light-hearts, young and old making gay together! It was all laughter, either in sunshine
or by candlelight, undisturbed by the far thunder below the southern horizon, where Zachary
Taylor had pitched his tent, upon the Rio Grande.

One fair evening, soon after that excursion which had proved fatal to the hopes of the handsome
Tappingham and of the youthful Chenoweth, it was the privilege of Mr. Thomas Vanrevel to assist
Miss Carewe and her chaperon from their carriage, as they drove up to a dance at the Bareauds'.
This good fortune fell only to great deserving, for he had spent an hour lurking outside the
house in the hope of performing such offices for them.

Heaven was in his soul and the breath departed out of his body, when, after a moment of hesitation,
Miss Betty's little lace-gauntleted glove was placed in his hand, and her white slipper shimmered
out from the lilac flounces of her dress to fall like a benediction, he thought, on each of
the carriage-steps.

It was the age of garlands; they wreathed the Muses, the Seasons, and their speech, so the
women wore wreaths in their hair, and Miss Betty's that night was of marguerites. "Read your
fortune in them all," whispered Tom's heart, "and of whomsoever you wish to learn, every petal
will say 'He loves you; none declare, He loves you not!'"

She bowed slightly, but did not speak to him, which was perhaps a better reception than that
accorded the young man by her companion. "Oh, it's you, is it!" was Mrs. Tanberry's courteous
observation as she canted the vehicle in her descent. She looked sharply at Miss Betty, and
even the small glow of the carriage-lamps showed that the girl's cheeks had flushed very red.
Mr. Vanrevel, on the contrary, was pale.

They stood for a moment in awkward silence, while, from the lighted house where the flying
figures circled, came the waltz: "I dreamt that I dwe-helt in ma-har-ble halls." Tom's own
dreams were much wilder than the gypsy girl's; he knew that; yet he spoke out bravely:

"Will you dance the two first with me?"

Miss Betty bit her lip, frowned, turned away, and, vouchsafing no reply, walked toward the
house with her eyes fixed on the ground; but just as they reached the door she flashed over
him a look that scorched him from head to foot, and sent his spirits down through the soles
of his boots to excavate a grotto in the depths of the earth, so charged it was with wrathful
pity and contempt.

"Yes!" she said abruptly, and followed Mrs. Tanberry to the dressing-room.

The elder lady shook her head solemnly as she emerged from the enormous folds of a yellow silk
cloak. "Ah, Princess," she said, touching the girl's shoulder with her jeweled hand, "I told
you I was a very foolish woman, and I am, but not so foolish as to offer advice often. Yet,
believe me, it won't do. I think that is one of the greatest young men I ever knew, and it's
a pity--but it won't do."

Miss Betty kept her face away from her guardian for a moment. No inconsiderable amount of information
had drifted to her, from here and there, regarding the career of Crailey Gray, and she thought
how intensely she would have hated any person in the world except Mrs. Tanberry for presuming
to think she needed to be warned against the charms of this serenading lady-killer, who was
the property of another girl.

"You must keep him away, I think," ventured Mrs. Tanberry, gently.

At that Betty turned to her and said, sharply:

"I will. After this, please let us never speak of him again."

A slow nod of the other's turbaned head indicated the gravest acquiescence. She saw that her
companion's cheeks were still crimson. "I understand," said she.

A buzz of whispering, like a July beetle, followed Miss Carewe and her partner about the room
during the next dance. How had Tom managed it? Had her father never told her? Who had dared
to introduce them? Fanchon was the only one who knew, and as she whirled by with Will Cummings,
she raised her absent glance long enough to give Tom an affectionate and warning shake of the head.

Tom did not see this; Miss Carewe did. Alas! She smiled upon him instantly and looked deep
into his eyes. It was the third time.

She was not afraid of this man-flirt; he was to be settled with once and forever. She intended
to avenge both Fanchon and herself; yet it is a hazardous game, this piercing of eye with eye,
because the point which seeks to penetrate may soften and melt, leaving one defenseless. For
perhaps ten seconds that straight look lasted, while it seemed to her that she read clear into
the soul of him, and to behold it, through some befooling magic, as strong, tender, wise, and
true, as his outward appearance would have made an innocent stranger believe him; for he looked
all these things; she admitted that much; and he had an air of distinction and resource beyond
any she had ever known, even in the wild scramble for her kitten he had not lost it. So, for
ten seconds, which may be a long time, she saw a man such as she had dreamed, and she did not
believe her sight, because she had no desire to be as credulous as the others, to be as easily
cheated as that poor Fanchon!

The luckless Tom found his own feet beautiful on the mountains, and, treading the heights with
airy steps, appeared to himself wonderful and glorified--he was waltzing with Miss Betty He
breathed the entrancing words to himself, over and over: it was true, he was waltzing with
Miss Betty Carewe! Her glove lay warm and light within his own; his fingers clasped that ineffable
lilac and white brocade waist. Sometimes her hair came within an inch of his cheek, and then
he rose outright from the hilltops and floated in a golden mist. The glamour of which the Incroyable
had planned to tell her some day, surrounded Tom, and it seemed to him that the whole world
was covered with a beautiful light like a carpet, which was but the radiance of this adorable
girl whom his gloves and coat-sleeve were permitted to touch. When the music stopped, they
followed in the train of other couples seeking the coolness of out-of-doors for the interval,
and Tom, in his soul, laughed at all other men with illimitable condescension.

"Stop here," she said, as they reached the open gate. He was walking out of it, his head in
the air, and Miss Betty on his arm. Apparently, he would have walked straight across the State.
It was the happiest moment he had ever known.

He wanted to say something wonderful to her; his speech should be like the music and glory
and lire that was in him; therefore he was shocked to hear himself remarking, with an inanity
of utterance that sickened him:

"Oh, here's the gate, isn't it?"

Her answer was a short laugh. "You mean you wish to persuade me that you had forgotten it was
there?"

"I did not see it," he protested, lamentably.

"No?"

"I wasn't thinking of it."

"Indeed! You were 'lost in thoughts of '--"

"Of you!" he said, before he could check himself.

"Yes?" Her tone was as quietly contemptuous as she could make it. "How very frank of you! May
I ask: Are you convinced that speeches of that sort are always to a lady's liking?"

"No," he answered humbly, and hung his head. Then she threw the question at him abruptly:

"Was it you who came to sing in our garden?"

There was a long pause before a profound sigh came tremulously from the darkness, like a sad
and tender confession. "Yes."

"I thought so!" she exclaimed. "Mrs. Tanberry thought it was someone else; but I knew that
it was you."

"Yes, you are right," he said, quietly. "It was I. It was my only way to tell you what you
know now."

"Of course!" She set it all aside with those two words and the slightest gesture of her hand.
"It was a song made for another girl, I believe?" she asked lightly, and with an icy smile,
inquired farther: "For the one--the one before the last, I understand?"

He lifted his head, surprised. "What has that to do with it? The music was made for you--but
then, I think all music was made for you."

"Leave the music out of it, if you please," she said, impatiently. "Your talents make you modest!
No doubt you consider it unmaidenly in me to have referred to the serenade before you spoke
of it; but I am not one to cast down my eyes and let it pass. No, nor one too sweet to face
the truth, either!" she cried with sudden passion. "To sing that song in the way you did, meant--oh,
you thought I would flirt with you! What right had you to come with such a song to me?"

Tom intended only to disclaim the presumption, so far from his thoughts, that his song had
moved her, for he could see that her attack was prompted by her inexplicable impression that
he had assumed the attitude of a conqueror, but his explanation began unfortunately.

"Forgive me. I think you have completely misunderstood; you thought it meant something I did
not intend, at all, and--"

"What!" she said, and her eyes blazed, for now she beheld him as the arrant sneak of the world.
He, the lady-killer, with his hypocritical air of strength and melancholy sweetness, the leader
of drunken revels, and, by reputation, the town Lothario and Light-o'-Love, under promise of
marriage to Fanchon Bareaud, had tried to make love to another girl, and now his cowardice
in trying to disclaim what he had done lent him the insolence to say to this other: "My child,
you are betrayed by your youth and conceit; you exaggerate my meaning. I had no intention to
distinguish you by coquetting with you!" This was her interpretation of him; and her indignation
was not lessened by the inevitable conclusion that he, who had been through so many scenes
with women, secretly found her simplicity diverting. Miss Betty had a little of her father
in her; while it was part of her youth, too, that, of all things she could least endure the
shadow of a smile at her own expense.

"Oh, oh!" she cried, her voice shaking with anger. "I suppose your bad heart is half-choked
with your laughter at me."

She turned from him swiftly, and left him.

Almost running, she entered the house, and hurried to a seat by Mrs. Tanberry, nestling to
her like a young sapling on a hillside. Instantaneously, several gentlemen, who had hastily
acquitted themselves of various obligations in order to seek her, sprang forward with eager
greetings, so that when the stricken Tom, dazed and confounded by his evil luck, followed her
at about five paces, he found himself confronted by an impenetrable abbatis formed by the spiked
tails of the coats of General Trumble, Madrillon, Tappingham Marsh, Cummings and Jefferson
Bareaud. Within this fortification rang out laughter and sally from Miss Carewe; her color
was high and her eyes sparkled never more brightly.

Flourish and alarums sounded for a quadrille. Each of the semi-circle, firmly elbowing his
neighbor, begged the dance of Miss Betty; but Tom was himself again, and laid a long, strong
hand on Madrillon's shoulder, pressed him gently aside, and said:

"Forgive me; Miss Carewe has honored me by the promise of this quadrille."

He bowed, offering his arm, and none of them was too vain to envy that bow and gesture.

For a moment he remained waiting. Miss Carewe rose slowly, and, directly facing him, said in
composed and even voice: "You force me to beg you never to address me again."

She placed her hand on the General's arm, turning her back squarely upon Tom.

In addition to those who heard, many persons in that part of the room saw the affront and paused
in arrested attitudes; others, observing these, turned inquiringly, so that sudden silence
fell, broken only by the voice of Miss Betty as she moved away, talking cheerily to the General.
Tom was left standing alone in the broken semicircle.

All the eyes swept from her to him and back; then everyone began to talk hastily about nothing.
The young man's humiliation was public.

He went to the door under cover of the movement of the various couples to find places in the
quadrille, yet every sidelong glance in the room still rested upon him, and he knew it. He
remained in the ball, alone, through that dance, and at its conclusion, walked slowly through
the rooms, speaking to people, here and there, as though nothing had happened, but when the
music sounded again, he went to the dressing-room, found his hat and cloak, and left the house.
For a while he stood on the opposite side of the street, watching the lighted windows, and
twice he caught sight of the lilac and white brocade, the dark hair, and the wreath of marguerites.
Then, with a hot pain in his breast, and the step of a Grenadier, he marched down the street.

In the carriage Mrs. Tanberry took Betty's hand in hers. "I'll do as you wish, child," she
said, "and never speak to you of him again as long as I live, except this once. I think it
was best for his own sake as well as yours, but--"

"He needed a lesson," interrupted Miss Betty, wearily. She had danced long and hard, and she
was very tired.

Mrs. Tanberry's staccato laugh came out irrepressibly. "All the vagabonds do, Princess!" she
cried. "And I think they are getting it."

"No, no, I don't mean--"

"We've turned their heads, my dear, between us, you and I; and we'll have to turn 'em again,
or they'll break their necks looking over their shoulders at us, the owls!" She pressed the
girl's hand affectionately. "But you'll let me say something just once, and forgive me because
we're the same foolish age, you know. It's only this: The next young man you suppress, take
him off in a corner! Lead him away from the crowd where he won't have to stand and let them
look at him afterward. That's all, my dear, and you mustn't mind."

"I'm not sorry!" said Miss Betty hotly. "I'm not sorry!"

"No, no," said Mrs. Tanberry, soothingly. "It was better this time to do just what you did.
I'd have done it myself, to make quite sure he would keep away--because I like him."

"I'm not sorry!" said Miss Betty again.

"I'm not sorry!" she repeated and reiterated to herself after Mrs. Tanberry had gone to bed.
She had sunk into a chair in the library with a book, and "I'm not sorry!" she whispered as
the open unread page blurred before her, "I'm not sorry!" He had needed his lesson; but she
had to bear the recollection of how white his face went when he received it. Her affront had
put about him a strange loneliness: the one figure with the stilled crowd staring; it had made
a picture from which her mind's eye had been unable to escape, danced she never so hard and
late. Unconsciously, Robert Carewe's daughter had avenged the other figure which had stood
in lonely humiliation before the staring eyes.

"I'm not sorry!" Ah, did they think it was in her to hurt any living thing in the world? The
book dropped from her lap, and she bowed her head upon her hands. "I'm not sorry! "--and tears
upon the small lace gauntlets!

She saw them, and with an incoherent exclamation, half self-pitying, half impatient, ran out
to the stars above her garden.

She was there for perhaps half an hour, and just before she returned to the house she did a
singular thing.

Standing where all was clear to the sky, where she had stood after her talk with the Incroyable,
when he had bid her look to the stars, she raised her arms to them again, her face, pale with
a great tenderness, uplifted.

"You, you, you!" she whispered. "I love you!"

And yet it was to nothing definite, to no man, nor outline of a man, to no phantom nor dream-lover,
that she spoke; neither to him she had affronted, nor to him who had bidden her look to the
stars. Nor was it to the stars themselves.

She returned slowly and thoughtfully to the house, wondering what she had meant.

CHAPTER XI. A Voice in a Garden

Crailey came home the next day with a new poem, but no fish. He lounged up the stairs, late
in the afternoon, humming cheerfully to himself, and, dropping his rod in a corner of Tom's
office, laid the poem on the desk before his partner, produced a large, newly-replenished flask,
opened it, stretched himself comfortably upon a capacious horse-hair sofa, drank a deep draught,
chuckled softly, and requested Mr. Vanrevel to set the rhymes to music immediately.

"Try it on your instrument," he said. "It's a simple verse about nothing but stars, and you
can work it out in twenty minutes with the guitar."

"It is broken," said Tom, not looking up from his work.

"Broken! When?"

"Last night."

"Who broke it?"

"It fell from the table in my room."

"How? Easily mended, isn't it?"

"I think I shall not play it soon again."

Crailey swung his long legs off the sofa and abruptly sat upright. "What's this?" he asked gravely.

Tom pushed his papers away from him, rose and went to the dusty window that looked to the west,
where, at the end of the long street, the sun was setting behind the ruin of charred timbers
on the bank of the shining river.

"It seems that I played once too often," he said.

Crailey was thoroughly astonished. He took a long, affectionate pull at the flask and offered
it to his partner.

"No," said Tom, turning to him with a troubled face, "and if I were you, I wouldn't either.
These fishing trips of yours--"

"Fishing!" Crailey laughed. "Trips of a poetaster! It's then I write best, and write I will!
There's a poem, and a damned good one, too, old preacher, in every gill of whiskey, and I'm
the lad that can extract it! Lord! what's better than to be out in the open, all by yourself
in the woods, or on the river? Think of the long nights alone with the glory of heaven and
a good demijohn. Why, a man's thoughts are like actors performing in the air and all the crowding
stars for audience! You know in your soul you'd rather have me out there, going it all by myself,
than raising thunder over town. And you know, too, it doesn't tell on me; it doesn't show!
You couldn't guess, to save your life, how much I've had to-day, now, could you?"

"Yes," returned the other, "I could."

"Well, well," said Crailey, good-naturedly, "we weren't talking of me." He set down the flask,
went to his friend and dropped a hand lightly on his shoulder. "What made you break the guitar?
Tell me."

"What makes you think I broke it?" asked his partner sharply.

"Tell me why you did it," said Crailey.

And Tom, pacing the room, told him, while Crailey stood in silence, looking him eagerly in
the eye whenever Tom turned his way. The listener interrupted seldom; once it was to exclaim:
"But you haven't said why you broke the guitar?"

"'If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out!' I ought to have cut off the hands that played to her."

"And cut your throat for singing to her?"

"She was right!" the other answered, striding up and down the room. "Right--a thousand times!
in everything she did. That I should even ap-proach her, was an unspeakable insolence. I had
forgotten, and so, possibly, had she, but I had not even been properly introduced to her."

"No, you hadn't, that's true," observed Crailey, reflectively. "You don't seem to have much
to reproach her with, Tom."

"Reproach her!" cried the other. "That I should dream she would speak to me or have anything
to do with me, was to cast a doubt upon her loyalty as a daughter. She was right, I say! And
she did the only thing she could do: rebuked me before them all. No one ever merited what he
got more roundly than I deserved that. Who was I, in her eyes, that I should besiege her with
my importunities, who but her father's worst enemy?"

Deep anxiety knitted Crailey's brow. "I understood she knew of the quarrel," he said, thoughtfully.
"I saw that, the other evening when I helped her out of the crowd. She spoke of it on the way
home, I remember; but how did she know that you were Vanrevel? No one in town would be apt
to mention you to her."

"No, but she did know, you see."

"Yes," returned Mr. Gray slowly. "So it seems! Probably her father told her to avoid you, and
described you so that she recognized you as the man who caught the kitten."

He paused, picked up the flask, and again applied himself to its contents, his eyes peering
over the up-tilted vessel at Tom, who continued to pace up and down the length of the office.
After a time, Crailey, fumbling in his coat, found a long cheroot, and, as he lit it, inquired
casually:

"Do you remember if she addressed you by name?"

"I think not," Tom answered, halting. "What does it matter?"

Crailey drew a deep breath.

"It doesn't," he returned.

"She knew me well enough," said Tom, sadly, as he resumed his sentry-go.

"Yes," repeated Crailey, deliberately. "So it seems; so it seems!" He blew a long stream of
smoke out into the air before him, and softly mur-mured again: "So it seems, so it seems."

Silence fell, broken only by the sound of Tom's footsteps, until, presently, some one informally
shouted his name from the street below. It was only Will Cummings, passing the time of day,
but when Tom turned from the window after answering him, Crailey, his poem, and his flask were
gone.

That evening Vanrevel sat in the dusty office, driving himself to his work with a sharp goad,
for there was a face that came between him and all else in the world, and a voice that sounded
always in his ears. But the work was done before he rose from his chair, though he showed a
haggard visage as he bent above his candles to blow them out.

It was eleven o'clock; Crailey had not come back, and Tom knew that his light-hearted friend
would not return for many hours; and so, having no mind to read, and no belief that he could
if he tried, he went out to walk the streets. He went down to the river first, and stood for
a little while gazing at the ruins of the two warehouses, and that was like a man with a headache
beating his skull against a wall. As he stood on the blackened wharf, he saw how the charred
beams rose above him against the sky like a gallows, and it seemed to him that nothing could
have been a better symbol, for here he had hanged his self-respect. "Reproach her!" He, who
had so displayed his imbecility before her! Had he been her father's best friend, he should
have had too great a sense of shame to dare to speak to her after that night when her quiet
intelligence had exhibited him to himself, and to all the world, as nought else than a fool--and
a noisy one at that!

Suddenly a shudder convulsed him; he struck his open palm across his forehead and spoke aloud,
while, from horizon to horizon, the night air grew thick with the whispered laughter of observing
hobgoblins:

"And even if there had been no stairway, we could have slid down the hose-line!"

He retraced his steps, a tall, gray figure moving slowly through the blue darkness, and his
lips formed the heart-sick shadow of a smile when he found that he had unconsciously turned
into Carewe Street. Presently he came to a gap in a hedge, through which he had sometimes stolen
to hear the sound of a harp and a girl's voice singing; but he did not enter there tonight,
though he paused a moment, his head bowed on his breast.

There came a sound of voices; they seemed to be moving toward the hedge, toward the gap where
he stood; one a man's eager, quick, but very musical; the other, a girl's, a rich and clear
contralto that passed into Tom's soul like a psalm of rejoicing and like a scimitar of flame.
He shivered, and moved away quickly, but not before the man's voice, somewhat louder for the
moment, came distinctly from the other side of the hedge:

"After all," said the voice, with a ripple of laughter, "after all, weren't you a little hard
on that poor Mr. Gray?"

Tom did not understand, but he knew the voice. It was that of Crailey Gray.

He heard the same voice again that night, and again stood unseen. Long after midnight he was
still tramping the streets on his lonely rounds, when he chanced to pass the Rouen House, which
hostelry bore, to the uninitiated eye, the appearance of having closed its doors upon all hospitalities
for the night, in strict compliance with the law of the city fathers, yet a slender wand of
bright light might be discovered underneath the street door of the bar-room.

room. Presently the latter ceased to be heard, and a wooden moan of protest from the four-poster
upon which the good lady reposed, announced that she had drawn the curtains and wooed the rulers
of Nod.

Although it was one of those nights of which they say, "It is a good night to sleep," Miss
Betty was not drowsy. She had half-unfastened one small sandal, but she tied the ribbons again,
and seated herself by the open window. The ledge and casement framed a dim oblong of thin light
from the candles behind her, a lonely lustre, which crossed the veranda to melt shapelessly
into darkness on the soggy lawn. She felt a melancholy in the softly falling rain and wet,
black foliage that chimed with the sadness of her own spirit. The night suited her very well,
for her father's coming had brought a weight of depression with it. Why could he not have spoken
one word to her, even a cross one? She knew that he did not love her, yet, merely as a fellow-being,
she was entitled to a measure of courtesy; and the fact that she was his daughter could not
excuse his failure to render it. Was she to continue to live with him on their present terms?
She had no intention to make another effort to alter them; but to remain as they were would
be intolerable, and Mrs. Tanberry could not stay forever, to act as a buffer between her and
her father. Peering out into the dismal night, she found her own future as black, and it seemed
no wonder that the Sisters loved the convent life; that the pale nuns forsook the world wherein
there was so much useless unkindness; where women were petty and jealous, like that cowardly
Fanchon, and men who looked great were tricksters, like Fanchon's betrothed. In Vera August, 1860,

Pulszky for Magyarorszag, where will wish how he become Meaning to

Before therefore leaving England, Kossuth said himself to Crailey
his the "reading" of character of Cards.


She pressed her fingers to her forehead, trying to untangle the maze of dreams which had evolved
this shock for her, the sudden clamor in her father's voice of a name she hated and hoped never
to hear again, a name she was trying to forget. But as she was unable to trace anything which
had led to it, there remained only the conclusion that her nerves were not what they should
be. The vapors having become obsolete for young ladies as an explanation for all unpleasant
sensations, they were instructed to have "nerves." This was Miss Betty's first consciousness
of her own, and, desiring no greater acquaintance with them, she told herself it was unwholesome
to fall asleep in a chair by an open window when the night was as sad as she.

Turning to a chair in front of the small oval mirror of her bureau, she unclasped the brooch
which held her lace collar, and, seating herself, began to unfasten her hair. Suddenly she
paused, her uplifted arms falling mechanically to her sides.

Someone was coming through the long hall with a soft, almost inaudible step, a step which was
not her father's. She knew at once, with instinctive certainty, that it was not he. Nor was
it Nelson, who would have shuffled; nor could it be the vain Mamie, nor one of the other servants,
for they did not sleep in the house. It was a step more like a woman's, though certainly it
was not Mrs. Tanberry's.

Betty rose, took a candle, and stood silent for a moment, the heavy tresses of her hair, half-unloosed,
falling upon her neck and left shoulder like the folds of a dark drapery.

At the slight rustle of her rising, the steps ceased instantly. Her heart set up a wild beating
and the candle shook in her hand. But she was brave and young, and, following an irresistible
impulse, she ran across the room, flung open the door, and threw the light of the candle into
the hall, holding it at arm's length before her.

She came almost face to face with Crailey Gray.

The blood went from his cheeks as a swallow flies down from a roof; he started back against
the opposite wall with a stifled groan, while she stared at him blankly, and grew as deathly
pale as he.

He was a man of great resource in all emergencies which required a quick tongue, but, for the
moment, this was beyond him. He felt himself lost, toppling backward into an abyss, and the
uselessness of his destruction made him physically sick. For he need not have been there; he
had not wished to come; he had well counted the danger to himself, and this one time in his
life had gone to the cupola-room out of good-nature. But Bareaud had been obstinate and Crailey
had come away alone, hoping that Jefferson might follow. And here he was, poor trapped rat,
convicted and ruined because of a good action! At last he knew consistency to be a jewel, and
that a greedy boy should never give a crust; that a fool should stick to his folly, a villain
to his deviltry, and each hold his own; for the man who thrusts a good deed into a life of
lies is wound about with perilous passes, and in his devious ways a thousand unexpected damnations
spring.

Beaten, stunned, hang-jawed with despair, he returned her long, dumfounded gaze hopelessly
and told the truth like an inspired dunce.

"I came--I came--to bring another man away," he whispered brokenly; and, at the very moment,
several heavy, half-suppressed voices broke into eager talk overhead.

The white hand that held the candle wavered, and the shadows glided in a huge, grotesque dance.
Twice she essayed to speak before she could do so, at the same moment motioning him back, for
he had made a vague gesture toward her.

"I am not faint. Do you mean, away from up there?" She pointed to the cupola-stairs.

"Yes."

"Have-have you seen my father?"

The question came out of such a depth of incredulousness that it was more an articulation of
the lips than a sound, but he caught it; and, with it not hope, but the shadow of a shadow
of hope, a hand waving from the far shore to the swimmer who has been down twice. Did she fear
for his sake?

"No--I have not seen him." He was groping blindly.

"You did not come from that"

"How did you enter the house?"

The draught through the hall was blowing upon him; the double doors upon the veranda had been
left open for coolness. "There," he said, pointing to them.

"But--I heard you come from the other direction."

He was breathing quickly; he saw his chance--if Jefferson Bareaud did not come now.

"You did not hear me come down the stairs." He leaned toward her, risking it all on that.

"Ah!" A sigh too like a gasp burst from Crailey. His head lifted a little, and his eyes were
luminous with an eagerness that was almost anguish. He set his utmost will at work to collect
himself and to think hard and fast.

"I came here resolved to take a man away, come what would!" he said. "I found the door open,
went to the foot of that stairway; then I stopped. I remembered something; I turned, and was
going away when you opened the door."

"You remembered what?"

Her strained attitude did not relax, nor, to his utmost scrutiny, was the complete astonishment
of her distended gaze altered one whit, but a hint of her accustomed high color was again upon
her cheek and her lip trembled a little, like that of a child about to weep. The flicker of
hope in his breast increased prodigiously, and the rush of it took the breath from his throat
and choked him. Good God! was she going to believe him?

"I remembered--you!"

"What?" she said, wonderingly.

Art returned with a splendid bound, full-pinioned, his beautiful and treacherous Familiar who
had deserted him at the crucial instant; but she made up for it now, folding him in protective
wings and breathing through his spirit. In rapid and vehement whispers he poured out the words
upon the girl in the doorway.

"I have a friend, and I would lay down my life to make him what he could be. He has always
thrown everything away, his life, his talents, all his money and all of mine, for the sake
of--throwing them away! Some other must tell you about that room; but it has ruined my friend.
Tonight I discovered that he had been summoned here, and I made up my mind to come and take
him away. Your father has sworn to shoot me if I set foot in his house or on ground of his.
Well, my duty was clear and I came to do it. And yet--I stopped at the foot of the stair--because--because
I remembered that you were Robert Carewe's daughter. What of you, if I went up and harm came
to me from your father? For I swear I would not have touched him! You asked me not to speak
of 'personal' things, and I have obeyed you; but you see I must tell you one thing now: I have
cared for this friend of mine more than for all else under heaven, but I turned and left him
to his ruin, and would a thousand times, rather than bring trouble upon you! 'A thousand times?'
Ah! I swear it should be a thousand times a thousand!"

He had paraded in one speech from the prisoner's dock to Capulet's garden, and her eyes were
shining into his like a great light when he finished.

"Go quickly," she whispered. "Go quickly! Go quickly!"

"But do you understand?"

"Not yet, but I shall. Will you go? They might come-my father might come-at any moment."

"But---"

"Do you want to drive me quite mad? Please go!" She laid a trembling, urgent hand upon his sleeve.

"Never, until you tell me that you understand," replied Crailey firmly, listening keenly for
the slightest sound from overhead. "Never--until then!"

"When I do I shall tell you; now I only know that you must go."

"But tell me--"

"You must go!"

There was a shuffling of chairs on the floor overhead, and Crailey went. He went even more
hastily than might have been expected from the adaman-tine attitude he had just previously
assumed. Realizing this as he reached the wet path, he risked stealing round to her window:

"For your sake!" he breathed; and having thus forestalled any trifling imperfection which might
arise in her recollection of his exit from the house, he disappeared, kissing his hand to the
rain as he ran down the street.

Miss Betty locked her door and pulled close the curtains of her window. A numerous but careful
sound of footsteps came from the hall, went by her door and out across the veranda. Silently
she waited until she heard her father go alone to his room.

She took the candle and went in to Mrs. Tanberry. She set the light upon a table, pulled a
chair close to the bedside, and placed her cool hand lightly on the great lady's forehead.

"Isn't it very late, child? Why are you not asleep?"

"Mrs. Tanberry, I want to know why there was a light in the cupola-room tonight?"

"What?" Mrs. Tanberry rolled herself as upright as possible, and sat with blinking eyes.

"I want to know what I am sure you know, and what I am sure everybody knows, except me. What
were they doing there tonight, and what was the quarrel between Mr. Vanrevel and my father
that had to do with Mr. Gray?"

Mrs. Tanberry gazed earnestly into the girl's face. After a long time she said in a gentle voice:

"Child, has it come to matter that much?"

"Yes," said Miss Betty.

CHAPTER XIII. The Tocsin

Tom Vanrevel always went to the post-office soon after the morning distribution of the mail;
that is to say, about ten o'clock, and returned with the letters for the firm of Gray and Vanrevel,
both personal and official. Crailey and he shared everything, even a box at the post-office;
and in front of this box, one morning, after a night of rain, Tom stood staring at a white
envelope bearing a small, black seal. The address was in a writing he had never seen before,
but the instant it fell under his eye he was struck with a distinctly pleasurable excitement.

Whether through some spiritual exhalation of the writer fragrant on any missive, or because
of a hundred microscopic impressions, there are analysts who are able to select, from a pile
of letters written by women (for the writing of women exhibits certain phenomena more determinably
than that of men) those of the prettiest or otherwise most attractive. And out upon the lover
who does not recognize his mistress's hand at the first glimpse ever he has of it, without
post-mark or other information to aid him! Thus Vanrevel, worn, hollow-eyed, and sallow, in
the Rouen post-office, held the one letter separate from a dozen (the latter not, indeed, from
women), and stared at it until a little color came back to his dark skin and a great deal of
brightness to his eye. He was no analyst of handwritings, yet it came to him instantly that
this note was from a pretty woman. To see that it was from a woman was simple, but that he
knew--and he did know--that she was pretty, savors of the occult. More than this: there was
something about it that thrilled him. Suddenly, and without reason, he knew that it came from
Elizabeth Carewe.

He walked back quickly to his office with the letter in the left pocket of his coat, threw
the bundle of general correspondence upon his desk, went up to the floor above, and paused
at his own door to listen. Deep breathing from across the hall indicated that Mr. Gray's soul
was still encased in slumber, and great was its need, as Tom had found his partner, that morning
at five, stretched upon the horsehair sofa in the office, lamenting the emptiness of a bottle
which had been filled with fiery Bourbon in the afternoon.

Vanrevel went to his own room, locked the door, and took the letter from his pocket. He held
it between his fingers carefully, as though it were alive and very fragile, and he looked at
it a long time, holding it first in one hand, then in the other, before he opened it. At last,
however, after examining all the blades of his pocketknife, he selected one brighter than the
others, and loosened the flap of the envelope as gently and carefully as if it had been the
petal of a rose-bud that he was opening.

"Dear Mr. Vanrevel:

"I believed you last night, though I did not understand. But I understand, now--everything--and,
bitter to me as the truth is, I must show you plainly that I know all of it, nor can I rest
until I do show you. I want you to answer this letter--though I must not see you again for
a long time--and in your answer you must set me right if I am anywhere mistaken in what I have
learned.

"At first, and until after the second time we met, I did not believe in your heart, though
I did in your mind and humor. Even since then, there have come strange, small, inexplicable
mistrustings of you, but now I throw them all away and trust you wholly, Monsieur Citizen Georges
Meilbac!--I shall always think of you in those impossible garnishments of my poor great-uncle,
and I persuade myself that he must have been a little like you.

"I trust you because I have heard the story of your profound goodness. The first reason for
my father's dislike was your belief in freedom as the right of all men. Ah, it is not your
pretty exaggerations and flatteries (I laugh at them!) that speak for you, but your career,
itself, and the brave things you have done. My father's dislike flared into hatred because
you worsted him when he discovered that he could not successfully defend the wrong against
you and fell back upon sheer insult.

"He is a man whom I do not know--strange as that seems as I write it. It is only to you, who
have taught me so much, that I could write it. I have tried to know him and to realize that
I am his daughter, but we are the coldest acquaintances, that is all; and I cannot see how
a change could come. I do not understand him; least of all do I understand why he is a gambler.
It has been explained to me that it is his great passion, but all I comprehend in these words
is that they are full of shame for his daughter.

"This is what was told me: he has always played heavily and skillfully--adding much to his
estate in that way--and in Rouen always with a certain coterie, which was joined, several years
ago, by the man you came to save last night.

"Your devotion to Mr. Gray has been the most beautiful thing in your life. I know all that
the town knows of that, except the thousand hidden sacrifices you have made for him, those
things which no one will ever know. (And yet, you see, I know them after all!) For your sake,
because you love him, I will not even call him unworthy.

"I have heard--from one who told unwillingly--the story of the night two years ago, when the
play ran so terribly high; and how, in the morning when they went away, all were poorer except
one, their host!--how Mr. Gray had nothing left in the world, and owed my father a great sum
which was to be paid in twenty-four hours; how you took everything you had saved in the years
of hard work at your profession, and borrowed the rest on your word, and brought it to my father
that afternoon; how, when you had paid your friend's debt, you asked my father not to play
with Mr. Gray again; and my father made that his excuse to send you a challenge. You laughed
at the challenge--and you could afford to laugh at it.

"But this is all shame, shame for Robert Carewe's daughter. It seems to me that I should hide
and not lift my head; that I, being of my father's blood, could never look you in the face
again. It is so unspeakably painful and ugly. I think of my father's stiff pride and his look
of the eagle,--and he still plays with your friend, almost always 'successfully!' And your
friend still comes to play!--but I will not speak of that side of it.

"Mr. Gray has made you poor, but I know it was not that which made you come seeking him last
night, when I found you there in the hail. It was for his sake you came--and you went away
for mine. Now that I know, at last--now that I have heard what your life has been (and oh I
heard so much more than I have written!)--now that my eyes have been opened to see you as you
are, I am proud, and glad and humble that I can believe that you felt a friendship for me strong
enough to have made you go 'for my sake.' You will write to me just once, won't you? and tell
me if there was any error in what I listened to; but you must not come to the garden. Now that
I know you, I cannot meet you clandestinely again. It would hurt the dignity which I feel in
you now, and my own poor dignity--such as it is! I have been earnestly warned of the danger
to you. Besides, you must let me test myself. I am all fluttering and frightened and excited.
You will obey me, won't you?--do not come until I send for you. Elizabeth Carewe."

Mr. Gray, occupied with his toilet about noon, heard his partner descending to the office with
a heavy step, and issued from his room to call a hearty greeting. Tom looked back over his
shoulder and replied cheerily, though with a certain embarrassment; but Crailey, catching sight
of his face, uttered a sharp ejaculation and came down to him.

"Why, what's the matter, Tom? You're not going to be sick? You look like the devil and all!"

"I'm all right, never fear!" Tom laughed, evading the other's eye. "I'm going out in the country
on some business, and I dare say I shall not be back for a couple of days; it will be all up
and down the county." He set down a travelling-bag he was carrying, and offered the other his
hand. "Good-by."

"Can't I go for you? You don't look able."

"No, no. It's something I'll have to attend to myself."

"Ah, I suppose," said Crailey, gently, "I suppose it's important, and you couldn't trust me
to handle it. Well--God knows you're right! I've shown you often enough how incompetent I am
to do anything but write jingles!"

"You do some more of them--without the whiskey, Crailey. They're worth more than all the lawing
Gray and Vanrevel have ever done or ever will do. Good-by---and be kind to yourself."

He descended to the first landing, and then, "Oh, Crailey," he called, with the air of having
forgotten something he had meant to say.

"Yes, Tom?"

"This morning at the post-office I found a letter addressed to me. I opened it and--" He hesitated,
and uneasily shifted his weight from one foot to the other, with a feeble, deprecatory laugh.

"Yes, what of it?"

"Well--there seemed to be a mistake. I think it must have been meant for you. Somehow, she--she's
picked up a good many wrong impressions, and, Lord knows how, but she's mixed our names up
and--and I've left the letter for you. It's on my table."

He turned and calling a final good-by over his shoulder, went clattering noisily down to the
street and vanished from Crailey's sight.

Noon found Tom far out on the National Road, creaking along over the yellow dust in a light
wagon, between bordering forests that smelt spicily of wet underbrush and May-apples; and,
here and there, when they would emerge from the woods to cleared fields, liberally outlined
by long snake-fences of black walnut, the steady, jog-trotting old horse lifted his head and
looked interested in the world, but Tom never did either. Habitually upright, walking or sitting,
straight, keen, and alert, that day's sun saw him drearily hunched over, mile after mile, his
forehead laced with lines of pain. He stopped at every farm-house and cabin, and, where the
young men worked in the fields, hailed them from the road, or hitched his horse to the fence
and crossed the soft furrows to talk with them. At such times he stood erect again, and spoke
stirringly, finding eager listeners. There was one question they asked him over and over:

"But are you sure the call will come?"

"As sure as that we stand here; and it will come before the week is out. We must be ready!"

Often, when he left them, they would turn from the work in hand, leaving it as it was, to lie
unfinished in the fields, and make their way slowly and thoughtfully to their homes, while
Tom climbed into his creaking little wagon once more, only to fall into the same dull, hunched-over
attitude. He had many things to think out before he faced Rouen and Crailey Gray again, and
more to fight through to the end with himself. Three days he took for it, three days driving
through the soft May weather behind the kind, old jog-trotting horse; three days on the road,
from farm-house to farm-house and from field to field, from cabin of the woods to cabin in
the clearing. Tossing unhappily at night, he lay sleepless till dawn, though not because of
the hard beds; and when daylight came, journeyed steadily on again, over the vagabond little
hills that had gypsied it so far into the prairie-land in their wanderings from their range
on the Ohio, and, passing the hills, went on through the flat forest-land, always hunched over
dismally in the creaking wagon.

But on the evening of the third day he drove into town, with the stoop out of his shoulders
and the lustre back in his eyes. He was haggard, gray, dusty, but he had solved his puzzle,
and one thing was clear in his mind as the thing that he would do. He patted the old horse
a hearty farewell as he left him with the liveryman from whom he had hired him, and strode
up Main Street with the air of a man who is going somewhere. It was late, but there were more
lights than usual in the windows and more people on the streets. Boys ran shouting, while,
here and there, knots of men argued loudly, and in front of the little corner drug-store a
noisily talkative, widely gesticulative crowd of fifty or more had gathered. An old man, a
cobbler, who had left a leg at Tippecanoe and replaced it with a wooden one, chastely decorated
with designs of his own carving, came stumping excitedly down the middle of the street, where
he walked for fear of the cracks in the wooden pavement, which were dangerous to his art-leg
when he came from the Rouen House bar, as on the present occasion. He hailed Tom by name.

"You're the lad, Tom Vanrevel," he shouted. "You're the man to lead the boys out for the glory
of the State! You git the whole blame Fire De-partment out and enlist 'em before morning! Take
'em down to the Rio Grande, you hear me?

"And you needn't be afraid of their puttin' it out, if it ketches afire, neither!"

Tom waved his hand and passed on; but at the open doors of the Catholic Church he stopped and
looked up and down the street, and then, unnoticed, entered to the dim interior, where the
few candles showed only a bent old woman in black kneeling at the altar. Tom knew where Elizabeth
Carewe knelt each morning; he stepped softly through the shadowy silence to her place, knelt,
and rested his head upon the rail of the bench before him.

The figure at the altar raised itself after a time, and the old woman limped slowly up a side
aisle, mumbling her formulas, courtesying to the painted saints, on her way out. The very thinnest
lingerings of incense hung on the air, seeming to Tom like the faint odor that might exhale
from a heavy wreath of marguerites, worn in dark-brown hair. Yet, the place held nothing but
peace and good-will. And he found nothing else in his own heart. The street was quiet when
he emerged from that lorn vigil; the corner groups had dissolved; shouting youths no longer
patrolled the sidewalks. Only one quarter showed signs of life: the little clubhouse, where
the windows still shown brightly, and whence came the sound of many voices settling the destinies
of the United States of America. Thither Tom bent his steps, thoughtfully, and with a quiet
mind. There was a small veranda at the side of the house; here he stood unobserved to look
in upon his noisy and agitated friends.

They were all there, from the old General and Mr. Bareaud, to the latter's son, Jefferson,
and young Frank Chenoweth. They were gathered about a big table upon which stood a punch-bowl
and Trumble, his brow as angry red as the liquor in the cup he held, was proposing a health
to the President in a voice of fury.

"In spite of all the Crailey Grays and traitors this side of hell!" he finished politely.

Crailey emerged instantaneously from the general throng and mounted a chair, tossing his light
hair back from his forehead, his eyes sparkling and happy. "You find your own friends already
occupying the place you mentioned, do you, General?" he asked.

General Trumble stamped and shook his fist.

"You're a spawn of Aaron Burr!" he vociferated. "There's not a man here to stand by your infernal
doctrines. You sneer at your own State, you sneer at your own country, you defile the sacred
ground! What are you, by the Almighty, who attack your native land in this, her hour of peril!"

"Peril to my native land!" laughed Crailey. "From Santa Anna?"

"The General's right, sir," exclaimed the elder Chenoweth indignantly, and most of the listeners
appeared to agree with him. "It's a poor time to abuse the President when he's called for volunteers
and our country is in danger, sir!"

"Who is in danger?" answered Crailey, lifting his hand to still the clamor of approbation that
arose. "Is Polk in danger? Or Congress? But that would be too much to hope! Do you expect to
see the Greasers in Washington? No, you idiots, you don't! Yet there'll be plenty of men to
suffer and die; and the first should be those who thrust this war on us and poor little Mexico;
but it won't be they; the men who'll do the fighting and dying will be the country boys and
the like of us from the towns, while Mr. Polk sits planning at the White House how he can get
elected again. I wish Tom were here, confound you! You listen to him because he always has
the facts and I'm just an embroiderer, you think. What's become of the gaudy campaign cry you
were all wearing your lungs out with a few months ago? 'Fifty-four-forty or fight!' Bah! Polk
twisted the lion's tail with that until after election. Then he saw he had to make you forget
it, or fight England and be ruined, so he forces war on Mexico, and the country does forget
it. That's it: he asks three regiments of volunteers from this State to die of fevers and get
shot, so that he can steal another country and make his own elect him again. And you ask me
to drink the health of the politician who sits at home and sends his fellowmen to die to fix
his rotten jobs for him?" Crailey had persuaded himself into such earnestness, that the depth
of his own feeling almost choked him, but he finished roundly in his beautiful, strong voice:
"I'll drink for the good punch's sake--but that health?--I'll see General Trumble in heaven
before I'll drink it!"

There rose at once a roar of anger and disapproval, and Crailey became a mere storm centre
amid the upraised hands gestulating madly at him as he stood, smiling again, upon his chair.

"This comes of living with Tom Vanrevel!" shouted the General furiously. "This is his damned
Abolition teaching! You're only his echo; you spend half your life playing at being Vanrevel!"

"Where is Vanrevel?" said Tappingham Marsh.

"Ay, where is he!" raged Trumble, hammering the table till the glasses rang. "Let him come
and answer for his own teaching; it's wasted time to talk to this one; he's only the pupil.
Where is the traitor?"

"Here," answered a voice from the doorway; and though the word was spoken quietly it was nevertheless,
at that juncture, silencing. Everyone turned toward the door as Vanrevel entered. But the apoplectic
General, whom Crailey's speech had stirred to a fury beyond control, almost leaped at Tom's throat.

"Here's the tea-sipping old Granny," he bellowed hoarsely. (He was ordinarily very fond of
Tom.) "Here's the master! Here's the man whose example teaches Crailey Gray to throw mud at
the flag. He'll stay here at home with Crailey, of course, and throw more, while the others
boys march out to die under it."

"On the contrary," answered Tom, raising his voice, "I think you'll find Crailey Gray the first
to enlist, and as for myself, I've raised sixty men in the country, and I want forty more from
Rouen, in order to offer the Governor a full company. So it's come to 'the King, not the man';
Polk is a pitiful trickster, but the country needs her sons; that's enough for us to know;
and while I won't drink to James Polk "--he plunged a cup in the bowl and drew it out brimming--"I'll
empty this to the President!"

It was then that from fifty throats the long, wild shout went up that stirred Rouen, and woke
the people from their midnight beds for half a mile around.

CHAPTER XIV. The Firm of Gray and Vanrevel

For the first time it was Crailey who sat waiting for Tom to come home. In a chair drawn to
his partner's desk in the dusty office, he half-reclined, arms on the desk, his chin on his
clenched fists. To redeem the gloom he had lit a single candle, which painted him dimly against
the complete darkness of his own shadow, like a very old portrait whose background time has
solidified into shapeless browns; the portrait of a fair-haired gentleman, the cavalier, or
the Marquis, one might have said at first glance; not describing it immediately as that of
a poet, for there was no mark of art upon Crailey, not even in his hair, for they all wore
it rather long then. Yet there was a mark upon him, never more vivid than as he sat waiting
in the loneliness of that night for Tom Vanrevel; though what the mark was and what its significance
might have been puzzling to define. Perhaps, after all, Fanchon Bareaud had described it best
when she told Crailey one day, with a sudden hint of apprehensive tears, that he had a "look
of fate."

Tom took his own time in coming; he had stayed at the club to go over his lists--so he had
told Crailey--with the General and old Bareaud. His company was almost complete, and Crailey
had been the first to volunteer, to the dumfounding of Trumble, who had proceeded to drink
his health again and again. But the lists could not detain Tom two hours, Crailey knew, and
it was two hours since the new volunteers had sung "The Star Spangled Banner" over the last
of the punch, and had left the club to Tom and the two old men. Only once or twice in that
time had Crailey shifted his position, or altered the direction of his set gaze at nothing.
But at last he rose, went to the window and, leaning far out, looked down the street toward
the little clubhouse. Its lights were extinguished and all was dark up and down the street.
Abruptly Crailey went back to the desk and blew out the candle, after which he sat down again
in the same position. Twenty minutes later he heard Tom's step on the stair, coming up very
softly. Crailey waited in silence until his partner reached the landing, then relit the candle.

"Tom," he called. "Come in, please, I've been waiting for you."

There was a pause before Tom answered from the hall:

"I'm very tired, Crailey. I think I'll go up to bed."

"No," said Crailey, "come in."

The door was already open, but Tom turned toward it reluctantly. He stopped at the threshold
and the two looked at each other.

"I thought you wouldn't come as long as you believed I was up," said Crailey, "so I blew out
the light. I'm sorry I kept you outside so long."

"Crailey, I'm going away to-morrow," the other began. "I am to go over and see the Governor
and offer him this company, and to-night I need sleep, so please--"

"No," interrupted Crailey quietly, "I want to know what you're going to do."

"To do about what?"

"About me."

"Oh!" Tom's eyes fell at once from his friend's face and rested upon the floor. Slowly he walked
to the desk and stood in embarrassed contemplation of the littered books and papers, while
the other waited.

"I think it's best for you to tell me," said Crailey.

"You think so?" Tom's embarrassment increased visibly, and there was mingled with it an odd
appearance of apprehension, probably to relieve which he very deliberately took two long cheroots
from his pocket, laid one on the desk for Crailey and lit the other himself, with extreme carefulness,
at the candle. After this ceremonial he dragged a chair to the window, tilted back in it with
his feet on the low sill, his back to the thin light and his friend, and said in a slow, gentle
tone: "Well, Crailey?"

"I suppose you mean that I ought to offer my explanation first," said the other, still standing.
"Well, there isn't any." He did not speak doggedly or sullenly, as one in fault, but more with
the air of a man curiously ready to throw all possible light upon a cloudy phenomenon. "It's
very simple--all that I know about it. I went there first on the evening of the Madrillon masquerade
and played a little comedy for her, so that some of my theatrical allusions--they weren't very
illuminating!--to my engagement to Fanchon, made her believe I was Vanrevel when her father
told her about the pair of us. I discovered that the night his warehouses burned--and I saw
something more, because I can't help seeing such things: that yours was just the character
to appeal to a young girl fresh from the convent and full of honesty and fine dreams and fire.
Nobody could arrange a more fatal fascination for a girl of nineteen than to have a deadly
quarrel with her father. And that's especially true when the father's like that mad brute of
a Bob Carewe! Then, too, you're more or less the town model of virtue and popular hero, in
spite of the Abolitionism, just as I am the town scamp. So I let it go on, and played a little
at being you, saying the things that you only think--that was all. It isn't strange that it's
lasted until now, not more than three weeks, after all. She's only seen you four or five times,
and me not much oftener. No one speaks of you to her, and I've kept out of sight when others
were about. Mrs. Tanberry is her only close friend, and, naturally, wouldn't be apt to mention
that you are dark and I am fair, or to describe us personally, any more than you and I would
mention the general appearance of people we both meet about town. But you needn't tell me that
it can't last much longer. Some petty, unexpected trifle will turn up, of course. All that
I want to know is what you mean to do."

"To do?" repeated Tom softly, and blew a long scarf of smoke out of the window.

"Ah!" Crailey's voice grew sharp and loud. "There are many things you needn't tell me! You
need not tell me what I've done to you--nor what you think of me! You need not tell me that
you have others to consider, that you have Miss Carewe to think of. Don't you suppose I know
that? And you need not tell me that you have a duty to Fanchon--"

"Yes," Tom broke in, his tone not quite steady. "Yes, I've thought of that."

"Well?"

"Have you--did you--" he hesitated, but Crailey understood immediately.

"No; I haven't seen her again."

"But you--"

"Yes--I wrote. I answered the letter."

"As-"

"Yes; I signed your name. I told you that I had just let things go on," Crailey answered, with
an impatient movement of his hands. "What are you going to do?"

"I'm going over to see the Governor in the morning. I'll be away two or three days, I imagine."

"Vanrevel!" exclaimed Crailey hotly, "Will you give me an answer and not beat about the bush
any longer? Or do you mean that you refuse to answer?"

Tom dropped his cigar upon the brick window-ledge with an abysmal sigh. "Oh, no, it isn't that,"
he answered mildly "I've been thinking it all over for three days in the country, and when
I got back tonight I found that I had come to a decision without knowing it, and that I had
come to it even before I started; my leaving the letter for you proved it. It's a little like
this Mexican war, a mixed-up problem and only one thing clear. A few schemers have led the
country into it to increase the slave-power and make us forget that we threatened England when
we couldn't carry out the threat. And yet, if you look at it broadly, these are the smaller
things and they do not last. The means by which the country grows may be wrong, but its growth
is right; it is only destiny, working out through lies and blood, but the end will be good.
It is bound to happen and you can't stop it. I believe the men who make this war for their
own uses will suffer in hell-fire for it; but it is made, and there's only one thing I can
see as the thing for me to do. They've called me every name on earth--and the same with you,
too, Crailey--because I'm an Abolitionist, but now, whether the country has sinned or not,
a good many thousand men have got to do the bleeding for her, and I want to be one of them.
That's the one thing that is plain to me."

"Yes," returned Crailey. "You know I'm with you; and I think you're always right. Yes; we'll
all be on the way in a fortnight or so. Do you mean you won't quarrel with me because of that?
Do you mean it would be a poor time now, when we're all going out to take our chances together?"

"Quarrel with you!" Tom rose and came to the desk, looking across it at his friend. "Did you
think I might do that?"

"Yes--I thought so."

"Crailey!" And now Tom's expression showed desperation; it was that of a man whose apprehensions
have culminated and who is forced to face a crisis long expected, long averted, but imminent
at last. His eyes fell from Crailey's clear gaze and his hand fidgeted among the papers on
the desk.

"No," he began with a painful lameness and hesitation. "I did not mean it--no; I meant, that,
in the same way, only one thing in this other--this other affair that seems so confused and
is such a problem--only one thing has grown clear. It doesn't seem to me that--that--" here
he drew a deep breath, before he went on with increasing nervousness--"that if you like a man
and have lived with him a good many years; that is to say, if you're really much of a friend
to him, I don't believe you sit on a high seat and judge him. Judging, and all that, haven't
much part in it. And it seems to me that you've got yourself into a pretty bad mix-up, Crailey."

"Yes," said Crailey. "It's pretty bad."

"Well," Tom looked up now, with an almost tremulous smile, "I believe that is about all I can
make of it. Do you think it's the part of your best friend to expose you? It seems to me that
if there ever was a time when I ought to stand by you, it's now."

There was a silence while they looked at each other across the desk in the faint light. Tom's
eye fell again as Crailey opened his lips.

"And in spite of everything," Crailey said breathlessly, "you mean that you won't tell?"

"How could I, Crailey?" said Tom Vanrevel as he turned away.

CHAPTER XV. When June Came

"Methought I met a Damsel Fair And tears were in her eyes; Her head and arms were bare, I heard
her bursting sighs.

"I stopp'd and looked her in the face, 'Twas then she sweetly smiled. Her features shone with
mournful grace, Far more than Nature's child.

"With diffident and downcast eye, In modest tones she spoke; She wiped a tear and gave a sigh,
And then her silence broke--"

So sang Mrs. Tanberry at the piano, relieving the melancholy which possessed her; but Nelson,
pausing in the hail to listen, and exceedingly curious concerning the promised utterance of
the Damsel Fair, was to suffer disappointment, as the ballad was broken off abruptly and the
songstress closed the piano with a monstrous clatter. Little doubt may be entertained that
the noise was designed to disturb Mr. Carewe, who sat upon the veranda consulting a brown Principe,
and less that the intended insult was accomplished. For an expression of a vindictive nature
was precipitated in that quarter so simultaneously that the bang of the piano-lid and the curse
were even as the report of a musket and the immediate cry of the wounded.

Mrs. Tanberry at once debouched upon the piazza, showing a vast, clouded countenance. "And
I hope to heaven you already had a headache!" she exclaimed.

"The courtesy of your wish, madam," Carewe replied, with an angry flash of his eye, "is only
equaled by the kindness of heaven in answering it. I have, in fact, a headache. I always have,
nowadays."

"That's good news," returned the lady heartily.

"I thank you," retorted her host.

"Perhaps if you treated your daughter even a decent Indian's kind of politeness, you'd enjoy
better health."

"Ah! And in what failure to perform my duty toward her have I incurred your displeasure?"

"Where is she now?" exclaimed the other excitably. "Where is she now?"

"I cannot say."

"Yes, you can, Robert Carewe!" Mrs. Tanberry retorted, with a wrathful gesture. "You know well
enough she's in her own room, and so do I--for I tried to get in to comfort her when I heard
her crying. She's in there with the door bolted, where you drove her!"

"I drove her!" he sneered.

"Yes, you did, and I heard you. Do you think I couldn't hear you raging and storming at her
like a crazy man? When you get in a temper do you dream there's a soul in the neighborhood
who doesn't know it? You're a fool if you do, because they could have heard you swearing down
on Main Street, if they'd listened. What are you trying to do to her?--break her spirit?--or
what? Because you'll do it, or kill her. I never heard anybody cry so heart-brokenly." Here
the good woman's own eyes filled. "What's the use of pretending?" she went on sorrowfully.
"You haven't spoken to her kindly since you came home. Do you suppose I'm blind to that? You
weren't a bad husband to the poor child's mother; why can't you be a good father to her?"

"Perhaps you might begin by asking her to be a good daughter to me."

"What has she done?"

"The night before I went away she ran to a fire and behaved there like a common street hoyden.
The ladies of the Carewe family have not formerly acquired a notoriety of that kind."

"Bah!" said Mrs. Tanberry.

"The next morning, when I taxed her with it, she dutifully defied and insulted me."

"I can imagine the delicacy with which you 'taxed' her. What has that to do with your devilish
tantrums of this afternoon, Robert Carewe?"

"I am obliged to you for the expression," he returned. "When I came home, this afternoon, I
found her reading that thing." He pointed to many very small fragments of Mr. Cummings's newspaper,
which were scattered about the lawn near the veranda. "She was out here, reading an article
which I had read downtown and which appeared in a special edition of that rotten sheet, sent
out two hours ago."

"Well?"

"Do you know what that article was, madam, do you know what it was?" Although breathing heavily,
Mr. Carewe had compelled himself to a certain outward calmness, but now, in the uncontrollable
agitation of his anger, he sprang to his feet and struck one of the wooden pillars of the porch
a shocking blow with the bare knuckles of his clenched hand. "Do you know what it was? It was
a eulogy of that damned Vanrevel! It pretended to be an account of the enrollment of his infernal
company, but it was nothing more than a glorification of that nigger-loving hound! His company--a
lot of sneaks, who'll run like sheep from the first Greaser--elected him captain yesterday,
and today he received an appointment as major! It dries the blood in my veins to think of it!--that
black dog a major! Good God! am I never to hear the last of him? Cummings wrote it, the fool,
the lying, fawning, slobbering fool; he ought to be shot for it! Neither he nor his paper ever
enter my doors again! And I took the dirty sheet from her hands and tore it to pieces--"

"Yes," interposed Mrs. Tanberry, "it looks as if you had done it with your teeth."

"--And stamped it into the ground!"

"Oh, I heard you!" she said.

Carewe came close to her, and gave her a long look from such bitter eyes that her own fell
before them. "If you've been treacherous to me, Jane Tanberry," he said, "then God punish you!
If they've met--my daughter and that man--while I was away, it is on your head. I don't ask
you, because I believe if you knew anything you'd lie for her sake. But I tell you that as
she read that paper, she did not hear my step on the walk nor know that I was there until I
leaned over her shoulder. And I swear that I suspect her."

He turned and walked to the door, while the indomitable Mrs. Tanberry, silenced for once, sank
into the chair he had vacated. Before he disappeared within the house, he paused.

"If Mr. Vanrevel has met my daughter," he said, in a thick voice, stretching out both hands
in a strange, menacing gesture toward the town that lay darkling in the growing dusk, "if he
has addressed one word to her, or so much as allowed his eyes to rest on her overlong, let
him take care of himself!"

"Oh, Robert, Robert," Mrs. Tanberry cried, in a frightened whisper to herself, "all the fun
and brightness went out of the world when you came home!"

For, in truth, the gayety and light-heartedness which, during the great lady's too brief reign,
had seemed a vital adjunct of the house to make the place resound with music and laughter,
were now departed. No more did Mrs. Tanberry extemporize Dan Tuckers, mazourkas, or quadrilles
in the ball-room, nor Blind-Man's Buff in the library; no more did serenaders nightly seek
the garden with instrumental plunkings and vocal gifts of harmony. I had you fell to have lifted

 He flicked the paper lightly from
him, and it sped across the room like a big bird in awkward flight. For he knew how to preserve
his last day as he wished, and to make all smooth.

He finished his toilet with particular care, took a flower from a vase on his table, placed
it in his coat, and went down to the dusty street, where everything was warm and bright with
summer. It was joy to be alive; there was wine enough in the air; and Crailey made up his mind
not to take a drink that day--the last day! The last day! The three words kept ringing through
his head like a minor phrase from a song. Tomorrow, at noon, they would be churning down the
river; and this was the last day--the last day!

"Still not too late to make another friend at home," he said, stopping to pat the head of a
mangy street cur that came crouching and wobbling toward him like a staveless little keg worried
by scurries of wind. Dogs and children always fell in love with Crailey at first sight, and
he never failed to receive them in the spirit of their approach. Now the mongrel, at his touch,
immediately turned himself over and lay upon the pavement with all paws in air, to say: "Great
lord, magnificent in the graciousness which deigns to cast a glimpse upon this abject cluster
of ribs, I perceive that your heart is too gentle to kick me in my present helplessness; yet
do with me as you will."

"I doubt if you've breakfasted, brother," Crailey responded aloud, rubbing the dog's head softly
with the tip of his boot. "Will you share the meagre fare of one who is a poet, should be a
lawyer, but is about to become a soldier? Eh, but a corporal! Rise, my friend. Up! and be in
your own small self a whole Corporal's Guard! And if your Corporal doesn't come home from the
wars, perhaps you'll remember him kindly? Think?"

He made a vivacious gesture, the small animal sprang into the air, convoluted with gratitude
and new love, while Crailey, laughing softly, led the way to the hotel. There, while he ate
sparsely himself, he provided munificently for his new acquaintance, and recommended him, with
an accompaniment of silver, to the good offices of the Rouen House kitchen. After that, out
into the sunshine again he went, with elastic step, and a merry word and a laugh for everyone
he met. At the old English gardener's he bought four or five bouquets, and carried them on
a round of visits of farewell to as many old ladies who had been kind to him. This done, leaving
his laughter and his flowers behind him, he went to Fanchon and spent part of the afternoon
bringing forth cunning arguments cheerily, to prove to her that General Taylor would be in
the Mexican capital before the volunteers reached New Orleans, and urging upon her his belief
that they would all be back in Rouen before the summer was gone.

But Fanchon could only sob and whisper, "Hush, hush!" in the dim room where they sat, the windows
darkened so that, after he had gone, he should not remember how red her eyes were, and the
purple depths under them, and thus forget how pretty she had been at her best. After a time,
finding that the more he tried to cheer her, the more brokenly she wept, he grew silent, only
stroking her head, while the summer sounds came in through the window: the mill-whir of locusts,
the small monotone of distant farm-bells, the laughter of children in the street, and the gay
arias of a mocking-bird singing in the open window of the next house. So they sat together
through the long, still afternoon of the last day.

No one in Rouen found that afternoon particularly enlivening. Even Mrs. Tanberry gave way to
the common depression, and, once more, her doctrine of cheerfulness relegated to the ghostly
ranks of the purely theoretical, she bowed under the burden of her woe so far as to sing "Methought
I Met a Damsel Fair" (her of the bursting sighs) at the piano. Whenever sadness lay upon her
soul she had acquired the habit of resorting to this unhappy ballad; today she sang it four
times. Mr. Carewe was not at home, and had announced that though he intended to honor the evening
meal by his attendance, he should be away for the evening itself; as comment upon which statement
Mrs. Tanberry had offered ambiguously the one word, "Amen!" He was stung to no reply, and she
had noted the circumstance as unusual, and also that he had appeared to labor with the suppression
of a keen excitement, which made him anxious to escape from her sharp little eyes; an agitation
for which she easily accounted when she recalled that he had seen Vanrevel on the previous
evening. Mr. Carewe had kept his promise to preserve the peace, as he always kept it when the
two met on neutral ground, but she had observed that his face showed a kind of hard-leashed
violence whenever he had been forced to breathe the air of the same room with his enemy, and
that the thing grew on him.

Miss Betty exhibited not precisely a burning interest in the adventure of the Damsel Fair,
wandering out of the room during the second rendition, wandering back again, and once more
away. She had moved about the house in this fashion since early morning, wearing what Mamie
described as a "peak-ed look." White-faced and restless, with distressed eyes, to which no
sleep had come in the night, she could not read; she could no more than touch her harp; she
could not sleep; she could not remain quiet for three minutes together. Often she sank into
a chair with an air of languor and weariness, only to start immediately out of it and seek
some other part of the house, or to go and pace the garden. Here, in the air heavy with roses
and tremulous with June, as she walked rapidly up and down, late in the afternoon, at the time
when the faraway farm-bells were calling men from the fields to supper, the climax of her restlessness
came. That anguish and desperation, so old in her sex, the rebellion against the law that inaction
must be her part, had fallen upon her for the first time. She came to an abrupt stop and struck
her hands together despairingly, and spoke aloud.

"What shall I do! What shall I do!"

"Ma'am?" asked a surprised voice, just behind her.

She wheeled quickly about, to behold a shock-headed urchin of ten in the path near the little
clearing. He was ragged, tanned, dusty, neither shoes nor coat trammelling his independence;
and he had evidently entered the garden through the gap in the hedge.

"I thought you spoke to me?" he said, inquiringly.

"I didn't see you," she returned. "What is it?"

"You Miss Carewe?" he asked; but before she could answer he said, reassuringly, "Why, of course
you are! I remember you perfect, now I git the light on you, so to speak. Don't you remember me?"

"No, I don't think I do."

"Lord!" he responded, wonderingly. "I was one of the boys with you on them boxes the night
of your pa's fire!" Mingled with the surprise in his tone was a respectful unction which intimated
how greatly he honored her father for having been the owner of so satisfactory a conflagration.

"Were you? Perhaps I'll remember you if you give me time."

But at this point the youth recalled the fact that he had an errand to discharge, and, assuming
an expression of businesslike haste too pressing to permit farther parley, sought in his pocket
and produced a sealed envelope, with which he advanced upon her.

"Here. There's an answer. He told me not to tell nobody who sent it, and not to give it to
nobody on earth but you, and how to slip in through the hedge and try and find you in the garden
when nobody was lookin', and he give a pencil for you to answer on the back of it, and a dollar."

Miss Betty took the note, glancing once over her shoulder at the house, but Mrs. Tanberry was
still occupied with the Maiden, and no one was in sight. She read the message hastily.

"I have obeyed you, and shall always. You have not sent for me. Perhaps that was because there
was no time when you thought it safe. Perhaps you have still felt there would be a loss of
dignity. Does that weigh with you against good-by? Tell me, if you can, that you have it in
your heart to let me go without seeing you once more, without good-by--for the last time. Or
was it untrue that you wrote me what you did? Was that dear letter but a little fairy dream
of mine? Ah, will you see me again, this once--this once--let me look at you, let me talk with
you, hear your voice? The last time!"

There was no signature.

Miss Betty quickly wrote four lines upon the same sheet: "Yes--yes! I must see you, must talk
with you before you go. Come at dusk. The garden--near the gap in the hedge. It will be safe
for a little while. He will not be here." She replaced the paper in its envelope, drew a line
through her own name on the letter, and wrote "Mr. Vanrevel" underneath.

"Do you know the gentleman who sent you?" she asked.

"No'm; but he'll be waitin' at his office, 'Gray and Vanrevel,' on Main Street, for the answer."

"Then hurry!" said Betty.

He needed no second bidding, but, with wings on his bare heels, made off through the gap in
the hedge. At the corner of the street he encountered an adventure, a gentleman's legs and
a heavy hand at the same time. The hand fell on his shoulder, arresting his scamper with a
vicious jerk; and the boy was too awed to attempt an escape, for he knew his captor well by
sight, although never before had he found himself so directly in the company of Rouen's richest
citizen. The note dropped from the small trembling fingers, yet those fingers did not shake
as did the man's when, like a flash, Carewe seized upon the missive with his disengaged hand
and saw what two names were on the envelope.

"You were stealing, were you!" he cried, savagely. "I saw you sneak through my hedge!"

"I didn't, either!"

Mr. Carewe ground his teeth, "What were you doing there?"

"Nothing!"

"Nothing!" mocked Carewe. "Nothing! You didn't carry this to the young lady in there and get
her answer?"

"No, sir!" answered the captive, earnestly.

"Cross my heart I didn't. I found it!"

Slowly the corrugations of anger were levelled from the magnate's face, the white heat cooled,
and the prisoner marvelled to find himself in the presence of an urbane gentleman whose placidity
made the scene of a moment ago appear some trick of distorted vision. And yet, curious to behold,
Mr. Carewe's fingers shook even more violently than before, as he released the boy's shoulder
and gave him a friendly tap on the head, at the same time smiling benevolently.

"There, there," he said, bestowing a wink upon the youngster. "It's all right; it doesn't matter--only
I think I see the chance of a jest in this. You wait, while I read this little note, this message
that you found!" He ended by winking again with the friendliest drollery.

He turned his back to the boy, and opened the note; continuing to stand in that position while
he read the two messages. It struck the messenger that, after this, there need be no great
shame in his own lack of this much-vaunted art of reading, since it took so famous a man as
Mr. Carewe such length of time to peruse a little note. But perhaps the great gentleman was
ill, for it appeared to the boy that he lurched several times, once so far that he would have
gone over if he had not saved himself by a lucky stagger. And once, except for the fact that
the face that had turned away had worn an expression of such genial humor, the boy would have
believed that from it issued a sound like the gnashing of teeth.

But when it was turned to him again, it bore the same amiable jocosity of mouth and eye, and
nothing seemed to be the matter, except that those fingers still shook so wildly, too wildly,
indeed, to restore the note to its envelope.

"There," said Mr. Carewe, "put it back, laddie, put it back yourself. Take it to the gentleman
who sent you. I see he's even disguised his hand a trifle-ha! ha!--and I suppose he may not
have expected the young lady to write his name quite so boldly on the envelope! What do you
suppose?"

"I d'know," returned the boy. "I reckon I don't hardly understand."

"No, of course not," said Mr. Carewe, laughing rather madly. "Ha, ha, ha! Of course you wouldn't.
And how much did he give you?"

"Yay!" cried the other, joyously. "Didn't he go and hand me a dollar!"

"How much will you take not to tell him that I stopped you and read it; how much not to speak
of me at all?"

"What?"

"It's a foolish kind of joke, nothing more. I'll give you five dollars never to tell anyone
that you saw me today."

"Don't shoot, Colonel," exclaimed the youth, with a riotous fling of bare feet in the air,
"I'll come down!"

"You'll do it?"

"Five!" he shouted, dancing upon the boards. "Five! I'll cross my heart to die I never hear
tell of you, or ever knew they was sich a man in the world!"

Carewe bent over him. "No! Say: 'God strike me dead and condemn me eternally to the everlasting
flames of hell if I ever tell!"

This entailed quick sobriety, though only benevolence was in the face above him. The jig-step
stopped, and the boy pondered, frightened.

"Have I got to say that?"

Mr. Carewe produced a bank-bill about which the boy beheld a halo. Clearly this was his day;
heaven showed its approval of his conduct by an outpouring of imperishable riches. And yet
the oath misliked him; there was a savor of the demoniacal contract; still that was to be borne
and the plunge taken, for there fluttered the huge sum before his dazzled eyes. He took a deep
breath. "'God strike me dead' "--he began, slowly--"' if I ever '--"

"No. 'And condemn me to the everlasting flames of hell '--"

"Have I got to?"

"Yes."--"'And condemn me to--to the everlasting flames of--of hell, if I ever tell!'"

He ran off, pale with the fear that he might grow up, take to drink and some day tell in his
cups, but so resolved not to coquet with temptation that he went round a block to avoid the
door of the Rouen House bar. Nevertheless, the note was in his hand and the fortune in his pocket.

And Mr. Carewe was safe. He knew that the boy would never tell, and he knew another thing,
for he had read the Journal, though it came no more to his house: he knew that Tom Vanrevel
wore his uniform that evening, and that, even in the dusk, the brass buttons on an officer's
breast make a good mark for a gun steadied along the ledge of a window. As he entered the gates
and went toward the house he glanced up at the window which overlooked his garden from the cupola.

CHAPTER XVIII. The Uniform

Crailey was not the only man in Rouen who had been saying to himself all day that each accustomed
thing he did was done for the last time. Many of his comrades went about with "Farewell, old
friend," in their hearts, not only for the people, but for the usual things of life and the
actions of habit, now become unexpectedly dear and sweet to know or to perform. So Tom Vanrevel,
relieved of his hot uniform, loose as to collar, wearing a big dressing-gown, and stretched
in a chair, watched the sunset from the western window of the dusty office, where he had dreamed
through many sun-sets in summers past, and now took his leave of this old habit of his in silence,
with a long cigar, considering the chances largely against his ever seeing the sun go down
behind the long wooden bridge at the foot of Main Street again.

The ruins of the warehouses had been removed, and the river was laid clear to his sight; it
ran between brown banks like a river of rubies, and, at the wharf, the small evening steamboat,
ugly and grim enough to behold from near by, lay pink and lovely in that broad glow, tooting
imminent departure, although an hour might elapse before it would back into the current. The
sun widened, clung briefly to the horizon, and dropped behind the low hills beyond the bottom
lands; the stream grew purple, then took on a lustre of pearl as the stars came out, while
rosy distances changed to misty blue; the chatter of the birds in the Main Street maples became
quieter, and, through lessening little choruses of twittering, fell gradually to silence. And
now the blue dusk crept on the town, and the corner drug-store window-lights threw mottled
colors on the pavement. From the hall, outside the closed office-door, came the sound of quick,
light footsteps; it was Crailey going out; but Tom only sighed to himself, and did not hail
him. So these light footsteps of Crailey Gray echoed but a moment in the stairway and were
heard no more.

A few moments later a tall figure, dressed from neck to heels in a gray cloak crossed the mottled
lights, and disappeared into Carewe Street. This cloaked person wore on his head a soldier's
cap, and Tom, not recognizing him surely, vaguely wondered why Tappingham Marsh chose to muffle
himself so warmly on a evening. He noted the quick, alert tread as like Marsh's usual gait,
but no suspicion crossed his mind that the figure might be that of partner.

A rocket went up from the Rouen House, then another, followed by a salvo of anvils and rackety
discharge of small-arms; the beginning a noble display of fireworks in celebration of prospective
victories of the United States and utter discomfiture of the Mexicans when the Rouen Volunteers
should reach the seat of war, an Exhibition of patriotism which brought little pleasure to
Mr. Vanrevel.

But over the noise of the street he heard his own name shouted from the stairway, and almost
instantly a violent knocking assailed the door. Be-fore he could bid the visitor enter, the
door was flung open by a stout and excited colored woman, who, at sight of him, threw up her
hands in tremulous thanksgiving. It was the vain Mamie.

She sank into a chair, and rocked herself to and fro, gasping to regain her lost breath. "Bless
de good God 'Imighty you am' gone out!" she panted. "I run an' I run, an' I come so fas' I
got stitches in de side f'um head to heel!"

Tom brought her a glass of water, which she drank between gasps.

"I nevah run so befo' enduin' my livin' days," she asserted. "You knows me, who I am an' whum
I cum f'um, nigh's well's I knows who you is, I reckon, Maje' Vanrevel?"

"Yes, yes, I know. Will you tell me who sent you?"

"Miz Tanberry, suh, dat who sended me, an' in a venomous hurry she done de same!"

"Yes. Why? Does she want me?"

Mamie emitted a screech. "'Deed she mos' everlas'in'ly does not! Dat de ve'y exackindes' livin'
t'ing she does not want!"

"Then what is it, Mamie?"

"Lemme git my bref, suh, an' you hole yo'ne whiles I tell you! She say to me, she say: 'Is
you 'quainted Maje' Vanrevel, Mamie?' s' she, an' I up'n' ansuh, 'Not to speak wid, but dey
ain; none on 'em I don' knows by sight, an' none betterer dan him,' I say. Den she say, she
say: 'You run all de way an' fin' dat young man,' she say, s' she, 'an' if you don' git dah
fo' he leave, er don' stop him on de way, den God 'imighty fergive you!' she say. 'But you
tell him f'um Jane Tanberry not to come nigh dis house or dis gyahden dis night! Tell him dat
Jane Tanberry warn him he mus' keep outer Carewe's way ontel he safe on de boat to-morrer.
Tell him Jane Tanberry beg him to stay in he own room dis night, an' dat she beg it on her
bented knees!' An' dis she say to me when I tole her what Nelson see in dat house dis evenin'.
An' hyuh I is, an' hyuh yew is, an' de blessed Jesus be thank', you ir hyuh!"

Tom regarded her with a grave attention. "What made Mrs. Tanberry think I might be coming there
to-night?"

"Dey's cur'ous goin's-on in dat house, suh! Them went one spite serenaders, on forebodings will
be done attractively for; and wage as they have then'bravado, and plan where were he stood away

 It
was Tom who had borne him to that room. "I have carried him before this," he said, waving the
others aside.

Not long after sunrise, when the bed had been moved near the window, Crailey begged Fanchon
to bring him a miniature of his mother which he had given her, and urged her to go for it herself;
he wanted no hands but hers to touch it, he said. And when she had gone he asked to be left
alone with Tom.

"Give me your hand, Tom," he said, faintly. "I'd like to keep hold of it a minute or so. I
couldn't have said that yesterday, could I, without causing us both horrible embarrassment?
But I fancy I can now, because I'm done for. That's too bad, isn't it? I'm very young, after
all. Do you remember what poor Andre Chenier said as he went up to be guillotined?--' There
were things in this head of mine!' But I want to tell you what's been the matter with me. It
was just my being a bad sort of poet. I suppose that I've never loved anyone; yet I've cared
more deeply than other men for every lovely thing I ever saw, and there's so little that hasn't
loveliness in it. I'd be ashamed not to have cared for the beauty in all the women I've made
love to--but about this one--the most beautiful of all--I--------"

"She will understand!" said Tom, quickly.

"She will--yes--she's wise and good. If Fanchon knew, there wouldn't be even a memory left
to her--and I don't think she'd live. And do you know, I believe I've done a favor for Miss
Betty in getting myself shot; Carewe will never come back. Tom, was ever a man's knavery so
exactly the architect of his own destruction as mine? And for what gain? Just the excitement
of the comedy from day to day!--for she was sure to despise me as soon as she knew--and the
desire to hear her voice say another kindly thing to me--and the everlasting perhaps in every
woman, and this one the Heart's Desire of all the world! Ah, well! Tell me--I want to hear
it from you--how many hours does the doctor say?"

"Hours, Crailey?" Tom's hand twitched pitifully in the other's feeble grasp.

"I know it's only a few."

"They're all fools, doctors!" exclaimed Vanrevel, fiercely.

"No, no. And I know that nothing can be done. You all see it, and you want me to go easily--or
you wouldn't let me have my own way so much! It frightens me, I own up, to think that so soon
I'll be wiser than the wisest in the world. Yet I always wanted to know. I've sought and I've
sought--but now to go out alone on the search--it must be the search, for the Holy Grail--I----"

"Please don't talk," begged Tom, in a broken whisper. "For mercy's sake, lad. It wears on you so."

Crailey laughed weakly. "Do you think I could die peacefully without talking a great deal?
There's one thing I want, Tom. I want to see all of them once more, all the old friends that
are going down the river at noon. What harm could it do? I want them to come by here on their
way to the boat, with the band and the new flag. But I want the band to play cheerfully! Ask
'em to play 'Rosin the Bow,' will you? I've never believed in mournfulness, and I don't want
to see any of it now. It's the rankest impiety of all! And besides, I want to see them as they'll
be when they come marching home--they must look gay!"

"Ah, don't, lad, don't!" Tom flung one arm about the other's shoulder and Crailey was silent,
but rested his hand gently on his friend's head. In that attitude Fanchon found them when she came.

The volunteers gathered at the court-house two hours before noon. They met each other dismally,
speaking in undertones as they formed in lines of four, while their dispirited faces showed
that the heart was out of them. Not so with the crowds of country folk and townspeople who
lined the streets to see the last of them. For these, when the band came marching down the
street and took its place, set up a royal cheering that grew louder as Jefferson Bareaud, the
color-bearer, carried the flag to the head of the procession. With the recruits marched the
veterans of 1812 and the Indian wars, the one-legged cobbler stumping along beside General
Trumble, who looked very dejected and old. The lines stood in silence, and responded to the
cheering by quietly removing their hats; so that the people whispered that it was more like
an Odd Fellows' Sunday funeral than the departure of enthusiastic patriots for the seat of
war. General Trumble's was not the only sad face in the ranks; all were downcast and nervous,
even those of the lads from the country, who had not known the comrade they were to leave behind.

Jefferson unfurled the flag; Marsh gave the word of command, the band began to play a quick-step,
and the procession moved forward down the cheering lane of people, who waved little flags and
handkerchiefs and threw their hats in the air as they shouted. But, contrary to expectation,
the parade was not directly along Main Street to the river. "Right wheel! March!" commanded
Tappingham, hoarsely, waving his sword, and Jefferson led the way into Carewe Street.

"For God's sake, don't cry now!" and Tappingham, with a large drop streaking down his own cheek,
turned savagely upon Lieutenant Cummings. "That isn't what he wants. He wants to see us looking
cheery and smiling. We can do it for him this once, I guess! I never saw him any other way."

"You look damn smiling yourself!" snuffled Will.

"I will when we turn in at the gates," retorted his Captain. "On my soul, I swear I'll kill
every sniffling idiot that doesn't!--In line, there!" he stormed ferociously at a big recruit.

The lively strains of the band and the shouting of the people grew louder and louder in the
room where Crailey lay. His eyes glistened as he heard, and he smiled, not the old smile of
the worldly prelate, but merrily, like a child when music is heard. The room was darkened,
save for the light of the one window which fell softly upon his head and breast and upon another
fair head close to his, where Fanchon knelt. In the shadows at one end of the room were Miss
Betty and Mrs. Tanberry and Mrs. Bareaud and the white-haired doctor who had said, "Let him
have his own way in all he asks." Tom stood alone, close by the head of the couch.

"Hail to the band!" Crailey chuckled, softly. "How the rogues keep the time! It's 'Rosin the
Bow,' all right! Ah, that is as it should be. Mrs. Tanberry, you and I have one thing in common,
if you'll let me flatter myself so far: we've always believed in good cheer in spite of the
devil and all, you and I, eh? The best of things, even if things are bad, dear lady, eh?"

"You darling vagabond!" Mrs. Tanberry murmured, trying to smile back to him.

"Hark to 'em!" said Crailey. "They're very near! Only hear the people cheer them! They'll 'march
away so gaily,' won't they?--and how right that is!" The vanguard appeared in the street, and
over the hedge gleamed the oncoming banner, the fresh colors flying out on a strong breeze.
Crailey greeted it with a breathless cry. "There's the flag--look, Fanchon, your flag!--. waving
above the hedge; and it's Jeff who carries it. Doesn't it always make you want to dance! Bravo,
bravo!"

The procession halted for a moment in the street and the music ceased. Then, with a jubilant
flourish of brass and the roll of drums, the band struck up "The Star Spangled Banner," and
Jefferson Bareaud proudly led the way through the gates and down the driveway, the bright silk
streaming overhead. Behind him briskly marched the volunteers, with heads erect and cheerful
faces, as they knew Corporal Gray wished to see them, their Captain flourishing his sword in
the air.

"Here they come! Do you see, Fanchon?" cried Crailey, excitedly. "They are all there, Jeff
and Tappingham, and the two Madrillons and Will, the dear old fellow--he'll never write a decent
paragraph as long as he lives, God bless him!--and young Frank--what deviltries I've led the
boy into!--and there's the old General, forgetting all the tiffs we've had. God bless them
all and grant them all a safe return! What on earth are they taking off their hats for?--Ah,
good-by, boys, good-by!"

They saw the white face at the window, and the slender hand fluttering its farewell, and Tappingham
halted his men.

"Three times three for Corporal Gray!" he shouted, managing, somehow, to keep the smile upon
his lips. "Three times three, and may he rejoin his company before we enter the Mexican capital!"

He beat the time for the thunderous cheers that they gave; the procession described a circle
on the lawn, and then, with the band playing and colors flying, passed out of the gates and
took up the march to the wharf.

"The flag, the flag!" whispered Crailey, following it with his eyes. "It shows that you helped
make it, Fanchon, it's so beautiful. Ah, Tom, they've said we abused it, sometimes--it was
only that we loved it so well we didn't like to see anyone make it look silly or mean. But,
after all, no man can do that--no, nor no group of men, nor party!" His voice grew louder as
the last strains of the music came more faintly from the street. "They'll take your banner
across the Rio Grande, Fanchon, but that is not all--some day its stars must spread over the
world! Don't you all see that they will?"

After a little while, he closed his eyes with a sigh; the doctor bent over him quickly, and
Miss Betty started forward unconsciously and cried out.

But the bright eyes opened again and fixed themselves upon her with all their old, gay inscrutability.

"Not yet," said Crailey. "Miss Carewe, may I tell you that I am sorry I could not have known
you sooner? Perhaps you might have liked me for Fanchon's sake--I know you care for her."

"I do--I do!" she faltered. "I love her, and--ah!--I do like you, Mr. Gray, for I know you,
though I never--met you until--last night. God bless you--God bless you!"

She wavered a moment, like a lily in the wind, and put out a hand blindly. "Not you!" she said
sharply, as Tom Vanrevel started toward her. Mrs. Tanberry came quickly and put an arm about
her, and together they went out of the room.

"You must be good to her, Tom," said Crailey then, in a very low voice.

"I!" answered Tom, gently. "There was never a chance of that, lad."

"Listen," whispered Crailey. "Lean down--no--closer." He cast a quick glance at Fanchon, kneeling
at the other side of the bed, her golden head on the white coverlet, her outstretched hand
clutching his; and he spoke so close to Tom's ear and in so low a tone that only Tom could
hear. "She never cared for me. She felt that she ought to--but that was only because I masqueraded
in your history. She wanted to tell me before I went away that there was no chance for me.
She was telling me that, when he called from the window. It was at the dance, the night before,
that she knew. I think there has been someone else from the first--God send it's you! Did you
speak to her that night or she to you?"

"Ah, no," said Tom Vanrevel. "All the others."

Mrs. Tanberry and Betty and Mr. Bareaud waited in the library, the two women huddled together
on a sofa, with their arms round each other, and all the house was very still. By and by, they
heard a prolonged, far-away cheering and the steamer's whistle, and knew that the boat was
off. Half an hour later, Will Cummings came back alone, entered the room on tip-toe, and silently
sank into a chair near Mr. Bareaud, with his face away from Miss Betty. He was to remain in
Rouen another week, and join his regiment with Tom. None of the three appeared to notice his
coming more than dimly, and he sat with his face bowed in his hands, and did not move.

Thus perhaps an hour passed, with only a sound of footsteps on the gravel of the driveway,
now and then, and a low murmur of voices in the rear of the house where people came to ask
after Crailey; and when the door of the room where he lay was opened, the four watchers started
as at a loud explosion. It was Mrs. Bareaud and the old doctor, and they closed the door again,
softly, and came in to the others. They had left Crailey alone with Fanchon and Tom Vanrevel,
the two who loved him best.

The warm day beyond the windows became like Sunday, no voices sounded from without in the noon
hush, though sometimes a little group of people would gather across the street to eye the house
curiously and nod and whisper. The strong, blue shadows of the veranda pillars stole slowly
across the white floor of the porch in a lessening slant, and finally lay all in a line, as
the tall clock in a corner of the library asthmatically coughed the hour of noon. In this jarring
discordance there was something frightful to Miss Betty. She rose abruptly, and, imperiously
waving back Mrs. Tanberry, who would have detained her--for there was in her face and manner
the incipient wildness of control overstrained to the breaking-point--she went hurriedly out
of the room and out of the house, to the old bench in the garden. There she sank down, her
face hidden in her arms; there on the spot where she had first seen Crailey Gray.

From there, too, had risen the serenade of the man she had spurned and insulted; and there
she had come to worship the stars when Crailey bade her look to them. And now the strange young
teacher was paying the bitter price for his fooleries--and who could doubt that the price was
a bitter one? To have the spirit so suddenly, cruelly riven from the sprightly body that was,
but a few hours ago, hale and alert, obedient to every petty wish, could dance, run, and leap;
to be forced with such hideous precipitation to leave the warm breath of June and undergo the
lonely change, merging with the shadow; to be flung from the exquisite and commonplace day
of sunshine into the appalling adventure that should not have been his for years--and hurled
into it by what hand!--ah, bitter, bitter price for a harlequinade! And, alas, alas! for the
brave harlequin!

A gentle touch fell upon her shoulder, and Miss Betty sprang to her feet and screamed. It was
Nelson who stood before her, hat in hand, his head deeply bowed.

"Is he with you?" she cried, clutching at the bench for support.

"No'm," answered the old man, humbly. "I reckon we all ain' goin' see dat man no mo'."

"Where is he?"

"On de way, honey, on de way."

"The way--to Rouen!" she gasped.

"No'm; he goin' cross de big water." He stretched out his hand and pointed solemnly to the
east. "Him an' me we cotch de boat, an' yo' pa mek 'em taken de hosses on bode. Den we git
off at Leeville, five mile' down de rivuh, an' yo' pa hol' de boat whiles I rid back alone
an' git de news, an' what de tale is you all is tole, f'um ole Mist' Chen'eth; an' Mist' Chen'eth,
he rid back wid me an' see yo' pa at Leeville, an' dey talk in de shed by de landin', an' yo'
pa tell Mist' Chen'eth what 'rangements he goin' make wid de proprety. 'Den he git on de boat
ag'in an' dey sto't her agoin'; an' he ain' wave no good-by, ner say no mo' wu'ds. Mist' Chen'eth
rid back whens de light come; but I res' de hosses an' come back slow, 'case I ponduh on de
worl', an' I mighty sorry fer yo' pa, Missy. He am' comin' back no mo', honey, an' Miz Tanberry
an' me an' Mamie, we goin' take keer er you. Yo' pa gone back dah to de F'enchmun, whuh he
'uz a young man. He mighty sick, an' he scairt, honey; an' he ain' goin' git ovah dat, neider.
'Peah to me, Missy, like he done had a vizhum er he own soul, when he come an' look down at
dat young man layin' on de grass, las' night!"

The old fellow bent his back before her in a solemn bow, as a feudal retainer in allegiance
to the heir, but more in deference to the sorrow written upon her, and respecting its magnitude.
With no words of comfort, for he knew she wanted only to be alone, he moved away, with infirm
steps and shaking head, toward the rear of the house.

Miss Betty threw herself upon the bench again, face downward in her arms. And still the house
lay in silence under the sunshine.

An hour had passed, and the shadows slanted strongly to the east, when the stillness was broken
by a sound, low and small at first, then rising fearfully, a long, quavering wail of supreme
anguish, that clutched and shook the listener's heart. No one could have recognized the voice
as Fanchon's, yet everyone who heard it knew that it was hers; and that the soul of Crailey
Gray had gone out upon the quest for the Holy Grail.

Miss Betty's hands clenched convulsively round the arm of the bench and a fit of shuddering
seized her as if with the grip of a violent chill, though her eyes were dry. Then she lay quiet.

A long time afterward, she became aware of a step that paced the garden path behind her, and
turned her face upon her arm so that she saw, but made no other motion. It was Tom Vanrevel,
walking slowly up and down, his hands behind his back and his hat pulled far down over his
eyes. He had not seen her.

She rose and spoke his name.

He turned and came to her. "Almost at the very last," he said, "Crailey whispered to me that
he knew you thought him a great scamp, but to tell you to be sure to remember that it was all
true about the stars."

CHAPTER XX. "Goodby"

It was between twilight and candlelight, the gentle half-hour when the kind old Sand Man steals
up the stairs of houses where children are; when rustic lovers stroll with slow and quiet steps
down country lanes, and old bachelors are loneliest and dream of the things that might have
been. Through the silence of the clear dusk came the whistle of the evening boat that was to
bear Tom Vanrevel through the first stage of his long journey to the front of war, and the
sound fell cheerlessly upon Miss Betty's ear, as she stood leaning against the sun-dial among
the lilac bushes. Her attitude was not one of reverie; yet she stood very still, so still that,
in the wan shimmer of the faded afterglow, one might have passed close by her and not have
seen her. The long, dark folds of her gown showed faintly against the gray stone, and her arms,
bare from the elbow, lay across the face of the dial with unrelaxed fingers clenching the cornice;
her head drooping, not languidly but with tension, her eyes half-closed, showing the lashes
against a pale cheek; and thus, motionless, leaning on the stone in the dusk, she might have
been Sorrow's self.

She did not move, there was not even a flicker of the eyelashes, when a step sounded on the
gravel of the driveway, and Vanrevel came slowly from the house. He stopped at a little distance
from her, hat in hand. He was very thin, worn and old-looking, and in the failing light might
have been taken for a tall, gentle ghost; yet his shoulders were squared and he held himself
as straight as he had the first time she had ever seen him.

Their feet are only waiting their removal. Very, to churches are

 Now you
come to me to look at the same thing again--and the boat waiting for you! Is it in revenge
for that night at the Bareauds'? Perhaps this sounds wild to you--I can't help that--but why
should you try to make it harder for me?"

From the porch came a strong voice: "Vanrevel!"

"God knows I haven't meant to," said Tom, in bitter pain. "I don't understand. It's Cummings
calling for me; I'll go at once. I'd hoped, stupidly enough, that you would tell me whom it
was you meant when you spoke to Crailey, so that I could help to make it surer that he'd come
back to you. But I've only annoyed you. And you were here--away from the house----avoiding
me, and fearing that I--"

"Vanrevel!" shouted William. (Mrs. Tanberry had not told Lieutenant Cummings where to find
Miss Betty.)

"Fearing? Yes?"

"Fearing that I might discover you." He let his eyes rest on her loveliness once more, and
as he saw that she still trembled, he extended his hand toward her in a gesture of infinite
gentleness, like a blessing, heaved one great sigh, and, with head erect and body straight,
set his face manfully toward the house.

He had taken three strides when his heart stopped beating at an ineffable touch on his sleeve.
For, with a sharp cry, she sprang to him; and then, once more, among the lilac bushes where
he had caught the white kitten, his hand was seized and held between two small palms, and the
eyes of Miss Betty Carewe looked into the very soul of him.

"No!" she cried. "No! Fearing with a sick heart that you might not come!"

Her pale face, misty with sweetness, wavered before him in the dusk, and he lifted his shaking
hand to his forehead; her own went with it, and the touch of that steadied him.

"You mean," he whispered, brokenly, "you mean that you--"

"Yes, always," she answered, rushing through the words, half in tears. "There was a little
time when I loved what your life had been more than you. Ah, it was you that I saw in him.
Yet it was not what you had done after all, but just you! He've forced them to organize down a
trust for a purpose of trust-busting, and in this end they'll wear
you out and have you crush to let the ladder in malevolence of all
you can do.

The retentive, left fighting with men whose voiced desire there was
to be only alone.
 "Crailey, Crailey!"
he murmured.

Her gaze followed his. "Ah, it's he--and they--that make me know you will come back to me!"
she said.
