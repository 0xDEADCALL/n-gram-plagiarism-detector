Mísha was even frightened with joy. He opened his eyes very wide, turned crimson, and suddenly
falling on my shoulder, he began to kiss me and to repeat in a spasmodic voice:--"Uncle ...
benefactor.... May God reward you!..." He melted into tears at last, and doffing his kazák
cap, began to wipe his eyes, his nose, and his lips with it.

"Look out," I said to him. "Remember the condition--not to drink liquor!"

"Why, damn it!" he exclaimed, flourishing both hands, and as a result of that energetic movement
I was still more strongly flooded with that spirituous odour wherewith he was thoroughly impregnated....
"You see, dear uncle, if you only knew my life.... If it were not for grief, cruel Fate, you
know.... But now I swear,--I swear that I will reform, and will prove.... Uncle, I have never
lied--ask any one you like if I have.... I am an honourable, but an unhappy man, uncle; I have
never known kindness from any one...."

At this point he finally dissolved in sobs. I tried to soothe him and succeeded, for when we
drove up to my house Mísha had long been sleeping the sleep of the dead, with his head resting
on my knees.

VII

He was immediately allotted a special room, and also immediately, as the first measure, taken
to the bath, which was absolutely indispensable. All his garments, and his dagger and tall
kazák cap and hole-ridden shoes, were carefully laid away in the storehouse; clean linen was
put on him, slippers, and some of my clothing, which, as is always the case with paupers, exactly
fitted his build and stature. When he came to the table, washed, neat, fresh, he seemed so
much touched, and so happy, he was beaming all over with such joyful gratitude, that I felt
emotion and joy.... His face was completely transfigured. Little boys of twelve wear such faces
at Easter, after the Communion, when, thickly pomaded, clad in new round-jackets and starched
collars, they go to exchange the Easter greeting with their parents. Mísha kept feeling of
himself cautiously and incredulously, and repeating:--"What is this?... Am not I in heaven?"--And
on the following day he announced that he had not been able to sleep all night for rapture!

In my house there was then living an aged aunt with her niece. They were both greatly agitated
when they heard of Mísha's arrival; they did not understand how I could have invited him to
my house! He bore a very bad reputation. But, in the first place, I knew that he was always
very polite to ladies; and, in the second place, I trusted to his promise to reform. And, as
a matter of fact, during the early days of his sojourn under my roof Mísha not only justified
my expectations, but exceeded them; and he simply enchanted my ladies. He played picquet with
the old lady; he helped her to wind yarn; he showed her two new games of patience; he accompanied
the niece, who had a small voice, on the piano; he read her French and Russian poetry; he narrated
diverting but decorous anecdotes to both ladies;--in a word, he was serviceable to them in
all sorts of ways, so that they repeatedly expressed to me their surprise, while the old woman
even remarked: "How unjust people sometimes are!... What all have not they said about him ...
while he is so discreet and polite ... poor Mísha!"

It is true that at table "poor Mísha" licked his lips in a peculiarly-hasty way every time
he even looked at a bottle. But all I had to do was to shake my finger, and he would roll up
his eyes, and press his hand to his heart ... as much as to say: "I have sworn...."

"I am regenerated now!" he assured me.--"Well, God grant it!" I thought to myself.... But this
regeneration did not last long.

During the early days he was very loquacious and jolly. But beginning with the third day he
quieted down, somehow, although, as before, he kept close to the ladies and amused them. A
half-sad, half-thoughtful expression began to flit across his face, and the face itself grew
pale and thin.

"Art thou ill?" I asked him.

"Yes," he answered;--"my head aches a little."

On the fourth day he became perfectly silent; he sat in a corner most of the time, with dejectedly
drooping head; and by his downcast aspect evoked a feeling of compassion in the two ladies,
who now, in their turn, tried to divert him. At table he ate nothing, stared at his plate,
and rolled bread-balls. On the fifth day the feeling of pity in the ladies began to be replaced
by another--by distrust and even fear. Mísha had grown wild, he avoided people and kept walking
along the wall, as though creeping stealthily, and suddenly darting glances around him, as
though some one had called him. And what had become of his rosy complexion? It seemed to be
covered with earth.

"Art thou still ill?" I asked him.

"No; I am well," he answered abruptly.

"Art thou bored?"

"Why should I be bored?"--But he turned away and would not look me in the eye.

"Or hast thou grown melancholy again?"--To this he made no reply.

On the following day my aunt ran into my study in a state of great excitement, and declared
that she and her niece would leave my house if Mísha were to remain in it.

"Why so?"

"Why, we feel afraid of him.... He is not a man,--he is a wolf, a regular wolf. He stalks and
stalks about, saying never a word, and has such a wild look.... He all but gnashes his teeth.
My Kátya is such a nervous girl, as thou knowest.... She took a great interest in him the first
day.... I am afraid for her and for myself...."

I did not know what reply to make to my aunt. But I could not expel Mísha, whom I had invited in.

He himself extricated me from this dilemma.

That very day--before I had even left my study--I suddenly heard a dull and vicious voice behind
me.

"Nikolái Nikoláitch, hey there, Nikolái Nikoláitch!"

I looked round. In the doorway stood Mísha, with a terrible, lowering, distorted visage.

"Nikolái Nikoláitch," he repeated ... (it was no longer "dear uncle").

"What dost thou want?"

"Let me go ... this very moment!"

"What?"

"Let me go, or I shall commit a crime,--set the house on fire or cut some one's throat."--Mísha
suddenly fell to shaking.--"Order them to restore my garments, and give me a cart to carry
me to the highway, and give me a trifling sum of money!"

"But art thou dissatisfied with anything?" I began.

"I cannot live thus!" he roared at the top of his voice.--"I cannot live in your lordly, thrice-damned
house! I hate, I am ashamed to live so tranquilly!... How do you manage to endure it?!"

"In other words," I interposed, "thou wishest to say that thou canst not live without liquor...."

"Well, yes! well, yes!" he yelled again.--"Only let me go to my brethren, to my friends, to
the beggars!... Away from your noble, decorous, repulsive race!"

I wanted to remind him of his promise on oath, but the criminal expression of Mísha's face,
his unrestrained voice, the convulsive trembling of all his limbs--all this was so frightful
that I made haste to get rid of him. I informed him that he should receive his clothing at
once, that a cart should be harnessed for him; and taking from a casket a twenty-ruble bank-note,
I laid it on the table. Mísha was already beginning to advance threateningly upon me, but now
he suddenly stopped short, his face instantaneously became distorted, and flushed up; he smote
his breast, tears gushed from his eyes, and he stammered, --"Uncle!--Angel! I am a lost man,
you see!---Thanks! Thanks!"--He seized the bank-note and rushed out of the room.

An hour later he was already seated in a cart, again clad in his Circassian coat, again rosy
and jolly; and when the horses started off he uttered a yell, tore off his tall kazák cap,
and waving it above his head, he made bow after bow. Immediately before his departure he embraced
me long and warmly, stammering:--"Benefactor, benefactor!... It was impossible to save me!"
He even ran in to see the ladies, and kissed their hands over and over again, went down on
his knees, appealed to God, and begged forgiveness! I found Kátya in tears later on.

But the coachman who had driven Mísha reported to me, on his return, that he had taken him
to the first drinking establishment on the highway, and that there he "had got stranded," had
begun to stand treat to every one without distinction, and had soon arrived at a state of inebriation.

Since that time I have never met Mísha, but I learned his final fate in the following manner.

VIII

Three years later I again found myself in the country; suddenly a servant entered and announced
that Madame Pólteff was inquiring for me. I knew no Madame Pólteff, and the servant who made
the announcement was grinning in a sarcastic sort of way, for some reason or other. In reply
to my questioning glance he said that the lady who was asking for me was young, poorly clad,
and had arrived in a peasant-cart drawn by one horse which she was driving herself! I ordered
that Madame Pólteff should be requested to do me the favour to step into my study.

I beheld a woman of five-and-twenty,--belonging to the petty burgher class, to judge from her
attire,--with a large kerchief on her head. Her face was simple, rather round in contour, not
devoid of agreeability; her gaze was downcast and rather melancholy, her movements were embarrassed.

"Are you Madame Pólteff?" I asked, inviting her to be seated.

"Just so, sir," she answered, in a low voice, and without sitting down.--"I am the widow of
your nephew, Mikhaíl Andréevitch Pólteff."

"Is Mikhaíl Andréevitch dead? Has he been dead long?--But sit down, I beg of you."

She dropped down on a chair.

"This is the second month since he died."

"And were you married to him long ago?"

"I lived with him one year in all."

"And whence come you now?"

"I come from the vicinity of Túla.... There is a village there called Známenskoe-Glúshkovo--perhaps
you deign to know it. I am the daughter of the sexton there. Mikhaíl Andréitch and I lived
there.... He settled down with my father. We lived together a year in all." The young woman's
lips twitched slightly, and she raised her hand to them. She seemed to be getting ready to
cry, but conquered herself, and cleared her throat.

"The late Mikhaíl Andréitch, before his death," she went on, "bade me go to you. 'Be sure to
go,' he said. And he told me that I was to thank you for all your goodness, and transmit to
you ... this ... trifle" (she drew from her pocket a small package), "which he always carried
on his person.... And Mikhaíl Andréitch said, Wouldn't you be so kind as to accept it in memory--that
you must not scorn it.... 'I have nothing else to give him,' ... meaning you ... he said...."

In the packet was a small silver cup with the monogram of Mikhaíl's mother. This tiny cup I
had often seen in Mikhaíl's hands; and once he had even said to me, in speaking of a pauper,
that he must be stripped bare, since he had neither cup nor bowl, "while I have this here,"
he said.

I thanked her, took the cup and inquired, "Of what malady did Mikhaíl Andréitch die?--Probably...."

Here I bit my tongue, but the young woman understood my unspoken thought.... She darted a swift
glance at me, then dropped her eyes, smiled sadly, and immediately said, "Akh, no! He had abandoned
that entirely from the time he made my acquaintance.... Only, what health had he?!... It was
utterly ruined. As soon as he gave up drinking, his malady immediately manifested itself. He
became so steady, he was always wanting to help my father, either in the household affairs,
or in the vegetable garden ... or whatever other work happened to be on hand ... in spite of
the fact that he was of noble birth. Only, where was he to get the strength?... And he would
have liked to busy himself in the department of writing also,--he knew how to do that beautifully,
as you are aware; but his hands shook so, and he could not hold the pen properly.... He was
always reproaching himself: 'I'm an idle dog,' he said. 'I have done no one any good, I have
helped no one, I have not toiled!' He was very much afflicted over that same.... He used to
say, 'Our people toil, but what are we doing?...' Akh, Nikolái Nikoláitch, he was a fine man--and
he loved me ... and I.... Akh, forgive me...."

Here the young woman actually burst into tears. I would have liked to comfort her, but I did
not know how.

"Have you a baby?" I asked at last.

She sighed.--"No, I have not.... How could I have?"--And here tears streamed worse than before.

So this was the end of Mísha's wanderings through tribulations [old P. concluded his story].--You
will agree with me, gentlemen, as a matter of course, that I had a right to call him reckless;
but you will probably also agree with me that he did not resemble the reckless fellows of the
present day, although we must suppose that any philosopher would find traits of similarity
between him and them. In both cases there is the thirst for self-annihilation, melancholy,
dissatisfaction.... And what that springs from I will permit precisely that philosopher to decide.

THE DREAM

(1876)

I

I was living with my mother at the time, in a small seaport town. I was just turned seventeen,
and my mother was only thirty-five; she had married very young. When my father died I was only
seven years old; but I remembered him well. My mother was a short, fair-haired woman, with
a charming, but permanently-sad face, a quiet, languid voice, and timid movements. In her youth
she had borne the reputation of a beauty, and as long as she lived she remained attractive
and pretty. I have never beheld more profound, tender, and melancholy eyes. I adored her, and
she loved me.... But our life was not cheerful; it seemed as though some mysterious, incurable
and undeserved sorrow were constantly sapping the root of her existence. This sorrow could
not be explained by grief for my father alone, great as that was, passionately as my mother
had loved him, sacredly as she cherished his memory.... No! there was something else hidden
there which I did not understand, but which I felt,--felt confusedly and strongly as soon as
I looked at those quiet, impassive eyes, at those very beautiful but also impassive lips, which
were not bitterly compressed, but seemed to have congealed for good and all.

I have said that my mother loved me; but there were moments when she spurned me, when my presence
was burdensome, intolerable to her. At such times she felt, as it were, an involuntary aversion
for me--and was terrified afterward, reproaching herself with tears and clasping me to her
heart. I attributed these momentary fits of hostility to her shattered health, to her unhappiness....
These hostile sentiments might have been evoked, it is true, in a certain measure, by some
strange outbursts, which were incomprehensible even to me myself, of wicked and criminal feelings
which occasionally arose in me....

But these outbursts did not coincide with the moments of repulsion.--My mother constantly wore
black, as though she were in mourning. We lived on a rather grand scale, although we associated
with no one.

II

My mother concentrated upon me all her thoughts and cares. Her life was merged in my life.
Such relations between parents and children are not always good for the children ... they are
more apt to be injurious. Moreover I was my mother's only child ... and only children generally
develop irregularly. In rearing them the parents do not think of themselves so much as they
do of them.... That is not practical. I did not get spoiled, and did not grow obstinate (both
these things happen with only children), but my nerves were unstrung before their time; in
addition to which I was of rather feeble health--I took after my mother, to whom I also bore
a great facial resemblance. I shunned the society of lads of my own age; in general, I was
shy of people; I even talked very little with my mother. I was fonder of reading than of anything
else, and of walking alone--and dreaming, dreaming! What my dreams were about it would be difficult
to say. It sometimes seemed to me as though I were standing before a half-open door behind
which were concealed hidden secrets,--standing and waiting, and swooning with longing--yet
not crossing the threshold; and always meditating as to what there was yonder ahead of me--and
always waiting and longing ... or falling into slumber. If the poetic vein had throbbed in
me I should, in all probability, have taken to writing verses; if I had felt an inclination
to religious devoutness I might have become a monk; but there was nothing of the sort about
me, and I continued to dream--and to wait.

III

I have just mentioned that I sometimes fell asleep under the inspiration of obscure thoughts
and reveries. On the whole, I slept a great deal, and dreams played a prominent part in my
life; I beheld visions almost every night. I did not forget them, I attributed to them significance,
I regarded them as prophetic, I strove to divine their secret import. Some of them were repeated
from time to time, which always seemed to me wonderful and strange. I was particularly perturbed
by one dream. It seems to me that I am walking along a narrow, badly-paved street in an ancient
town, between many-storied houses of stone, with sharp-pointed roofs. I am seeking my father
who is not dead, but is, for some reason, hiding from us, and is living in one of those houses.
And so I enter a low, dark gate, traverse a long courtyard encumbered with beams and planks,
and finally make my way into a small chamber with two circular windows. In the middle of the
room stands my father, clad in a dressing-gown and smoking a pipe. He does not in the least
resemble my real father: he is tall, thin, black-haired, he has a hooked nose, surly, piercing
eyes; in appearance he is about forty years of age. He is displeased because I have hunted
him up; and I also am not in the least delighted at the meeting--and I stand still, in perplexity.
He turns away slightly, begins to mutter something and to pace to and fro with short steps....
Then he retreats a little, without ceasing to mutter, and keeps constantly casting glances
behind him, over his shoulder; the room widens out and vanishes in a fog.... I suddenly grow
terrified at the thought that I am losing my father again. I rush after him--but I no longer
see him, and can only hear his angry, bear-like growl.... My heart sinks within me. I wake
up, and for a long time cannot get to sleep again.... All the following day I think about that
dream and, of course, am unable to arrive at any conclusion.

IV

The month of June had come. The town in which my mother and I lived became remarkably animated
at that season. A multitude of vessels arrived at the wharves, a multitude of new faces presented
themselves on the streets. I loved at such times to stroll along the quay, past the coffee-houses
and inns, to scan the varied faces of the sailors and other people who sat under the canvas
awnings, at little white tables with pewter tankards filled with beer.

One day, as I was passing in front of a coffee-house, I caught sight of a man who immediately
engrossed my entire attention. Clad in a long black coat of peasant cut, with a straw hat pulled
down over his eyes, he was sitting motionless, with his arms folded on his chest. Thin rings
of black hair descended to his very nose; his thin lips gripped the stem of a short pipe. This
man seemed so familiar to me, every feature of his swarthy, yellow face, his whole figure,
were so indubitably stamped on my memory, that I could not do otherwise than halt before him,
could not help putting to myself the question: "Who is this man? Where have I seen him?" He
probably felt my intent stare, for he turned his black, piercing eyes upon me.... I involuntarily
uttered a cry of surprise....

This man was the father whom I had sought out, whom I had beheld in my dream!

There was no possibility of making a mistake,--the resemblance was too striking. Even the long-skirted
coat, which enveloped his gaunt limbs, reminded me, in colour and form, of the dressing-gown
in which my father had presented himself to me.

"Am not I dreaming?" I thought to myself.... "No.... It is daylight now, a crowd is roaring
round me, the sun is shining brightly in the blue sky, and I have before me, not a phantom,
but a living man."

I stepped up to an empty table, ordered myself a tankard of beer and a newspaper, and seated
myself at a short distance from this mysterious being.

V

Placing the sheets of the newspaper on a level with my face, I continued to devour the stranger
with my eyes.--He hardly stirred, and only raised his drooping head a little from time to time.
He was evidently waiting for some one. I gazed and gazed.... Sometimes it seemed to me that
I had invented the whole thing, that in reality there was no resemblance whatever, that I had
yielded to the semi-involuntary deception of the imagination ... but "he" would suddenly turn
a little on his chair, raise his hand slightly, and again I almost cried aloud, again I beheld
before me my "nocturnal" father! At last he noticed my importunate attention, and, first with
surprise, then with vexation, he glanced in my direction, started to rise, and knocked down
a small cane which he had leaned against the table. I instantly sprang to my feet, picked it
up and handed it to him. My heart was beating violently.

He smiled in a constrained way, thanked me, and putting his face close to my face, he elevated
his eyebrows and parted his lips a little, as though something had struck him.

"You are very polite, young man," he suddenly began, in a dry, sharp, snuffling voice.--"That
is a rarity nowadays. Allow me to congratulate you. You have been well brought up."

I do not remember precisely what answer I made to him; but the conversation between us was
started. I learned that he was a fellow-countryman of mine, that he had recently returned from
America, where he had lived many years, and whither he was intending to return shortly. He
said his name was Baron.... I did not catch the name well. He, like my "nocturnal" father,
wound up each of his remarks with an indistinct, inward growl. He wanted to know my name....
On hearing it he again showed signs of surprise. Then he asked me if I had been living long
in that town, and with whom? I answered him that I lived with my mother.

"And your father?"

"My father died long ago."

He inquired my mother's Christian name, and immediately burst into an awkward laugh--and then
excused himself, saying that he had that American habit, and that altogether he was a good
deal of an eccentric. Then he asked where we lived. I told him.

VI

The agitation which had seized upon me at the beginning of our conversation had gradually subsided;
I thought our intimacy rather strange--that was all. I did not like the smile with which the
baron questioned me; neither did I like the expression of his eyes when he fairly stabbed them
into me.... There was about them something rapacious and condescending ... something which
inspired dread. I had not seen those eyes in my dream. The baron had a strange face! It was
pallid, fatigued, and, at the same time, youthful in appearance, but with a disagreeable youthfulness!
Neither had my "nocturnal" father that deep scar, which intersected his whole forehead in a
slanting direction, and which I did not notice until I moved closer to him.

Before I had had time to impart to the baron the name of the street and the number of the house
where we lived, a tall negro, wrapped up in a cloak to his very eyes, approached him from behind
and tapped him softly on the shoulder. The baron turned round, said: "Aha! At last!" and nodding
lightly to me, entered the coffee-house with the negro. I remained under the awning. I wished
to wait until the baron should come out again, not so much for the sake of entering again into
conversation with him (I really did not know what topic I could start with), as for the purpose
of again verifying my first impression.--But half an hour passed; an hour passed.... The baron
did not make his appearance. I entered the coffee-house, I made the circuit of all the rooms--but
nowhere did I see either the baron or the negro.... Both of them must have taken their departure
through the back door.

My head had begun to ache a little, and with the object of refreshing myself I set out along
the seashore to the extensive park outside the town, which had been laid out ten years previously.
After having strolled for a couple of hours in the shade of the huge oaks and plaintain-trees,
I returned home.

VII

Our maid-servant flew to meet me, all tremulous with agitation, as soon as I made my appearance
in the anteroom. I immediately divined, from the expression of her face, that something unpleasant
had occurred in our house during my absence.--And, in fact, I learned that half an hour before
a frightful shriek had rung out from my mother's bedroom. When the maid rushed in she found
her on the floor in a swoon which lasted for several minutes. My mother had recovered consciousness
at last, but had been obliged to go to bed, and wore a strange, frightened aspect; she had
not uttered a word, she had not replied to questions--she had done nothing but glance around
her and tremble. The servant had sent the gardener for a doctor. The doctor had come and had
prescribed a soothing potion, but my mother had refused to say anything to him either. The
gardener asserted that a few moments after the shriek had rung out from my mother's room he
had seen a strange man run hastily across the flower-plots of the garden to the street gate.
(We lived in a one-story house, whose windows looked out upon a fairly large garden.) The gardener
had not been able to get a good look at the man's face; but the latter was gaunt, and wore
a straw hat and a long-skirted coat.... "The baron's costume!" immediately flashed into my
head.--The gardener had been unable to overtake him; moreover, he had been summoned, without
delay, to the house and despatched for the doctor.

I went to my mother's room; she was lying in bed, whiter than the pillow on which her head
rested.... At sight of me she smiled faintly, and put out her hand to me. I sat down by her
side, and began to question her; at first she persistently parried my questions; but at last
she confessed that she had seen something which had frightened her greatly.

"Did some one enter here?" I asked.

"No," she answered hastily, "no one entered, but it seemed to me ... I thought I saw ... a
vision...."

She ceased speaking and covered her eyes with her hand. I was on the point of communicating
to her what I had heard from the gardener--and my meeting with the baron also, by the way ...
but, for some reason or other, the words died on my lips.

Nevertheless I did bring myself to remark to my mother that visions do not manifest themselves
in the daylight....

"Stop," she whispered, "please stop; do not torture me now. Some day thou shalt know...." Again
she relapsed into silence. Her hands were cold, and her pulse beat fast and unevenly. I gave
her a dose of her medicine and stepped a little to one side, in order not to disturb her.

She did not rise all day. She lay motionless and quiet, only sighing deeply from time to time,
and opening her eyes in a timorous fashion.--Every one in the house was perplexed.

VIII

Toward night a slight fever made its appearance, and my mother sent me away. I did not go to
my own chamber, however, but lay down in the adjoining room on the divan. Every quarter of
an hour I rose, approached the door on tiptoe, and listened.... Everything remained silent--but
my mother hardly slept at all that night. When I went into her room early in the morning her
face appeared to me to be swollen, and her eyes were shining with an unnatural brilliancy.
In the course of the day she became a little easier, but toward evening the fever increased again.

Up to that time she had maintained an obstinate silence, but now she suddenly began to talk
in a hurried, spasmodic voice. She was not delirious, there was sense in her words, but there
was no coherency in them. Not long before midnight she raised herself up in bed with a convulsive
movement (I was sitting beside her), and with the same hurried voice she began to narrate to
me, continually drinking water in gulps from a glass, feebly flourishing her hands, and not
once looking at me the while.... At times she paused, exerted an effort over herself, and went
on again.... All this was strange, as though she were doing it in her sleep, as though she
herself were not present, but as though some other person were speaking with her lips, or making
her speak.

IX

"Listen to what I have to tell thee," she began. "Thou art no longer a young boy; thou must
know all. I had a good friend.... She married a man whom she loved with all her heart, and
she was happy with her husband. But during the first year of their married life they both went
to the capital to spend a few weeks and enjoy themselves. They stopped at a good hotel and
went out a great deal to theatres and assemblies. My friend was very far from homely; every
one noticed her, all the young men paid court to her; but among them was one in particular
... an officer. He followed her unremittingly, and wherever she went she beheld his black,
wicked eyes. He did not make her acquaintance, and did not speak to her even once; he merely
kept staring at her in a very strange, insolent way. All the pleasures of the capital were
poisoned by his presence. She began to urge her husband to depart as speedily as possible,
and they had fully made up their minds to the journey. One day her husband went off to the
club; some officers--officers who belonged to the same regiment as this man--had invited him
to play cards.... For the first time she was left alone. Her husband did not return for a long
time; she dismissed her maid and went to bed.... And suddenly a great dread came upon her,
so that she even turned cold all over and began to tremble. It seemed to her that she heard
a faint tapping on the other side of the wall--like the noise a dog makes when scratching--and
she began to stare at that wall. In the corner burned a shrine-lamp; the chamber was all hung
with silken stuff.... Suddenly something began to move at that point, rose, opened.... And
straight out of the wall, all black and long, stepped forth that dreadful man with the wicked eyes!

"She tried to scream and could not. She was benumbed with fright. He advanced briskly toward
her, like a rapacious wild beast, flung something over her head, something stifling, heavy
and white.... What happened afterward I do not remember.... I do not remember! It was like
death, like murder.... When that terrible fog dispersed at last--when I ... my friend recovered
her senses, there was no one in the room. Again--and for a long time--she was incapable of
crying out, but she did shriek at last ... then again everything grew confused....

"Then she beheld by her side her husband, who had been detained at the club until two o'clock....
His face was distorted beyond recognition. He began to question her, but she said nothing....
Then she fell ill.... But I remember that when she was left alone in the room she examined
that place in the wall.... Under the silken hangings there proved to be a secret door. And
her wedding-ring had disappeared from her hand. This ring was of an unusual shape. Upon it
seven tiny golden stars alternated with seven tiny silver stars; it was an ancient family heirloom.
Her husband asked her what had become of her ring; she could make no reply. Her husband thought
that she had dropped it somewhere, hunted everywhere for it, but nowhere could he find it.
Gloom descended upon him, he decided to return home as speedily as possible, and as soon as
the doctor permitted they quitted the capital.... But imagine! On the very day of their departure
they suddenly encountered, on the street, a litter.... In that litter lay a man who had just
been killed, with a cleft skull---and just imagine! that man was that same dreadful nocturnal
visitor with the wicked eyes.... He had been killed over a game of cards!

"Then my friend went away to the country, and became a mother for the first time ... and lived
several years with her husband. He never learned anything about that matter, and what could
she say? She herself knew nothing. But her former happiness had vanished. Darkness had invaded
their life--and that darkness was never dispelled.... They had no other children either before
or after ... but that son...."

My mother began to tremble all over, and covered her face with her hands.

"But tell me now," she went on, with redoubled force, "whether my friend was in any way to
blame? With what could she reproach herself? She was punished, but had not she the right to
declare, in the presence of God himself, that the punishment which overtook her was unjust?
Then why can the past present itself to her, after the lapse of so many years, in so frightful
an aspect, as though she were a sinner tortured by the gnawings of conscience? Macbeth slew
Banquo, so it is not to be wondered at that he should have visions ... but I...."

But my mother's speech became so entangled and confused that I ceased to understand her ...
I no longer had any doubt that she was raving in delirium.

X

Any one can easily understand what a shattering effect my mother's narration produced upon
me! I had divined, at her very first word, that she was speaking of herself, and not of any
acquaintance of hers; her slip of the tongue only confirmed me in my surmise. So it really
was my father whom I had sought out in my dream, whom I had beheld when wide awake! He had
not been killed, as my mother had supposed, but merely wounded.... And he had come to her,
and had fled, affrighted by her fright. Everything suddenly became clear to me; the feeling
of involuntary repugnance for me which sometimes awoke in my mother, and her constant sadness,
and our isolated life.... I remember that my head reeled, and I clutched at it with both hands,
as though desirous of holding it firmly in its place. But one thought had become riveted in
it like a nail. I made up my mind, without fail, at any cost, to find that man again! Why?
With what object?--I did not account to myself for that; but to find him ... to find him--that
had become for me a question of life or death!

On the following morning my mother regained her composure at last ... the fever passed off
... she fell asleep. Committing her to the care of our landlord and landlady and the servants,
I set out on my quest.

XI

First of all, as a matter of course, I betook myself to the coffee-house where I had met the
baron; but in the coffee-house no one knew him or had even noticed him; he was a chance visitor.
The proprietors had noticed the negro--his figure had been too striking to escape notice; but
who he was, where he stayed, no one knew either. Leaving my address, in case of an emergency,
at the coffee-house, I began to walk about the streets and the water-front of the town, the
wharves, the boulevards; I looked into all the public institutions, and nowhere did I find
any one who resembled either the baron or his companion.... As I had not caught the baron's
name, I was deprived of the possibility of appealing to the police; but I privately gave two
or three guardians of public order to understand (they gazed at me in surprise, it is true,
and did not entirely believe me) that I would lavishly reward their zeal if they should be
successful in coming upon the traces of those two individuals, whose personal appearance I
tried to describe as minutely as possible.

Having strolled about in this manner until dinner-time, I returned home thoroughly worn out.
My mother had got out of bed; but with her habitual melancholy there was mingled a new element,
a sort of pensive perplexity, which cut me to the heart like a knife. I sat with her all the
evening. We said hardly anything; she laid out her game of patience, I silently looked at her
cards. She did not refer by a single word to her story, or to what had happened the day before.
It was as though we had both entered into a compact not to touch upon those strange and terrifying
occurrences.... She appeared to be vexed with herself and ashamed of what had involuntarily
burst from her; but perhaps she did not remember very clearly what she had said in her semi-fevered
delirium, and hoped that I would spare her.... And, in fact, I did spare her, and she was conscious
of it; as on the preceding day she avoided meeting my eyes.

A frightful storm had suddenly sprung up out of doors. The wind howled and tore in wild gusts,
the window-panes rattled and quivered; despairing shrieks and groans were borne through the
air, as though something on high had broken loose and were flying with mad weeping over the
shaking houses. Just before dawn I lost myself in a doze ... when suddenly it seemed to me
as though some one had entered my room and called me, had uttered my name, not in a loud, but
in a decided voice. I raised my head and saw no one; but, strange to relate! I not only was
not frightened--I was delighted; there suddenly arose within me the conviction that now I should,
without fail, attain my end. I hastily dressed myself and left the house.

XII

The storm had subsided ... but its last flutterings could still be felt. It was early; there
were no people in the streets; in many places fragments of chimneys, tiles, boards of fences
which had been rent asunder, the broken boughs of trees, lay strewn upon the ground.... "What
happened at sea last night?" I involuntarily thought at the sight of the traces left behind
by the storm. I started to go to the port, but my feet bore me in another direction, as though
in obedience to an irresistible attraction. Before ten minutes had passed I found myself in
a quarter of the town which I had never yet visited. I was walking, not fast, but without stopping,
step by step, with a strange sensation at my heart; I was expecting something remarkable, impossible,
and, at the same time, I was convinced that that impossible thing would come to pass.

XIII

And lo, it came to pass, that remarkable, that unexpected thing! Twenty paces in front of me
I suddenly beheld that same negro who had spoken to the baron in my presence at the coffee-house!
Enveloped in the same cloak which I had then noticed on him, he seemed to have popped up out
of the earth, and with his back turned toward me was walking with brisk strides along the narrow
sidewalk of the crooked alley! I immediately dashed in pursuit of him, but he redoubled his
gait, although he did not glance behind him, and suddenly made an abrupt turn around the corner
of a projecting house. I rushed to that corner and turned it as quickly as the negro had done....
Marvellous to relate! Before me stretched a long, narrow, and perfectly empty street; the morning
mist filled it with its dim, leaden light,--but my gaze penetrated to its very extremity. I
could count all its buildings ... and not a single living being was anywhere astir! The tall
negro in the cloak had vanished as suddenly as he had appeared! I was amazed ... but only for
a moment. Another feeling immediately took possession of me; that street which stretched out
before my eyes, all dumb and dead, as it were,--I recognised it! It was the street of my dream.
I trembled and shivered--the morning was so chilly--and instantly, without the slightest wavering,
with a certain terror of confidence, I went onward.

I began to seek with my eyes.... Yes, there it is, yonder, on the right, with a corner projecting
on the sidewalk--yonder is the house of my dream, yonder is the ancient gate with the stone
scrolls on each side.... The house is not circular, it is true, but square ... but that is
a matter of no importance.... I knock at the gate, I knock once, twice, thrice, ever more and
more loudly.... The gate opens slowly, with a heavy screech, as though yawning. In front of
me stands a young serving-maid with a dishevelled head and sleepy eyes. She has evidently just
waked up.

"Does the baron live here?" I inquire, as I run a swift glance over the deep, narrow courtyard....
It is there; it is all there ... there are the planks which I had seen in my dream.

"No," the maid answers me, "the baron does not live here."

"What dost thou mean by that? It is impossible!"

"He is not here now. He went away yesterday."

"Whither?"

"To America."

"To America!" I involuntarily repeated. "But he is coming back?"

The maid looked suspiciously at me.

"I don't know. Perhaps he will not come back at all."

"But has he been living here long?"

"No, not long; about a week. Now he is not here at all."

"But what was the family name of that baron?"

The maid-servant stared at me.

"Don't you know his name? We simply called him the baron. Hey, there! Piótr!" she cried, perceiving
that I was pushing my way in.--"come hither: some stranger or other is asking all sorts of
questions."

From the house there presented itself the shambling figure of a robust labourer.

"What's the matter? What's wanted?" he inquired in a hoarse voice,--and having listened to
me with a surly mien, he repeated what the maid-servant had said.

"But who does live here?" I said.

"Our master."

"And who is he?"

"A carpenter. They are all carpenters in this street."

"Can he be seen?"

"Impossible now, he is asleep."

"And cannot I go into the house?"

"No; go your way."

"Well, and can I see your master a little later?"

"Why not? Certainly. He can always be seen.... That's his business as a dealer. Only, go your
way now. See how early it is."

"Well, and how about that negro?" I suddenly asked.

The labourer stared in amazement, first at me, then at the maid-servant.

"What negro?" he said at last.--"Go away, sir. You can come back later. Talk with the master."

I went out into the street. The gate was instantly banged behind me, heavily and sharply, without
squeaking this time.

I took good note of the street and house and went away, but not home.--I felt something in
the nature of disenchantment. Everything which had happened to me was so strange, so remarkable--and
yet, how stupidly it had been ended! I had been convinced that I should behold in that house
the room which was familiar to me--and in the middle of it my father, the baron, in a dressing-gown
and with a pipe.... And instead of that, the master of the house was a carpenter, and one might
visit him as much as one pleased,--and order furniture of him if one wished!

But my father had gone to America! And what was left for me to do now?... Tell my mother everything,
or conceal forever the very memory of that meeting? I was absolutely unable to reconcile myself
to the thought that such a senseless, such a commonplace ending should be tacked on to such
a supernatural, mysterious beginning!

I did not wish to return home, and walked straight ahead, following my nose, out of the town.

XIV

I walked along with drooping head, without a thought, almost without sensation, but wholly
engrossed in myself.--A measured, dull and angry roar drew me out of my torpor. I raised my
head: it was the sea roaring and booming fifty paces from me. Greatly agitated by the nocturnal
storm, the sea was a mass of white-caps to the very horizon, and steep crests of long breakers
were rolling in regularly and breaking on the flat shore, I approached it, and walked along
the very line left by the ebb and flow on the yellow, ribbed sand, strewn with fragments of
trailing seawrack, bits of shells, serpent-like ribbons of eel-grass. Sharp-winged gulls with
pitiful cry, borne on the wind from the distant aerial depths, soared white as snow against
the grey, cloudy sky, swooped down abruptly, and as though skipping from wave to wave, departed
again and vanished like silvery flecks in the strips of swirling foam. Some of them, I noticed,
circled persistently around a large isolated boulder which rose aloft in the midst of the monotonous
expanse of sandy shores. Coarse seaweed grew in uneven tufts on one side of the rock; and at
the point where its tangled stems emerged from the yellow salt-marsh, there was something black,
and long, and arched, and not very large.... I began to look more intently.... Some dark object
was lying there--lying motionless beside the stone.... That object became constantly clearer
and more distinct the nearer I approached....

I was only thirty paces from the rock now.... Why, that was the outline of a human body! It
was a corpse; it was a drowned man, cast up by the sea! I went clear up to the rock.

It was the corpse of the baron, my father! I stopped short, as though rooted to the spot. Then
only did I understand that ever since daybreak I had been guided by some unknown forces--that
I was in their power,--and for the space of several minutes there was nothing in my soul save
the ceaseless crashing of the sea, and a dumb terror in the presence of the Fate which held
me in its grip....

XV

He was lying on his back, bent a little to one side, with his left arm thrown above his head
... the right was turned under his bent body. The sticky slime had sucked in the tips of his
feet, shod in tall sailor's boots; the short blue pea-jacket, all impregnated with sea-salt,
had not unbuttoned; a red scarf encircled his neck in a hard knot. The swarthy face, turned
skyward, seemed to be laughing; from beneath the upturned upper lip small close-set teeth were
visible; the dim pupils of the half-closed eyes were hardly to be distinguished from the darkened
whites; covered with bubbles of foam the dirt-encrusted hair spread out over the ground and
laid bare the smooth forehead with the purplish line of the scar; the narrow nose rose up like
a sharp, white streak between the sunken cheeks. The storm of the past night had done its work....
He had not beheld America! The man who had insulted my mother, who had marred her life, my
father--yes! my father, I could cherish no doubt as to that--lay stretched out helpless in
the mud at my feet. I experienced a sense of satisfied vengeance, and compassion, and repulsion,
and terror most of all ... of twofold terror; terror of what I had seen, and of what had come
to pass. That evil, that criminal element of which I have already spoken, those incomprehensible
spasms rose up within me ... stifled me.

"Aha!" I thought to myself: "so that is why I am what I am.... That is where blood tells!"
I stood beside the corpse and gazed and waited, to see whether those dead pupils would not
stir, whether those benumbed lips would not quiver. No! everything was motionless; the very
seaweed, among which the surf had cast him, seemed to have congealed; even the gulls had flown
away--there was not a fragment anywhere, not a plank or any broken rigging. There was emptiness
everywhere ... only he--and I--and the foaming sea in the distance. I cast a glance behind
me; the same emptiness was there; a chain of hillocks on the horizon ... that was all!

I dreaded to leave that unfortunate man in that loneliness, in the ooze of the shore, to be
devoured by fishes and birds; an inward voice told me that I ought to hunt up some men and
call them thither, if not to aid--that was out of the question--at least for the purpose of
laying him out, of bearing him beneath an inhabited roof.... But indescribable terror suddenly
took possession of me. It seemed to me as though that dead man knew that I had come thither,
that he himself had arranged that last meeting--it even seemed as though I could hear that
dull, familiar muttering.... I ran off to one side ... looked behind me once more.... Something
shining caught my eye; it brought me to a standstill. It was a golden hoop on the outstretched
hand of the corpse.... I recognised my mother's wedding-ring. I remember how I forced myself
to return, to go close, to bend down.... I remember the sticky touch of the cold fingers, I
remember how I panted and puckered up my eyes and gnashed my teeth, as I tugged persistently
at the ring....

At last I got it off--and I fled--fled away, in headlong flight,--and something darted after
me, and overtook me and caught me.

XVI

Everything which I had gone through and endured was, probably, written on my face when I returned
home. My mother suddenly rose upright as soon as I entered her room, and gazed at me with such
insistent inquiry that, after having unsuccessfully attempted to explain myself, I ended by
silently handing her the ring. She turned frightfully pale, her eyes opened unusually wide
and turned dim like his.--She uttered a faint cry, seized the ring, reeled, fell upon my breast,
and fairly swooned there, with her head thrown back and devouring me with those wide, mad eyes.
I encircled her waist with both arms, and standing still on one spot, never stirring, I slowly
narrated everything, without the slightest reservation, to her, in a quiet voice: my dream
and the meeting, and everything, everything.... She heard me out to the end, only her breast
heaved more and more strongly, and her eyes suddenly grew more animated and drooped. Then she
put the ring on her fourth finger, and, retreating a little, began to get out a mantilla and
a hat. I asked where she was going. She raised a surprised glance to me and tried to answer,
but her voice failed her. She shuddered several times, rubbed her hands as though endeavouring
to warm herself, and at last she said: "Let us go at once thither."

"Whither, mother dear?"

"Where he is lying.... I want to see ... I want to know ... I shall identify...."

I tried to persuade her not to go; but she was almost in hysterics. I understood that it was
impossible to oppose her desire, and we set out.

XVII

And lo, again I am walking over the sand of the dunes, but I am no longer alone, I am walking
arm in arm with my mother. The sea has retreated, has gone still further away; it is quieting
down; but even its diminished roar is menacing and ominous. Here, at last, the solitary rock
has shown itself ahead of us--and there is the seaweed. I look intently, I strive to distinguish
that rounded object lying on the ground--but I see nothing. We approach closer. I involuntarily
retard my steps. But where is that black, motionless thing? Only the stalks of the seaweed
stand out darkly against the sand, which is already dry.... We go to the very rock.... The
corpse is nowhere to be seen, and only on the spot where it had lain there still remains a
depression, and one can make out where the arms and legs lay.... Round about the seaweed seems
tousled, and the traces of one man's footsteps are discernible; they go across the down, then
disappear on reaching the flinty ridge.

My mother and I exchange glances and are ourselves frightened at what we read on our own faces....

Can he have got up of himself and gone away?

"But surely thou didst behold him dead?" she asks in a whisper.

I can only nod my head. Three hours have not elapsed since I stumbled upon the baron's body....
Some one had discovered it and carried it away.--I must find out who had done it, and what
had become of him.

But first of all I must attend to my mother.

XVIII

While she was on her way to the fatal spot she was in a fever, but she controlled herself.
The disappearance of the corpse had startled her as the crowning misfortune. She was stupefied.
I feared for her reason. With great difficulty I got her home. I put her to bed again; again
I called the doctor for her; but as soon as my mother partly recovered her senses she at once
demanded that I should instantly set out in search of "that man." I obeyed. But, despite all
possible measures, I discovered nothing. I went several times to the police-office, I visited
all the villages in the neighbourhood, I inserted several advertisements in the newspapers,
I made inquiries in every direction--all in vain! It is true that I did hear that a drowned
man had been found at one of the hamlets on the seashore.... I immediately hastened thither,
but he was already buried, and from all the tokens he did not resemble the baron. I found out
on what ship he had sailed for America. At first every one was positive that that ship had
perished during the tempest; but several months afterward rumours began to circulate to the
effect that it had been seen at anchor in the harbour of New York. Not knowing what to do,
I set about hunting up the negro whom I had seen.--I offered him, through the newspapers, a
very considerable sum of money if he would present himself at our house. A tall negro in a
cloak actually did come to the house in my absence.... But after questioning the servant-maid,
he suddenly went away and returned no more.

And thus the trace of my ... my father grew cold; thus did it vanish irrevocably in the mute
gloom. My mother and I never spoke of him. Only, one day, I remember that she expressed surprise
at my never having alluded before to my strange dream; and then she added: "Of course, it really
..." and did not finish her sentence.

My mother was ill for a long time, and after her convalescence our former relations were not
reëstablished. She felt awkward in my presence until the day of her death.... Precisely that,
awkward. And there was no way of helping her in her grief. Everything becomes smoothed down,
the memories of the most tragic family events gradually lose their force and venom; but if
a feeling of awkwardness has been set up between two closely-connected persons, it is impossible
to extirpate it!

I have never again had that dream which had been wont so to disturb me; I no longer "search
for" my father; but it has sometimes seemed to me--and it seems so to me to this day--that
in my sleep I hear distant shrieks, unintermittent, melancholy plaints; they resound somewhere
behind a lofty wall, across which it is impossible to clamber; they rend my heart--and I am
utterly unable to comprehend what it is: whether it is a living man groaning, or whether I
hear the wild, prolonged roar of the troubled sea. And now it passes once more into that beast-like
growl--and I awake with sadness and terror in my soul.

FATHER ALEXYÉI'S STORY

(1877)

Twenty years ago I was obliged--in my capacity of private inspector--to make the circuit of
all my aunt's rather numerous estates. The parish priests, with whom I regarded it as my duty
to make acquaintance, proved to be individuals of pretty much one pattern, and made after one
model, as it were. At length, in about the last of the estates which I was inspecting, I hit
upon a priest who did not resemble his brethren. He was a very aged man, almost decrepit; and
had it not been for the urgent entreaties of his parishioners, who loved and respected him,
he would long before have petitioned to be retired that he might rest. Two peculiarities impressed
me in Father Alexyéi (that was the priest's name). In the first place, he not only asked nothing
for himself but announced plainly that he required nothing; and, in the second place, I have
never beheld in any human face a more sorrowful, thoroughly indifferent--what is called an
"overwhelmed"--expression. The features of that face were of the ordinary rustic type: a wrinkled
forehead, small grey eyes, a large nose, a wedge-shaped beard, a swarthy, sunburned skin....
But the expression! ... the expression!... In that dim gaze life barely burned, and sadly at
that; and his voice also was, somehow, lifeless and dim.

I fell ill and kept my bed for several days. Father Alexyéi dropped in to see me in the evenings,
not to chat, but to play "fool."[16] The game of cards seemed to divert him more than it did
me. One day, after having been left "the fool" several times in succession (which delighted
Father Alexyéi not a little), I turned the conversation on his past life, on the afflictions
which had left on him such manifest traces. Father Alexyéi remained obdurate for a long time
at first, but ended by relating to me his story. He must have taken a liking to me for some
reason or other. Otherwise he would not have been so frank with me.

I shall endeavour to transmit his story in his own words. Father Alexyéi talked very simply
and intelligently, without any seminary or provincial tricks and turns of speech. It was not
the first time I had noticed that Russians, of all classes and callings, who have been violently
shattered and humbled express themselves precisely in such language.

... I had a good and sedate wife [thus he began], I loved her heartily, and we begat eight
children. One of my sons became a bishop, and died not so very long ago, in his diocese. I
shall now tell you about my other son,--Yákoff was his name. I sent him to the seminary in
the town of T----, and soon began to receive the most comforting reports about him. He was
the best pupil in all the branches! Even at home, in his boyhood, he had been distinguished
for his diligence and discretion; a whole day would sometimes pass without one's hearing him
... he would be sitting all the time over his book, reading. He never caused me and my wife[17]
the slightest displeasure; he was a meek lad. Only sometimes he was thoughtful beyond his years,
and his health was rather weak. Once something remarkable happened to him. He left the house
at daybreak, on St. Peter's day,[18] and was gone almost all the morning. At last he returned.
My wife and I ask him: "Where hast thou been?"

"I have been for a ramble in the forest," says he, "and there I met a certain little green
old man, who talked a great deal with me, and gave me such savoury nuts!"

"What little green old man art thou talking about?" we ask him.

"I don't know," says he; "I never saw him before. He was a little old man with a hump, and
he kept shifting from one to the other of his little feet, and laughing--and he was all green,
just like a leaf."

"What," say we, "and was his face green also?"

"Yes, his face, and his hair, and even his eyes."

Our son had never lied to us; but this time my wife and I had our doubts.

"Thou must have fallen asleep in the forest, in the heat of the day, and have seen that old
man in thy dreams."

"I wasn't asleep at all," says he. "Why, don't you believe me?" says he. "See here, I have
one of the nuts left in my pocket."

Yákoff pulled the nut out of his pocket and showed it to us.--The kernel was small, in the
nature of a chestnut, and rather rough; it did not resemble our ordinary nuts. I laid it aside,
and intended to show it to the doctor ... but it got lost.... I did not find it again.

Well, sir, so we sent him to the seminary, and, as I have already informed you, he rejoiced
us by his success. So my spouse and I assumed that he would turn out a fine man! When he came
for a sojourn at home it was a pleasure to look at him; he was so comely, and there was no
mischief about him;--every one liked him, every one congratulated us. Only he was still rather
thin of body, and there was no real good rosiness in his face. So then, he was already in his
nineteenth year, and his education would soon be finished. When suddenly we receive from him
a letter.--He writes to us: "Dear father and mother, be not wroth with me, permit me to be
a layman;[19] my heart does not incline to the ecclesiastical profession, I dread the responsibility,
I am afraid I shall sin--doubts have taken hold upon me! Without your parental permission and
blessing I shall venture on nothing--but one thing I will tell you; I am afraid of myself,
for I have begun to think a great deal."

I assure you, my dear sir, that this letter made me very sad,--as though a boar-spear had pricked
my heart,--for I saw that I should have no one to take my place![20] My eldest son was a monk;
and this one wanted to abandon his vocation altogether. I was also pained because priests from
our family have lived in our parish for close upon two hundred years. But I thought to myself:
"There's no use in kicking against the pricks; evidently, so it was predestined for him. What
sort of a pastor would he be if he has admitted doubt to his mind?" I took counsel with my
wife, and wrote to him in the following sense:

"Think it over well, my son Yákoff; measure ten times before you cut off once--there are great
difficulties in the worldly service, cold and hunger, and scorn for our caste! And thou must
know beforehand that no one will lend a hand to aid; so see to it that thou dost not repine
afterward. My desire, as thou knowest, has always been that thou shouldst succeed me; but if
thou really hast come to cherish doubts as to thy calling and hast become unsteady in the faith,
then it is not my place to restrain thee. The Lord's will be done! Thy mother and I will not
refuse thee our blessing."

Yákoff answered me with a grateful letter. "Thou hast rejoiced me, dear father," said he. "It
is my intention to devote myself to the profession of learning, and I have some protection;
I shall enter the university and become a doctor, for I feel a strong bent for science." I
read Yáshka's letter and became sadder than before; but I did not share my grief with any one.
My old woman caught a severe cold about that time and died--from that same cold, or the Lord
took her to Himself because He loved her, I know not which. I used to weep and weep because
I was a lonely widower--but what help was there for that?[21] So it had to be, you know. And
I would have been glad to go into the earth ... but it is hard ... it will not open. And I
was expecting my son; for he had notified me: "Before I go to Moscow," he said, "I shall look
in at home." And he did come to the parental roof, but did not remain there long. It seemed
as though something were urging him on; he would have liked, apparently, to fly on wings to
Moscow, to his beloved university! I began to question him as to his doubts. "What was the
cause of them?" I asked. But I did not get much out of him. One idea had pushed itself into
his head, and that was the end of it! "I want to help my neighbours," he said.--Well, sir,
he left me. I don't believe he took a penny with him, only a few clothes. He had such reliance
on himself! And not without reason. He passed an excellent examination, matriculated as student,
obtained lessons in private houses.... He was very strong on the ancient languages! And what
think you? He took it into his head to send me money. I cheered up a little,--not on account
of the money, of course,--I sent that back to him, and even scolded him; but I cheered up because
I saw that the young fellow would make his way in the world. But my rejoicing did not last long....

He came to me for his first vacation.... And, what marvel is this? I do not recognise my Yákoff!
He had grown so tiresome and surly,--you couldn't get a word out of him. And his face had changed
also: he had grown about ten years older. He had been taciturn before, there's no denying that!
At the slightest thing he would grow shy and blush like a girl.... But when he raised his eyes,
you could see that all was bright in his soul! But now it was quite different. He was not shy,
but he held aloof, like a wolf, and was always looking askance. He had neither a smile nor
a greeting for any one--he was just like a stone! If I undertook to interrogate him, he would
either remain silent or snarl. I began to wonder whether he had taken to drink--which God forbid!--or
had conceived a passion for cards; or whether something in the line of a weakness for women
had happened to him. In youth love-longings act powerfully,--well, and in such a large city
as Moscow bad examples and occasions are not lacking. But no; nothing of that sort was discernible.
His drink was kvas[22] and water; he never looked at the female sex--and had no intercourse
with people in general. And what was most bitter of all to me, he did not have his former confidence
in me; a sort of indifference had made its appearance, just as though everything belonging
to him had become loathsome to him. I turned the conversation on the sciences, on the university,
but even there could get no real answer. He went to church, but he was not devoid of peculiarities
there also; everywhere he was grim and scowling, but in church he seemed always to be grinning.

After this fashion he spent six weeks with me, then went back to Moscow. From Moscow he wrote
to me twice, and it seemed to me, from his letters, as though he were regaining his sensibilities.
But picture to yourself my surprise, my dear sir! Suddenly, in the very middle of the winter,
just before the Christmas holidays, he presents himself before me!

"How didst thou get here? How is this? What's the matter? I know that thou hast no vacation
at this time.--Dost thou come from Moscow?"--I ask.

"Yes."

"And how about ... the university?"

"I have left the university."

"Thou hast left it?"

"Just so."

"For good?"

"For good."

"But art thou ill, pray, Yákoff?"

"No, father," says he, "I am not ill; but just don't bother me and question me, dear father,
or I will go away from here--and that's the last thou wilt ever see of me."

Yákoff tells me that he is not ill, but his face is such that I am fairly frightened. It was
dreadful, dark--not human, actually!--His cheeks were drawn, his cheek-bones projected, he
was mere skin and bone; his voice sounded as though it proceeded from a barrel ... while his
eyes.... O Lord and Master! what eyes!--menacing, wild, incessantly darting from side to side,
and it was impossible to catch them; his brows were knit, his lips seemed to be twisted on
one side.... What had happened to my Joseph Most Fair,[23] to my quiet lad? I cannot comprehend
it. "Can he have gone crazy?" I say to myself. He roams about like a spectre by night, he does
not sleep,--and then, all of a sudden, he will take to staring into a corner as though he were
completely benumbed.... It was enough to scare one!

Although he had threatened to leave the house if I did not leave him in peace, yet surely I
was his father! My last hope was ruined--yet I was to hold my tongue! So one day, availing
myself of an opportunity, I began to entreat Yákoff with tears, I began to adjure him by the
memory of his dead mother:

"Tell me," I said, "as thy father in the flesh and in the spirit, Yásha, what aileth thee?
Do not kill me; explain thyself, lighten thy heart! Can it be that thou hast ruined some Christian
soul? If so, repent!"

"Well, dear father," he suddenly says to me (this took place toward nightfall), "thou hast
moved me to compassion. I will tell thee the whole truth. I have not ruined any Christian soul--but
my own soul is going to perdition."

"How is that?"

"In this way...." And thereupon Yákoff raised his eyes to mine for the first time.--"It is
going on four months now," he began.... But suddenly he broke off and began to breathe heavily.

"What about the fourth month? Tell me, do not make me suffer!"

"This is the fourth month that I have been seeing him."

"Him? Who is he?"

"Why, the person ... whom it is awkward to mention at night."

I fairly turned cold all over and fell to quaking.

"What?!" I said, "dost thou see him?"

"Yes."

"And dost thou see him now?"

"Yes."

"Where?" And I did not dare to turn round, and we both spoke in a whisper.

"Why, yonder ..." and he indicated the spot with his eyes ... "yonder, in the corner."

I summoned up my courage and looked at the corner; there was nothing there.

"Why, good gracious, there is nothing there, Yákoff!"

"Thou dost not see him, but I do."

Again I glanced round ... again nothing. Suddenly there recurred to my mind the little old
man in the forest who had given him the chestnut. "What does he look like?" I said.... "Is
he green?"

"No, he is not green, but black."

"Has he horns?"

"No, he is like a man,--only all black."

As Yákoff speaks he displays his teeth in a grin and turns as pale as a corpse, and huddles
up to me in terror; and his eyes seem on the point of popping out of his head, and he keeps
staring at the corner.

"Why, it is a shadow glimmering faintly," I say. "That is the blackness from a shadow, but
thou mistakest it for a man."

"Nothing of the sort!--And I see his eyes: now he is rolling up the whites, now he is raising
his hand, he is calling me."

"Yákoff, Yákoff, thou shouldst try to pray; this obsession would disperse. Let God arise and
His enemies shall be scattered!"

"I have tried," says he, "but it has no effect."

"Wait, wait, Yákoff, do not lose thy courage. I will fumigate with incense; I will recite a
prayer; I will sprinkle holy water around thee."

Yákoff merely waved his hand. "I believe neither in thy incense nor in holy water; they don't
help worth a farthing. I cannot get rid of him now. Ever since he came to me last summer, on
one accursed day, he has been my constant visitor, and he cannot be driven away, Understand
this, father, and do not wonder any longer at my behaviour--and do not torment me."

"On what day did he come to thee?" I ask him, and all the while I am making the sign of the
cross over him. "Was it not when thou didst write about thy doubts?"

Yákoff put away my hand.

"Let me alone, dear father," says he, "don't excite me to wrath lest worse should come of it.
I'm not far from laying hands on myself, as it is."

You can imagine, my dear sir, how I felt when I heard that.... I remember that I wept all night.
"How have I deserved such wrath from the Lord?" I thought to myself.

At this point Father Alexyéi drew from his pocket a checked handkerchief and began to blow
his nose, and stealthily wiped his eyes, by the way.

A bad time began for us then [he went on]. I could think of but one thing: how to prevent him
from running away, or--which the Lord forbid!--of actually doing himself some harm! I watched
his every step, and was afraid to enter into conversation.--And there dwelt near us at that
time a neighbour, the widow of a colonel, Márfa Sávishna was her name; I cherished a great
respect for her, because she was a quiet, sensible woman, in spite of the fact that she was
young and comely. I was in the habit of going to her house frequently, and she did not despise
my vocation.[24] Not knowing, in my grief and anguish, what to do, I just told her all about
it.--At first she was greatly alarmed, and even thoroughly frightened; but later on she became
thoughtful. For a long time she deigned to sit thus, in silence; and then she expressed a wish
to see my son and converse with him. And I felt that I ought without fail to comply with her
wish; for it was not feminine curiosity which prompted it in this case, but something else.

On returning home I began to persuade Yákoff. "Come with me to see the colonel's widow," I
said to him.

He began to flourish his legs and arms!

"I won't go to her," says he, "not on any account! What shall I talk to her about?" He even
began to shout at me. But at last I conquered him, and hitching up my little sledge, I drove
him to Márfa Sávishna's, and, according to our compact, I left him alone with her. I was surprised
at his having consented so speedily. Well, never mind,--we shall see. Three or four hours later
my Yákoff returns.

"Well," I ask, "how did our little neighbour please thee?"

He made me no answer. I asked him again.

"She is a virtuous woman," I said.--"I suppose she was amiable with thee?"

"Yes," he says, "she is not like the others."

I saw that he seemed to have softened a little. And I made up my mind to question him then
and there....

"And how about the obsession?" I said.

Yákoff looked at me as though I had lashed him with a whip, and again made no reply. I did
not worry him further, and left the room; and an hour later I went to the door and peeped through
the keyhole.... And what do you think?--My Yásha was asleep! He was lying on the couch and
sleeping. I crossed myself several times in succession. "May the Lord send Márfa Sávishna every
blessing!" I said. "Evidently, she has managed to touch his embittered heart, the dear little
dove!"

The next day I see Yákoff take his cap.... I think to myself: "Shall I ask him whither he is
going?--But no, better not ask ... it certainly must be to her!"... And, in point of fact,
Yákoff did set off for Márfa Sávishna's house--and sat with her still longer than before; and
on the day following he did it again! Then again, the next day but one! My spirits began to
revive, for I saw that a change was coming over my son, and his face had grown quite different,
and it was becoming possible to look into his eyes: he did not turn away. He was just as depressed
as ever, but his former despair and terror had disappeared. But before I had recovered my cheerfulness
to any great extent everything again broke off short! Yákoff again became wild, and again it
was impossible to approach him. He sat locked up in his little room, and went no more to the
widow's.

"Can it be possible," I thought, "that he has hurt her feelings in some way, and she has forbidden
him the house?--But no," I thought ... "although he is unhappy he would not dare to do such
a thing; and besides, she is not that sort of woman."

At last I could endure it no longer, and I interrogated him: "Well, Yákoff, how about our neighbour?...
Apparently thou hast forgotten her altogether."

But he fairly roared at me:--"Our neighbour? Dost thou want him to jeer at me?"

"What?" I say.--Then he even clenched his fists and ... got perfectly furious.

"Yes!" he says; and formerly he had only towered up after a fashion, but now he began to laugh
and show his teeth.--"Away! Begone!"

To whom these words were addressed I know not! My legs would hardly bear me forth, to such
a degree was I frightened. Just imagine: his face was the colour of red copper, he was foaming
at the mouth, his voice was hoarse, exactly as though some one were choking him!... And that
very same day I went--I, the orphan of orphans--to Márfa Sávishna ... and found her in great
affliction. Even her outward appearance had undergone a change: she had grown thin in the face.
But she would not talk with me about my son. Only one thing she did say: that no human aid
could effect anything in that case. "Pray, father," she said,--and then she presented me with
one hundred rubles,--"for the poor and sick of your parish," she said. And again she repeated:
"Pray!"--O Lord! As if I had not prayed without that--prayed day and night!

Here Father Alexyéi again pulled out his handkerchief, and again wiped away his tears, but
not by stealth this time, and after resting for a little while, he resumed his cheerless narrative.

Yákoff and I then began to descend as a snowball rolls down hill, and both of us could see
that an abyss lay at the foot of the hill; but how were we to hold back, and what measures
could we take? And it was utterly impossible to conceal this; my entire parish was greatly
disturbed, and said: "The priest's son has gone mad; he is possessed of devils,--and the authorities
ought to be informed of all this."--And people infallibly would have informed the authorities
had not my parishioners taken pity on me ... for which I thank them. In the meantime winter
was drawing to an end, and spring was approaching.--And such a spring as God sent!--fair and
bright, such as even the old people could not remember: the sun shone all day long, there was
no wind, and the weather was warm! And then a happy thought occurred to me: to persuade Yákoff
to go off with me to do reverence to Mitrofány, in Vorónezh. "If that last remedy is of no
avail," I thought, "well, then, there is but one hope left--the grave!"

So I was sitting one day on the porch just before evening, and the sunset glow was flaming
in the sky, and the larks were warbling, and the apple-trees were in bloom, and the grass was
growing green.... I was sitting and meditating how I could communicate my intention to Yákoff.
Suddenly, lo and behold! he came out on the porch; he stood, gazed around, sighed, and sat
down on the step by my side. I was even frightened out of joy, but I did nothing except hold
my tongue. But he sits and looks at the sunset glow, and not a word does he utter either. But
it seemed to me as though he had become softened, the furrows on his brow had been smoothed
away, his eyes had even grown bright.... A little more, it seemed, and a tear would have burst
forth! On beholding such a change in him I--excuse me!--grew bold.

"Yákoff," I said to him, "do thou hearken to me without anger...." And then I informed him
of my intention; how we were both to go to Saint Mitrofány on foot; and it is about one hundred
and fifty versts to Vorónezh from our parts; and how pleasant it would be for us two, in the
spring chill, having risen before dawn, to walk and walk over the green grass, along the highway;
and how, if we made proper obeisance and prayed before the shrine of the holy man, perhaps--who
knows?--the Lord God would show mercy upon us, and he would receive healing, of which there
had already been many instances. And just imagine my happiness, my dear sir!

"Very well," says Yákoff, only he does not turn round, but keeps on gazing at the sky.--"I
consent. Let us go."

I was fairly stupefied....

"My friend," I say, "my dear little dove, my benefactor!"... But he asks me:

"When shall we set out?"

"Why, to-morrow, if thou wilt," I say.

So on the following day we started. We slung wallets over our shoulders, took staves in our
hands, and set forth. For seven whole days we trudged on, and all the while the weather favoured
us, and was even downright wonderful! There was neither sultry heat nor rain; the flies did
not bite, the dust did not make us itch. And every day my Yákoff acquired a better aspect.
I must tell you that Yákoff had not been in the habit of seeing that one in the open air, but
had felt him behind him, close to his back, or his shadow had seemed to be gliding alongside,
which troubled my son greatly. But on this occasion nothing of that sort happened, and nothing
made its appearance. We talked very little together ... but how greatly at our ease we felt--especially
I! I saw that my poor boy was coming to life again. I cannot describe to you, my dear sir,
what my feelings were then.--Well, we reached Vorónezh at last. We cleaned up ourselves and
washed ourselves, and went to the cathedral, to the holy man. For three whole days we hardly
left the temple. How many prayer-services we celebrated, how many candles we placed before
the holy pictures! And everything was going well, everything was fine; the days were devout,
the nights were tranquil; my Yákoff slept like an infant. He began to talk to me of his own
accord. He would ask: "Dost thou see nothing, father dear?" and smile. "No, I see nothing,"
I would answer.--What more could be demanded? My gratitude to the saint was unbounded.

Three days passed; I said to Yákoff: "Well, now, dear son, the matter has been set in order;
there's a festival in our street. One thing remains to be done; do thou make thy confession
and receive the communion; and then, with God's blessing, we will go our way, and after having
got duly rested, and worked a bit on the farm to increase thy strength, thou mayest bestir
thyself and find a place--and Márfa Sávishna will certainly help us in that," I said.

"No," said Yákoff, "why should we trouble her? But I will take her a ring from Mitrofány's hand."

Thereupon I was greatly encouraged. "See to it," I said, "that thou takest a silver ring, not
a gold one,--not a wedding-ring!"

My Yákoff flushed up and merely repeated that it was not proper to trouble her, but immediately
assented to all the rest.--We went to the cathedral on the following day; my Yákoff made his
confession, and prayed so fervently before it! And then he went forward to take the communion.
I was standing a little to one side, and did not feel the earth under me for joy.... It is
no sweeter for the angels in heaven! But as I look--what is the meaning of that?--My Yákoff
has received the communion, but does not go to sip the warm water and wine![25] He is standing
with his back to me.... I go to him.

"Yákoff," I say, "why art thou standing here?"

He suddenly wheels round. Will you believe it, I sprang back, so frightened was I!--His face
had been dreadful before, but now it had become ferocious, frightful! He was as pale as death,
his hair stood on end, his eyes squinted.... I even lost my voice with terror. I tried to speak
and could not; I was perfectly benumbed.... And he fairly rushed out of the church! I ran after
him ... but he fled straight to the tavern where we had put up, flung his wallet over his shoulder,
and away he flew!

"Whither?" I shouted to him. "Yákoff, what aileth thee? Stop, wait!"

But Yákoff never uttered a word in reply to me, but ran like a hare, and it was utterly impossible
to overtake him! He disappeared from sight. I immediately turned back, hired a cart, and trembled
all over, and all I could say was: "O Lord!" and, "O Lord!" And I understood nothing: some
calamity had descended upon us! I set out for home, for I thought, "He has certainly fled thither."--And
so he had. Six versts out of the town I espied him; he was striding along the highway. I overtook
him, jumped out of the cart, and rushed to him.

"Yásha! Yásha!"--He halted, turned his face toward me, but kept his eyes fixed on the ground
and compressed his lips. And say what I would to him, he stood there just like a statue, and
one could just see that he was breathing. And at last he trudged on again along the highway.--What
was there to do? I followed him....

Akh, what a journey that was, my dear sir! Great as had been our joy on the way to Vorónezh,
just so great was the horror of the return! I would try to speak to him, and he would begin
to gnash his teeth at me over his shoulder, precisely like a tiger or a hyena! Why I did not
go mad I do not understand to this day! And at last, one night, in a peasant's chicken-house,
he was sitting on the platform over the oven and dangling his feet and gazing about on all
sides, when I fell on my knees before him and began to weep, and besought him with bitter entreaty:

"Do not slay thy old father outright," I said; "do not let him fall into despair--tell me what
has happened to thee?"

He glanced at me as though he did not see who was before him, and suddenly began to speak,
but in such a voice that it rings in my ears even now.

"Listen, daddy," said he. "Dost thou wish to know the whole truth? When I had taken the communion,
thou wilt remember, and still held the particle[26] in my mouth, suddenly he (and that was
in the church, in the broad daylight!) stood in front of me, just as though he had sprung out
of the ground, and whispered to me ... (but he had never spoken to me before)--whispered: 'Spit
it out, and grind it to powder!' I did so; I spat it out, and ground it under foot. And now
it must be that I am lost forever, for every sin shall be forgiven, save the sin against the
Holy Spirit...."

And having uttered these dreadful words, my son threw himself back on the platform and I dropped
down on the floor of the hut.... My legs failed me....

Father Alexyéi paused for a moment, and covered his eyes with his hand.

But why should I weary you longer [he went on], and myself? My son and I dragged ourselves
home, and there he soon afterward expired, and I lost my Yásha. For several days before his
death he neither ate nor drank, but kept running back and forth in the room and repeating that
there could be no forgiveness for his sin.... But he never saw him again. "He has ruined my
soul," he said; "and why should he come any more now?" And when Yákoff took to his bed, he
immediately sank into unconsciousness, and thus, without repentance, like a senseless worm,
he went from this life to life eternal....

But I will not believe that the Lord judged harshly....

And among other reasons why I do not believe it is, that he looked so well in his coffin; he
seemed to have grown young again and resembled the Yákoff of days gone by. His face was so
tranquil and pure, his hair curled in little rings, and there was a smile on his lips. Márfa
Sávishna came to look at him, and said the same thing. She encircled him all round with flowers,
and laid flowers on his heart, and set up the gravestone at her own expense.

And I was left alone.... And that is why, my dear sir, you have beheld such great grief on
my face.... It will never pass off---and it cannot.

I wanted to speak a word of comfort to Father Alexyéi ... but could think of none. We parted
soon after.

OLD PORTRAITS[27]

(1881)

About forty versts from our village there dwelt, many years ago, the great-uncle of my mother,
a retired Sergeant of the Guards and a fairly wealthy landed proprietor, Alexyéi Sergyéitch
Telyégin, on his ancestral estate, Sukhodól. He never went anywhere himself, and therefore
did not visit us; but I was sent to pay my respects to him a couple of times a year, at first
with my governor, and later on alone. Alexyéi Sergyéitch always received me very cordially,
and I spent three or four days with him. He was already an old man when I made his acquaintance;
I remember that I was twelve years old at my first visit, and he was already over seventy.
He had been born under the Empress Elizabeth, in the last year of her reign. He lived alone
with his wife, Malánya Pávlovna; she was ten years younger than he. They had had two daughters
who had been married long before, and rarely visited Sukhodól; there had been quarrels between
them and their parents,[28] and Alexyéi Sergyéitch hardly ever mentioned them.

I see that ancient, truly noble steppe home as though it stood before me now. Of one story,
with a huge mezzanine,[29] erected at the beginning of the present century from wonderfully
thick pine beams--such beams were brought at that epoch from the Zhízdrin pine forests; there
is no trace of them nowadays!--it was very spacious and contained a multitude of rooms, which
were decidedly low-ceiled and dark, it is true, and the windows were mere slits in the walls,
for the sake of warmth. As was proper, the offices and the house-serfs' cottages surrounded
the manor-house on all sides, and a park adjoined it, small but with fine fruit-trees, pellucid
apples and seedless pears; for ten versts round about stretched out the flat, black-loam steppe.
There was no lofty object for the eye: neither a tree nor a belfry; only here and there a windmill
reared itself aloft with holes in its wings; it was a regular Sukhodól! (Dry Valley). Inside
the house the rooms were filled with ordinary, plain furniture; rather unusual was a verst-post
which stood on a window-sill in the hall, and bore the following inscription:

"If thou walkest 68 times around this hall,[30] thou wilt have gone a verst; if thou goest
87 times from the extreme corner of the drawing-room to the right corner of the billiard-room,
thou wilt have gone a verst,"--and so forth. But what most impressed the guest who arrived
for the first time was the great number of pictures hung on the walls, for the most part the
work of so-called Italian masters: ancient landscapes, and mythological and religious subjects.
But as all these pictures had turned very black, and had even become warped, all that met the
eye was patches of flesh-colour, or a billowy red drapery on an invisible body--or an arch
which seemed suspended in the air, or a dishevelled tree with blue foliage, or the bosom of
a nymph with a large nipple, like the cover of a soup-tureen; a sliced watermelon, with black
seeds; a turban, with a feather above a horse's head; or the gigantic, light-brown leg of some
apostle or other, with a muscular calf and up-turned toes, suddenly protruded itself. In the
drawing-room, in the place of honour, hung a portrait of the Empress Katherine II, full length,
a copy from Lampi's well-known portrait--the object of special reverence, one may say adoration,
for the master of the house. From the ceiling depended crystal chandeliers in bronze fittings,
very small and very dusty.

Alexyéi Sergyéitch himself was a very squat, pot-bellied, little old man, with a plump, but
agreeable face all of one colour, with sunken lips and very vivacious little eyes beneath lofty
eyebrows. He brushed his scanty hair over the back of his head; it was only since the year
1812 that he had discarded powder. Alexyéi Sergyéitch always wore a grey "redingote" with three
capes which fell over his shoulders, a striped waistcoat, chamois-leather breeches and dark-red
morocco short boots with a heart-shaped cleft, and a tassel at the top of the leg; he wore
a white muslin neckerchief, a frill, lace cuffs, and two golden English "onions,"[31] one in
each pocket of his waistcoat. In his right hand he generally held an enamelled snuff-box with
"Spanish" snuff, while his left rested on a cane with a silver handle which had been worn quite
smooth with long use. Alexyéi Sergyéitch had a shrill, nasal voice, and was incessantly smiling,
amiably, but somewhat patronisingly, not without a certain self-satisfied pompousness. He also
laughed in an amiable manner, with a fine, thin laugh like a string of wax pearls. He was courteous
and affable, in the ancient manner of Katherine's day, and moved his hands slowly and with
a circular motion, also in ancient style. On account of his weak legs he could not walk, but
he was wont to trip with hurried little steps from one arm-chair to another arm-chair, in which
he suddenly seated himself--or, rather, he fell into it, as softly as though he had been a pillow.

As I have already said, Alexyéi Sergyéitch never went anywhere, and associated very little
with the neighbours, although he was fond of society,--for he was loquacious! He had plenty
of society in his own house, it is true: divers Nikanór Nikanóritches, Sevastyéi Sevastyéitches,
Fedúlitches, and Mikhéitches, all poverty-stricken petty nobles, in threadbare kazák coats
and short jackets, frequently from his own noble shoulders, dwelt beneath his roof, not to
mention the poor gentlewomen in cotton-print gowns, with black kerchiefs on their shoulders,
and worsted reticules in their tightly-clenched fingers,--divers Avdótiya Sávishnas, Pelagéya
Mirónovnas, and plain Feklúskas and Arínkas, who received asylum in the women's wing. No less
than fifteen persons ever sat down to Alexyéi Sergyéitch's table ... he was so hospitable!--Among
all these parasites two individuals stood forth with special prominence: a dwarf named Janus
or the Two-faced, a Dane,--or, as some asserted, of Jewish extraction,--and crazy Prince L.
In contrast to the customs of that day the dwarf did not in the least serve as a butt for the
guests, and was not a jester; on the contrary, he maintained constant silence, wore an irate
and surly mien, contracted his brows in a frown, and gnashed his teeth as soon as any one addressed
a question to him. Alexyéi Sergyéitch also called him a philosopher, and even respected him.
At table he was always the first to be served after the guests and the master and mistress
of the house.--"God has wronged him," Alexyéi Sergyéitch was wont to say: "that was the Lord's
will; but it is not my place to wrong him."

"Why is he a philosopher?" I asked one day. (Janus did not like me. No sooner would I approach
him, than he would begin to snarl and growl hoarsely, "Stranger! don't bother me!")

"But God have mercy, why isn't he a philosopher?" replied Alexyéi Sergyéitch. "Just observe,
my little gentleman, how finely he holds his tongue!"

"But why is he two-faced?"

"Because, my young sir, he has one face outside; there it is for you, ninny, and judge it....
But the other, the real one, he hides. And I am the only one who knows that face, and for that
I love him.... Because 't is a good face. Thou, for example, gazest and beholdest nothing ...
but even without words, I see when he is condemning me for anything; for he is strict! And
always with reason. Which thing thou canst not understand, young sir; but just believe me,
an old man!"

The true history of the two-faced Janus--whence he had come, how he had got into Alexyéi Sergyéitch's
house--no one knew. On the other hand, the story of Prince L. was well known to all. As a young
man of twenty, he had come from a wealthy and distinguished family to Petersburg, to serve
in a regiment of the Guards; the Empress Katherine noticed him at the first Court reception,
and halting in front of him and pointing to him with her fan, she said, in a loud voice, addressing
one of her favourites: "Look, Adám Vasílievitch, see what a beauty! A regular doll!" The blood
flew to the poor young fellow's head. On reaching home he ordered his calash to be harnessed
up, and donning his ribbon of the Order of Saint Anna, he started out to drive all over the
town, as though he had actually fallen into luck.--"Crush every one who does not get out of
the way!" he shouted to his coachman.--All this was immediately brought to the Empress's knowledge;
an order was issued that he was to be adjudged insane and given in charge of his two brothers;
and the latter, without the least delay, carried him off to the country and chained him up
in a stone bag.--As they were desirous to make use of his property, they did not release the
unfortunate man even when he recovered his senses and came to himself, but continued to keep
him incarcerated until he really did lose his mind.--But their wickedness profited them nothing.
Prince L. outlived his brothers, and after long sufferings, found himself under the guardianship
of Alexyéi Sergyéitch, who was a connection of his. He was a fat, perfectly bald man, with
a long, thin nose and blue goggle-eyes. He had got entirely out of the way of speaking--he
merely mumbled something unintelligible; but he sang the ancient Russian ballads admirably,
having retained, to extreme old age, his silvery freshness of voice, and in his singing he
enunciated every word clearly and distinctly. Something in the nature of fury came over him
at times, and then he became terrifying. He would stand in one corner, with his face to the
wall, and all perspiring and crimson,--crimson all over his bald head to the nape of his neck.
Emitting a malicious laugh, and stamping his feet, he would issue orders that some one was
to be castigated,--probably his brothers.--"Thrash!"-- he yelled hoarsely, choking and coughing
with laughter,--"scourge, spare not, thrash, thrash, thrash the monsters my malefactors! That's
right! That's right!" Just before he died he greatly amazed and frightened Alexyéi Sergyéitch.
He entered the latter's room all pale and quiet, and inclining his body in obeisance to the
girdle, he first returned thanks for the asylum and oversight, and then requested that a priest
might be sent for; for Death had come to him--he had beheld her--and he must pardon all men
and whiten himself.

"How was it that thou didst see her?" muttered the astounded Alexyéi Sergyéitch, who now heard
a coherent speech from him for the first time.--"What is she like? Has she a scythe?"

"No," replied Prince L.--"She's a plain old woman in a loose gown--only she has but one eye
in her forehead, and that eye has no lid."

And on the following day Prince L. actually expired, after having fulfilled all his religious
obligations and taken leave of every one intelligently and with emotion.

"That's the way I shall die also," Alexyéi Sergyéitch was wont to remark. And, in fact, something
similar happened with him--of which, later on.

But now let us return to our former subject. Alexyéi Sergyéitch did not consort with the neighbours,
as I have already said; and they did not like him any too well, calling him eccentric, arrogant,
a mocker, and even a Martinist who did not recognise the authorities, without themselves understanding,
of course, the meaning of the last word. To a certain extent the neighbours were right. Alexyéi
Sergyéitch had resided for nearly seventy years in succession in his Sukhodól, having almost
no dealings whatever with the superior authorities, with the military officials, or the courts.
"The court is for the bandit, the military officer for the soldier," he was wont to say; "but
I, God be thanked, am neither a bandit nor a soldier." Alexyéi Sergyéitch really was somewhat
eccentric, but the soul within him was not of the petty sort. I will narrate a few things about
him.

I never found out authoritatively what were his political views, if, indeed, one can apply
to him such a very new-fangled expression; but he was, in his way, rather an aristocrat than
a nobly-born master of serfs. More than once he complained because God had not given him a
son and heir "for the honour of the race, for the continuation of the family." On the wall
of his study hung the genealogical tree of the Telyégins, with very profuse branches, and multitudinous
circles in the shape of apples, enclosed in a gilt frame.

"We Telyégins,"[32] he said, "are a very ancient stock, existing from remote antiquity; there
have been a great many of us Telyégins, but we have not run after foreigners, we have not bowed
our backs, we have not wearied ourselves by standing on the porches of the mighty, we have
not nourished ourselves on the courts, we have not earned wages, we have not pined for Moscow,
we have not intrigued in Peter;[33] we have sat still, each on his place, his own master on
his own land ... thrifty, domesticated birds, my dear sir!--Although I myself have served in
the Guards, yet it was not for long, I thank you!"

Alexyéi Sergyéitch preferred the olden days.--"Things were freer then, more seemly, I assure
you on my honour! But ever since the year one thousand and eight hundred" (why precisely from
that year he did not explain), "this warring and this soldiering have come into fashion, my
dear fellow. These military gentlemen have mounted upon their heads some sort of plumes made
of cocks' tails, and made themselves like cocks; they have drawn their necks up tightly, very
tightly ... they speak in hoarse tones, their eyes are popping out of their heads--and how
can they help being hoarse? The other day some police corporal or other came to see me.--'I
have come to you, Your Well-Born,' quoth he.... (A pretty way he had chosen to surprise me!
... for I know myself that I am well-born....) 'I have a matter of business with you.' But
I said to him: 'Respected sir, first undo the hooks on thy collar. Otherwise, which God forbid,
thou wilt sneeze! Akh, what will become of thee! What will become of thee!--Thou wilt burst
like a puff-ball.... And I shall be responsible for it!' And how they drink, those military
gentlemen--o-ho-ho! I generally give orders that they shall be served with champagne from the
Don, because Don champagne and Pontacq are all the same to them; it slips down their throats
so smoothly and so fast--how are they to distinguish the difference? And here's another thing:
they have begun to suck that sucking-bottle, to smoke tobacco. A military man will stick that
same sucking-bottle under his moustache, between his lips, and emit smoke through his nostrils,
his mouth, and even his ears--and think himself a hero! There are my horrid sons-in-law, for
example; although one of them is a senator, and the other is some sort of a curator, they suck
at the sucking-bottle also,--and yet they regard themselves as clever men!..."

Alexyéi Sergyéitch could not endure smoking tobacco, nor dogs, especially small dogs.--"Come,
if thou art a Frenchman, then keep a lap-dog. Thou runnest, thou skippest hither and thither,
and it follows thee, with its tail in the air ... but of what use is it to fellows like me?"--He
was very neat and exacting. He never spoke of the Empress Katherine otherwise than with enthusiasm,
and in a lofty, somewhat bookish style: "She was a demi-god, not a human being!--Only contemplate
yon smile, my good sir," he was wont to add, pointing at the Lampi portrait, "and admit that
she was a demi-god! I, in my lifetime, have been so happy as to have been vouchsafed the bliss
of beholding yon smile, and to all eternity it will never be erased from my heart!"--And thereupon
he would impart anecdotes from the life of Katherine such as it has never been my lot to read
or hear anywhere. Here is one of them. Alexyéi Sergyéitch did not permit the slightest hint
at the failings of the great Empress. "Yes, and in conclusion," he cried: "is it possible to
judge her as one judges other people?--One day, as she was sitting in her powder-mantle, at
the time of her morning toilet, she gave orders that her hair should be combed out.... And
what happened? The waiting-woman passes the comb through it, and electric sparks fly from it
in a perfect shower!--Then she called to her the body physician, Rodgerson, who was present
on duty, and says to him: 'I know that people condemn me for certain actions; but dost thou
see this electricity? Consequently, with such a nature and constitution as mine, thou mayest
thyself judge, for thou art a physician, that it is unjust to condemn me, but they should understand
me!'"

The following incident was ineffaceably retained in the memory of Alexyéi Sergyéitch. He was
standing one day on the inner watch in the palace, and he was only sixteen years of age. And
lo, the Empress passes him--he presents arms.... "And she," cried Alexyéi Sergyéitch, again
with rapture, "smiling at my youth and my zeal, deigned to give me her hand to kiss, and patted
me on the cheek, and inquired who I was, and whence I came, and from what family? And then
..." (here the old man's voice generally broke) ... "then she bade me give my mother her compliments
and thank her for rearing her children so well. And whether I was in heaven or on earth, and
how and whither she withdrew,--whether she soared up on high, or passed into another room,--I
know not to this day!"

I often tried to question Alexyéi Sergyéitch about those olden days, about the men who surrounded
the Empress.... But he generally evaded the subject. "What's the use of talking about old times?"--he
said ... "one only tortures himself. One says to himself,--'Thou wert a young man then, but
now thy last teeth have vanished from thy mouth.' And there's no denying it--the old times
were good ... well, and God be with them! And as for those men--I suppose, thou fidgety child,
that thou art talking about the accidental men? Thou hast seen a bubble spring forth on water?
So long as it is whole and lasts, what beautiful colours play upon it! Red and yellow and blue;
all one can say is, ''Tis a rainbow or a diamond!'--But it soon bursts, and no trace of it
remains. And that's what those men were like."

"Well, and how about Potyómkin?" I asked one day.

Alexyéi Sergyéitch assumed a pompous mien. "Potyómkin, Grigóry Alexándritch, was a statesman,
a theologian, a nursling of Katherine's, her offspring, one must say.... But enough of that,
my little sir!"

Alexyéi Sergyéitch was a very devout man and went to church regularly, although it was beyond
his strength. There was no superstition perceptible in him; he ridiculed signs, the evil eye,
and other "twaddle," yet he did not like it when a hare ran across his path, and it was not
quite agreeable for him to meet a priest.[34] He was very respectful to ecclesiastical persons,
nevertheless, and asked their blessing, and even kissed their hand every time, but he talked
with them reluctantly.--"They emit a very strong odour," he explained; "but I, sinful man that
I am, have grown effeminate beyond measure;--their hair is so long[35] and oily, and they comb
it out in all directions, thinking thereby to show me respect, and they clear their throats
loudly in the middle of conversation, either out of timidity or because they wish to please
me in that way also. Well, but they remind me of my hour of death. But be that as it may, I
want to live a while longer. Only, little sir, don't repeat these remarks of mine; respect
the ecclesiastical profession--only fools do not respect it; and I am to blame for talking
nonsense in my old age."

Alexyéi Sergyéitch had received a scanty education,[36] like all nobles of that epoch; but
he had completed it, to a certain degree, by reading. He read only Russian books of the end
of the last century; he considered the newer writers unleavened and weak in style. During his
reading he placed beside him, on a round, one-legged little table, a silver jug filled with
a special effervescent kvas flavoured with mint, whose pleasant odour disseminated itself through
all the rooms. He placed large, round spectacles on the tip of his nose; but in his later years
he did not so much read as stare thoughtfully over the rims of the spectacles, elevating his
brows, mowing with his lips and sighing. Once I caught him weeping, with a book on his knees,
which greatly surprised me, I admit.

He recalled the following wretched doggerel:

    O all-conquering race of man!
    Rest is unknown to thee!
    Thou findest it only
    When thou swallowest the dust of the grave....
    Bitter, bitter is this rest!
    Sleep, ye dead.... But weep, ye living!

These verses were composed by a certain Górmitch-Gormítzky, a roving poetaster, whom Alexyéi
Sergyéitch had harboured in his house because he seemed to him a delicate and even subtle man;
he wore shoes with knots of ribbon, pronounced his o's broadly, and, raising his eyes to heaven,
he sighed frequently. In addition to all these merits, Górmitch-Gormítzky spoke French passably
well, for he had been educated in a Jesuit college, while Alexyéi Sergyéitch only "understood"
it. But having once drunk himself dead-drunk in a dram-shop, this same subtle Gormítzky displayed
outrageous violence. He thrashed "to flinders" Alexyéi Sergyéitch's valet, the cook, two laundresses
who happened along, and even an independent carpenter, and smashed several panes in the windows,
yelling lustily the while: "Here now, I'll just show these Russian sluggards, these unlicked
katzápy!"[37]--And what strength that puny little man displayed! Eight men could hardly control
him! For this turbulence Alexyéi Sergyéitch gave orders that the rhymster should be flung out
of the house, after he had preliminarily been rolled in the snow (it happened in the winter),
to sober him.

"Yes," Alexyéi Sergyéitch was wont to say, "my day is over; the horse is worn out. I used to
keep poets at my expense, and I used to buy pictures and books from the Jews--and my geese
were quite as good as those of Mukhán, and I had genuine slate-coloured tumbler-pigeons....
I was an amateur of all sorts of things! Except that I never was a dog-fancier, because of
the drunkenness and the clownishness! I was mettlesome, untamable! God forbid that a Telyégin
should be anything but first-class in everything! And I had a splendid horse-breeding establishment....
And those horses came ... whence, thinkest thou, my little sir?--From those very renowned studs
of the Tzar Iván Alexyéitch, the brother of Peter the Great.... I'm telling you the truth!
All stallions, dark brown in colour, with manes to their knees, tails to their hoofs.... Lions!
Vanity of vanities, all is vanity! But what's the use of regretting it? Every man has his limit
fixed for him.--You cannot fly higher than heaven, nor live in the water, nor escape from the
earth.... Let us live on a while longer, at any rate!"

And again the old man smiled and took a pinch of his Spanish tobacco.

His peasants loved him. Their master was kind, according to them, and not a heart-breaker.--Only,
they also repeated that he was a worn-out steed. Formerly Alexyéi Sergyéitch had gone into
everything himself: he had ridden out into the fields, and to the flour-mill, and to the oil-mill
and the storehouses, and looked in to the peasants' cottages; every one was familiar with his
racing-drozhky,[38] upholstered in crimson plush and drawn by a well-grown horse with a broad
blaze extending clear across its forehead, named "Lantern"--from that same famous breeding
establishment. Alexyéi Sergyéitch drove him himself with the ends of the reins wound round
his fists. But when his seventieth birthday came the old man gave up everything, and entrusted
the management of his estate to the peasant bailiff Antíp, of whom he secretly stood in awe
and called Micromegas (memories of Voltaire!), or simply "robber."

"Well, robber, hast thou gathered a big lot of stolen goods?" he would say, looking the robber
straight in the eye.

"Everything is according to your grace," Antíp would reply merrily.

"Grace is all right, only just look out for thyself, Micromegas! Don't dare to touch my peasants,
my subjects behind my back! They will make complaint ... my cane is not far off, seest thou?"

"I always keep your little cane well in mind, dear little father Alexyéi Sergyéitch," replied
Antíp-Micromegas, stroking his beard.

"That's right, keep it in mind!" and master and bailiff laughed in each other's faces.

With his house-serfs, with his serfs in general, with his "subjects" (Alexyéi Sergyéitch loved
that word), he dealt gently.--"Because, judge for thyself, little nephew, if thou hast nothing
of thine own save the cross on thy neck,[39] and that a brass one, don't hanker after other
folks' things.... What sense is there in that?" There is no denying the fact that no one even
thought of the so-called problem of the serfs at that epoch; and it could not disturb Alexyéi
Sergyéitch. He very calmly ruled his "subjects"; but he condemned bad landed proprietors and
called them the enemies of their class.

He divided the nobles in general into three categories: the judicious, "of whom there are not
many"; the profligate, "of whom there is a goodly number"; and the licentious, "of whom there
are enough to dam a pond." And if any one of them was harsh and oppressive to his subjects,
that man was guilty in the sight of God, and culpable in the sight of men!--Yes; the house-serfs
led an easy life in the old man's house; the "subjects behind his back" were less well off,
as a matter of course, despite the cane wherewith he threatened Micromegas.--And how many there
were of them--of those house-serfs--in his manor! And for the most part they were old, sinewy,
hairy, grumbling, stoop-shouldered, clad in long-skirted nankeen kaftans, and imbued with a
strong acrid odour! And in the women's department nothing was to be heard but the trampling
of bare feet, and the rustling of petticoats.--The head valet was named Irinárkh, and Alexyéi
Sergyéitch always summoned him with a long-drawn-out call: "I-ri-na-a-árkh!"--He called the
others: "Young fellow! Boy! What subject is there?!"--He could not endure bells. "God have
mercy, this is no tavern!" And what amazed me was, that no matter at what time Alexyéi Sergyéitch
called his valet, the man instantly presented himself, just as though he had sprung out of
the earth, and placing his heels together, and putting his hands behind his back, stood before
his master a grim and, as it were, an irate but zealous servant!

Alexyéi Sergyéitch was lavish beyond his means; but he did not like to be called "benefactor."--"What
sort of a benefactor am I to you, sir?... I'm doing myself a favour, not you, my good sir!"
(When he was angry or indignant he always called people "you.")--"To a beggar give once, give
twice, give thrice," he was wont to say.... "Well, and if he returns for the fourth time--give
to him yet again, only add therewith: 'My good man, thou shouldst work with something else
besides thy mouth all the time.'"

"Uncle," I used to ask him, "what if the beggar should return for the fifth time after that?"

"Why, then, do thou give to him for the fifth time."

The sick people who appealed to him for aid he had cured at his own expense, although he himself
did not believe in doctors, and never sent for them.--"My deceased mother," he asserted, "used
to heal all maladies with olive-oil and salt; she both administered it internally and rubbed
it on externally, and everything passed off splendidly. And who was my mother? She had her
birth under Peter the First--only think of that!"

Alexyéi Sergyéitch was a Russian man in every respect; he loved Russian viands, he loved Russian
songs, but the accordion, "a factory invention," he detested; he loved to watch the maidens
in their choral songs, the women in their dances. In his youth, it was said, he had sung rollickingly
and danced with agility. He loved to steam himself in the bath,--and steamed himself so energetically
that Irinárkh, who served him as bath-attendant, thrashed him with a birch-besom soaked in
beer, rubbed him down with shredded linden bark,[40] then with a bit of woollen cloth, rolled
a soap bladder over his master's shoulders,--this faithfully-devoted Irinárkh was accustomed
to say every time, as he climbed down from the shelf as red as "a new brass statue": "Well,
for this time I, the servant of God, Irinárkh Tolobyéeff, am still whole.... What will happen
next time?"

And Alexyéi Sergyéitch spoke splendid Russian, somewhat old-fashioned, but piquant and pure
as spring water, constantly interspersing his speech with his pet words: "honour bright," "God
have mercy," "at any rate," "sir," and "little sir."...

Enough concerning him, however. Let us talk about Alexyéi Sergyéitch's spouse, Malánya Pávlovna.

Malánya Pávlovna was a native of Moscow, and had been accounted the greatest beauty in town,
la Vénus de Moscou.--When I knew her she was already a gaunt old woman, with delicate but insignificant
features, little curved hare-like teeth in a tiny little mouth, with a multitude of tight little
curls on her forehead, and dyed eyebrows. She constantly wore a pyramidal cap with rose-coloured
ribbons, a high ruff around her neck, a short white gown and prunella shoes with red heels;
and over her gown she wore a jacket of blue satin, with the sleeve depending from the right
shoulder. She had worn precisely such a toilet on St. Peter's day, 1789! On that day, being
still a maiden, she had gone with her relatives to the Khodýnskoe Field,[41] to see the famous
prize-fight arranged by the Orlóffs.

"And Count Alexyéi Grigórievitch ..." (oh, how many times did I hear that tale!), ... "having
descried me, approached, made a low obeisance, holding his hat in both hands, and spake thus:
'My stunning beauty, why dost thou allow that sleeve to hang from thy shoulder? Is it that
thou wishest to have a match at fisticuffs with me?... With pleasure; only I tell thee beforehand
that thou hast vanquished me--I surrender!--and I am thy captive!'--and every one stared at
us and marvelled."

And so she had worn that style of toilet ever since.

"Only, I wore no cap then, but a hat à la bergère de Trianon; and although I was powdered,
yet my hair gleamed through it like gold!"

Malánya Pávlovna was stupid to sanctity, as the saying goes; she chattered at random, and did
not herself quite know what issued from her mouth--but it was chiefly about Orlóff.--Orlóff
had become, one may say, the principal interest of her life. She usually entered--no! she floated
into--the room, moving her head in a measured way like a peacock, came to a halt in the middle
of it, with one foot turned out in a strange sort of way, and holding the pendent sleeve in
two fingers (that must have been the pose which had pleased Orlóff once on a time), she looked
about her with arrogant carelessness, as befits a beauty,-- she even sniffed and whispered
"The idea!" exactly as though some important cavalier-adorer were besieging her with compliments,--then
suddenly walked on, clattering her heels and shrugging her shoulders.-- She also took Spanish
snuff out of a tiny bonbon box, scooping it out with a tiny golden spoon, and from time to
time, especially when a new person made his appearance, she raised--not to her eyes, but to
her nose (her vision was excellent)--a double lorgnette in the shape of a pair of horns, showing
off and twisting about her little white hand with one finger standing out apart.

How many times did Malánya Pávlovna describe to me her wedding in the Church of the Ascension,
"which is on the Arbát Square--such a fine church!--and all Moscow was present at it ... there
was such a crush! 'T was frightful! There were equipages drawn by six horses, golden carriages,
runners ... one of Count Zavadóvsky's runners even fell under the wheels! And the bishop himself
married us,[42] and what an address he delivered! Everybody wept--wherever I looked there was
nothing but tears, tears ... and the Governor-General's horses were tiger-coloured.... And
how many, many flowers people brought!... They overwhelmed us with flowers! And one foreigner,
a rich, very rich man, shot himself for love on that occasion, and Orlóff was present also....
And approaching Alexyéi Sergyéitch he congratulated him and called him a lucky dog.... 'Thou
art a lucky dog, brother gaper!' he said. And in reply Alexyéi Sergyéitch made such a wonderful
obeisance, and swept the plume of his hat along the floor from left to right ... as much as
to say: 'There is a line drawn now, Your Radiance, between you and my spouse which you must
not step across!'--And Orlóff, Alexyéi Grigórievitch, immediately understood and lauded him.--Oh,
what a man he was! What a man! And then, on another occasion, Alexis and I were at a ball in
his house--I was already married--and what magnificent diamond buttons he wore! And I could
not restrain myself, but praised them. 'What splendid diamonds you have, Count!' And thereupon
he took a knife from the table, cut off one button and presented it to me--saying: 'You have
in your eyes, my dear little dove, diamonds a hundredfold finer; just stand before the mirror
and compare them.' And I did stand there, and he stood beside me.--'Well? Who is right?'--says
he--and keeps rolling his eyes all round me. And then Alexyéi Sergyéitch was greatly dismayed;
but I said to him: 'Alexis,' I said to him, 'please do not be dismayed; thou shouldst know
me better!' And he answered me: 'Be at ease, Mélanie!'--And those same diamonds I now have
encircling a medallion of Alexyéi Grigórievitch--I think, my dear, that thou hast seen me wear
it on my shoulder on festival days, on a ribbon of St. George--because he was a very brave
hero, a cavalier of the Order of St. George: he burned the Turks!"[43]

Notwithstanding all this, Malánya Pávlovna was a very kind woman; she was easy to please.--"She
doesn't nag you, and she doesn't sneer at you," the maids said of her.--Malánya Pávlovna was
passionately fond of all sweets, and a special old woman, who occupied herself with nothing
but the preserves, and therefore was called the preserve-woman, brought to her, half a score
of times in a day, a Chinese plate now with candied rose-leaves, again with barberries in honey,
or orange sherbet. Malánya Pávlovna feared solitude--dreadful thoughts come then--and was almost
constantly surrounded by female hangers-on whom she urgently entreated: "Talk, talk! Why do
you sit there and do nothing but warm your seats?"--and they began to twitter like canary-birds.
Being no less devout than Alexyéi Sergyéitch, she was very fond of praying; but as, according
to her own words, she had not learned to recite prayers well, she kept for that purpose the
widow of a deacon, who prayed so tastily! She would never stumble to all eternity! And, in
fact, that deacon's widow understood how to utter prayerful words in an irrepressible sort
of way, without a break even when she inhaled or exhaled her breath--and Malánya Pávlovna listened
and melted with emotion. She had another widow also attached to her service; the latter's duty
consisted in telling her stories at night,--"but only old ones," entreated Malánya Pávlovna,
"those I already know; all the new ones are spurious."

Malánya Pávlovna was very frivolous and sometimes suspicious. All of a sudden she would take
some idea into her head. She did not like the dwarf Janus, for example; it always seemed to
her as though he would suddenly start in and begin to shriek: "But do you know who I am? A
Buryát Prince! So, then, submit!"--And if she did not, he would set fire to the house out of
melancholy. Malánya Pávlovna was as lavish as Alexyéi Sergyéitch; but she never gave money--she
did not wish to soil her pretty little hands--but kerchiefs, ear-rings, gowns, ribbons, or
she would send a patty from the table, or a bit of the roast, or if not that, a glass of wine.
She was also fond of regaling the peasant-women on holidays. They would begin to dance, and
she would click her heels and strike an attitude.

Alexyéi Sergyéitch was very well aware that his wife was stupid; but he had trained himself,
almost from the first year of his married life, to pretend that she was very keen of tongue
and fond of saying stinging things. As soon as she got to chattering he would immediately shake
his little finger at her and say: "Okh, what a naughty little tongue! What a naughty little
tongue! Won't it catch it in the next world! It will be pierced with red-hot needles!"--But
Malánya Pávlovna did not take offence at this; on the contrary, she seemed to feel flattered
at hearing such remarks--as much as to say: "Well, I can't help it! It isn't my fault that
I was born witty!"

Malánya Pávlovna worshipped her husband, and all her life remained an exemplary and faithful
wife. But there had been an "object" in her life also, a young nephew, a hussar, who had been
slain, so she assumed, in a duel on her account---but, according to more trustworthy information,
he had died from a blow received on the head from a billiard-cue, in tavern company. The water-colour
portrait of this "object" was preserved by her in a secret casket. Malánya Pávlovna crimsoned
to the very ears every time she alluded to Kapítonushka--that was the "object's" name;--while
Alexyéi Sergyéitch scowled intentionally, again menaced his wife with his little finger and
said, "Trust not a horse in the meadow, a wife in the house! Okh, that Kapítonushka, Kupidónushka!"--Then
Malánya Pávlovna bristled up all over and exclaimed:

"Alexis, shame on you, Alexis!--You yourself probably flirted with divers little ladies in
your youth--and so you take it for granted...."

"Come, that will do, that will do, Malániushka," Alexyéi Sergyéitch interrupted her, with a
smile;--"thy gown is white, and thy soul is whiter still!"

"It is whiter, Alexis; it is whiter!"

"Okh, what a naughty little tongue, on my honour, what a naughty little tongue!" repeated Alexyéi
Sergyéitch, tapping her on the cheek.

To mention Malánya Pávlovna's "convictions" would be still more out of place than to mention
those of Alexyéi Sergyéitch; but I once chanced to be the witness of a strange manifestation
of my aunt's hidden feelings. I once chanced, in the course of conversation, to mention the
well-known Sheshkóvsky.[44] Malánya Pávlovna suddenly became livid in the face,--as livid as
a corpse,--turned green, despite the layer of paint and powder, and in a dull, entirely-genuine
voice (which very rarely happened with her--as a general thing she seemed always somewhat affected,
assumed an artificial tone and lisped) said: "Okh! whom hast thou mentioned! And at nightfall,
into the bargain!--Don't utter that name!" I was amazed; what significance could that name
possess for such an inoffensive and innocent being, who would not have known how to devise,
much less to execute, anything reprehensible?--This alarm, which revealed itself after a lapse
of nearly half a century, induced in me reflections which were not altogether cheerful.

Alexyéi Sergyéitch died in his eighty-eighth year, in the year 1848, which evidently disturbed
even him. And his death was rather strange. That morning he had felt well, although he no longer
quitted his arm-chair at all. But suddenly he called to his wife: "Malániushka, come hither!"

"What dost thou want, Alexis?"

"It is time for me to die, that's what, my darling."

"God be with you, Alexyéi Sergyéitch! Why so?"

"This is why. In the first place, one must show moderation; and more than that; I was looking
at my legs a little while ago ... they were strange legs--and that settles it!--I looked at
my hands---and those were strange also! I looked at my belly--and the belly belonged to some
one else!--Which signifies that I am devouring some other person's life.[45] Send for the priest;
and in the meanwhile, lay me on my bed, from which I shall not rise again."

Malánya Pávlovna was in utter consternation, but she put the old man to bed, and sent for the
priest. Alexyéi Sergyéitch made his confession, received the holy communion, took leave of
the members of his household, and began to sink into a stupor. Malánya Pávlovna was sitting
beside his bed.

"Alexis!" she suddenly shrieked, "do not frighten me, do not close thy dear eyes! Hast thou
any pain?"

The old man looked at his wife.--"No, I have no pain ... but I find it ... rather difficult
... difficult to breathe." Then, after a brief pause:--"Malániushka," he said, "now life has
galloped past--but dost thou remember our wedding ... what a fine young couple we were?"

"We were, my beauty, Alexis my incomparable one!"

Again the old man remained silent for a space.

"And shall we meet again in the other world, Malániushka?"

"I shall pray to God that we may, Alexis."--And the old woman burst into tears.

"Come, don't cry, silly one; perchance the Lord God will make us young again there--and we
shall again be a fine young pair!"

"He will make us young, Alexis!"

"Everything is possible to Him, to the Lord," remarked Alexyéi Sergyéitch.--"He is a worker
of wonders!--I presume He will make thee a clever woman also.... Come, my dear, I was jesting;
give me thy hand to kiss."

"And I will kiss thine."

And the two old people kissed each other's hands.

Alexyéi Sergyéitch began to quiet down and sink into a comatose state. Malánya Pávlovna gazed
at him with emotion, brushing the tears from her eyelashes with the tip of her finger. She
sat thus for a couple of hours.

"Has he fallen asleep?" asked in a whisper the old woman who knew how to pray so tastily, peering
out from behind Irinárkh, who was standing as motionless as a pillar at the door, and staring
intently at his dying master.

"Yes," replied Malánya Pávlovna, also in a whisper. And suddenly Alexyéi Sergyéitch opened
his eyes.

"My faithful companion," he stammered, "my respected spouse, I would like to bow myself to
thy feet for all thy love and faithfulness--but how am I to rise? Let me at least sign thee
with the cross."

Malánya Pávlovna drew nearer, bent over.... But the hand which had been raised fell back powerless
on the coverlet, and a few moments later Alexyéi Sergyéitch ceased to be.

His daughters with their husbands only arrived in time for the funeral; neither one of them
had any children. Alexyéi Sergyéitch had not discriminated against them in his will, although
he had not referred to them on his death-bed.

"My heart is locked against them," he had said to me one day. Knowing his kind-heartedness,
I was surprised at his words.--It is a difficult matter to judge between parents and children.--"A
vast ravine begins with a tiny rift," Alexyéi Sergyéitch had said to me on another occasion,
referring to the same subject. "A wound an arshín long will heal over, but if you cut off so
much as a nail, it will not grow again!"

I have an idea that the daughters were ashamed of their eccentric old folks.

A month later Malánya Pávlovna expired also. She hardly rose from her bed again after the day
of Alexyéi Sergyéitch's death, and did not array herself; but they buried her in the blue jacket,
and with the medal of Orlóff on her shoulder, only minus the diamonds. The daughters shared
those between them, under the pretext that those diamonds were to be used for the setting of
holy pictures; but as a matter of fact they used them to adorn their own persons.

And now how vividly do my old people stand before me, and what a good memory I cherish of them!
And yet, during my very last visit to them (I was already a student at the time) an incident
occurred which injected some discord into the harmoniously-patriarchal mood with which the
Telyégin house inspired me.

Among the number of the household serfs was a certain Iván, nicknamed "Sukhíkh--the coachman,
or the little coachman, as he was called, on account of his small size, in spite of his years,
which were not few. He was a tiny scrap of a man, nimble, snub-nosed, curly-haired, with a
perennial smile on his infantile countenance, and little, mouse-like eyes. He was a great joker
and buffoon; he was able to acquire any trick; he set off fireworks, snakes, played all card-games,
galloped his horse while standing erect on it, flew higher than any one else in the swing,
and even knew how to present Chinese shadows. There was no one who could amuse children better
than he, and he would have been only too glad to occupy himself with them all day long. When
he got to laughing he set the whole house astir. People would answer him from this point and
that--every one would join in.... They would both abuse him and laugh.--Iván danced marvellously--especially
'the fish.'--The chorus would thunder out a dance tune, the young fellow would step into the
middle of the circle, and begin to leap and twist about and stamp his feet, and then come down
with a crash on the ground--and there represent the movements of a fish which has been thrown
out of the water upon the dry land; and he would writhe about this way and that, and even bring
his heels up to his neck; and then, when he sprang to his feet and began to shout, the earth
would simply tremble beneath him! Alexyéi Sergyéitch was extremely fond of choral songs and
dances, as I have already said; he could never refrain from shouting: 'Send hither Vániushka!
the little coachman! Give us 'the fish,' be lively!'--and a minute later he would whisper in
ecstasy: 'Akh, what a devil of a man he is!'"

Well, then,--on my last visit this same Iván Sukhíkh comes to me in my room, and without uttering
a word plumps down on his knees.

"What is the matter with thee, Iván?"

"Save me, master!"

"Why, what's the trouble?"

And thereupon Iván related to me his grief.

He had been swapped twenty years previously by the Messrs. Sukhóy for another serf, a man belonging
to the Telyégins--he had simply been exchanged, without any formalities and documents. The
man who had been given in exchange for him had died, but the Messrs. Sukhóy had forgotten all
about Iván and had left him in Alexyéi Sergyéitch's house as his property; his nickname alone
served as a reminder of his origin.[46]--But lo and behold! his former owners had died also,
their estate had fallen into other hands, and the new owner, concerning whom rumours were in
circulation to the effect that he was a cruel man, a torturer, having learned that one of his
serfs was to be found at Alexyéi Sergyéitch's without any passport and right, began to demand
his return; in case of refusal he threatened to have recourse to the courts and a penalty--and
he did not threaten idly, as he himself held the rank of Privy Councillor,[47] and had great
weight in the government.[48] Iván, in his affright, darted to Alexyéi Sergyéitch. The old
man was sorry for his dancer, and he offered to buy Iván from the privy councillor at a good
price; but the privy councillor would not hear of such a thing; he was a Little Russian and
obstinate as the devil. The poor fellow had to be surrendered.

"I have got used to living here, I have made myself at home here, I have eaten bread here,
and here I wish to die," Ivan said to me--and there was no grin on his face now; on the contrary,
he seemed turned into stone.... "But now I must go to that malefactor.... Am I a dog that I
am to be driven from one kennel to another with a slip-noose round my neck--and a 'take that'?
Save me, master; entreat your uncle,--remember how I have always amused you.... Or something
bad will surely come of it; the matter will not pass off without sin."

"Without what sin, Iván?"

"Why, I will kill that gentleman.--When I arrive I shall say to him: 'Let me go back, master;
otherwise, look out, beware.... I will kill you.'"

If a chaffinch or a bullfinch could talk and had begun to assure me that it would claw another
bird, it would not have caused me greater astonishment than did Iván on that occasion.--What!
Ványa Sukhíkh, that dancer, jester, buffoon, that favourite of the children, and a child himself--that
kindest-hearted of beings--a murderer! What nonsense! I did not believe him for a single moment.
I was startled in the extreme that he should have been able to utter such a word! Nevertheless,
I betook myself to Alexyéi Sergyéitch. I did not repeat to him what Iván had said to me, but
I tried in every way to beg him to see whether he could not set the matter right.

"My little sir," the old man replied to me, "I would be only too delighted, but how can I?--I
have offered that Topknot[49] huge remuneration. I offered him three hundred rubles, I assure
thee on my honour! but in vain. What is one to do? We had acted illegally, on faith, after
the ancient fashion ... and now see what a bad thing has come of it! I am sure that Topknot
will take Iván from me by force the first thing we know; he has a strong hand, the Governor
eats sour cabbage-soup with him--the Topknot will send a soldier! I'm afraid of those soldiers!
In former days, there's no denying it, I would have defended Iván,--but just look at me now,
how decrepit I have grown. How am I to wage war?"--And, in fact, during my last visit I found
that Alexyéi Sergyéitch had aged very greatly; even the pupils of his eyes had acquired a milky
hue--like that in infants--and on his lips there appeared not the discerning smile of former
days, but that strainedly-sweet, unconscious smirk which never leaves the faces of very old
people even in their sleep.

I imparted Alexyéi Sergyéitch's decision to Iván. He stood a while, held his peace, and shook
his head.--"Well," he said at last, "what is fated to be cannot be avoided. Only my word is
firm. That is to say: only one thing remains for me ... play the wag to the end.--Master, please
give me something for liquor!" I gave it; he drank himself drunk--and on that same day he danced
"the fish" in such wise that the maidens and married women fairly squealed with delight, so
whimsically amusing was he.

The next day I went home, and three months later--when I was already in Petersburg--I learned
that Iván had actually kept his word!--He had been sent to his new master; his master had summoned
him to his study and announced to him that he was to serve as his coachman, that he entrusted
him with a tróika of Vyátka horses,[50] and that he should exact a strict account from him
if he treated them badly, and, in general, if he were not punctual.--"I'm not fond of jesting,"
he said.--Iván listened to his master, first made obeisance to his very feet, and then informed
him that it was as his mercy liked, but he could not be his servant.--"Release me on quit-rent,
Your High-Born," he said, "or make a soldier of me; otherwise there will be a catastrophe before
long."

The master flared up.--"Akh, damn thee! What is this thou darest to say to me?--Know, in the
first place, that I am 'Your Excellency,' and not 'Your High-Born'; in the second place, thou
art beyond the age, and thy size is not such that I can hand thee over as a soldier; and, in
conclusion,--what calamity art thou threatening me with? Art thou preparing to commit arson?"

"No, your Excellency, not to commit arson."

"To kill me, then, pray?"

Iván maintained a stubborn silence.--"I will not be your servant," he said at last.

"Here, then, I'll show thee," roared the gentleman, "whether thou wilt be my servant or not!"--And
after having cruelly flogged Iván, he nevertheless ordered that the tróika of Vyátka horses
should be placed in his charge, and appointed him a coachman at the stables.

Iván submitted, to all appearances; he began to drive as coachman. As he was a proficient in
that line his master speedily took a fancy to him,--the more so as Iván behaved very discreetly
and quietly, and the horses throve under his care; he tended them so that they became as plump
as cucumbers,--one could never leave off admiring them! The master began to drive out more
frequently with him than with the other coachmen. He used to ask: "Dost thou remember, Iván,
how unpleasant was thy first meeting with me? I think thou hast got rid of thy folly?" But
to these words Iván never made any reply.

So, then, one day, just before the Epiphany, the master set out for the town with Iván in his
tróika with bells, in a broad sledge lined with rugs. The horses began to ascend a hill at
a walk, while Iván descended from the box and went back to the sledge, as though he had dropped
something.--The cold was very severe. The master sat there all wrapped up, and with his beaver
cap drawn down over his ears. Then Iván pulled a hatchet out from under the skirts of his coat,
approached his master from behind, knocked off his cap, and saying: "I warned thee, Piótr Petróvitch--now
thou hast thyself to thank for this!"--he laid open his head with one slash. Then he brought
the horses to a standstill, put the cap back on his murdered master's head, and again mounting
the box, he drove him to the town, straight to the court-house.

"Here's the general from Sukhóy for you, murdered; and I killed him.--I told him I would do
it, and I have done it. Bind me!"

They seized Iván, tried him, condemned him to the knout and then to penal servitude.--The merry,
bird-like dancer reached the mines--and there vanished forever....

Yes; involuntarily--although in a different sense,--one repeats with Alexyéi Sergyéitch:--"The
old times were good ... well, yes, but God be with them! I want nothing to do with them!"

THE SONG OF LOVE TRIUMPHANT

(1881)

                 MDXLII

DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF GUSTAVE FLAUBERT

    Wage du zu irren und zu träumen!
                                 SCHILLER.

The following is what I read in an Italian manuscript:

I

About the middle of the sixteenth century there dwelt in Ferrara--(it was then flourishing
under the sceptre of its magnificent dukes, the patrons of the arts and of poetry)--there dwelt
two young men, named Fabio and Muzio. Of the same age and nearly related, they were almost
never separated; a sincere friendship had united them since their early childhood, and a similarity
of fate had strengthened this bond. Both belonged to ancient families; both were wealthy, independent,
and without family; the tastes and inclinations of both were similar. Muzio occupied himself
with music, Fabio with painting. All Ferrara was proud of them as the finest ornaments of the
Court, of society, and of the city. But in personal appearance they did not resemble each other,
although both were distinguished for their stately, youthful beauty. Fabio was the taller of
the two, white of complexion, with ruddy-gold hair, and had blue eyes. Muzio, on the contrary,
had a swarthy face, black hair, and in his dark-brown eyes there was not that merry gleam,
on his lips not that cordial smile, which Fabio had; his thick eyebrows over-hung his narrow
eyelids, while Fabio's golden brows rose in slender arches on his pure, smooth forehead. Muzio
was less animated in conversation also; nevertheless both friends were equally favoured by
the ladies; for not in vain were they models of knightly courtesy and lavishness.

At one and the same time with them there dwelt in Ferrara a maiden named Valeria. She was considered
one of the greatest beauties in the city, although she was to be seen only very rarely, as
she led a retired life and left her house only to go to church;--and on great festivals for
a walk. She lived with her mother, a nobly-born but not wealthy widow, who had no other children.
Valeria inspired in every one whom she met a feeling of involuntary amazement and of equally
involuntary tender respect: so modest was her mien, so little aware was she, to all appearance,
of the full force of her charms. Some persons, it is true, thought her rather pale; the glance
of her eyes, which were almost always lowered, expressed a certain shyness and even timidity;
her lips smiled rarely, and then but slightly; hardly ever did any one hear her voice. But
a rumour was in circulation to the effect that it was very beautiful, and that, locking herself
in her chamber, early in the morning, while everything in the city was still sleeping, she
loved to warble ancient ballads to the strains of a lute, upon which she herself played. Despite
the pallor of her face, Valeria was in blooming health; and even the old people, as they looked
on her, could not refrain from thinking:--"Oh, how happy will be that young man for whom this
bud still folded in its petals, still untouched and virgin, shall at last unfold itself!"

II

Fabio and Muzio beheld Valeria for the first time at a sumptuous popular festival, got up at
the command of the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole, son of the famous Lucrezia Borgia, in honour of
some distinguished grandees who had arrived from Paris on the invitation of the Duchess, the
daughter of Louis XII, King of France. Side by side with her mother sat Valeria in the centre
of an elegant tribune, erected after drawings by Palladius on the principal square of Ferrara
for the most honourable ladies of the city. Both Fabio and Muzio fell passionately in love
with her that day; and as they concealed nothing from each other, each speedily learned what
was going on in his comrade's heart. They agreed between themselves that they would both try
to make close acquaintance with Valeria, and if she should deign to choose either one of them
the other should submit without a murmur to her decision.

Several weeks later, thanks to the fine reputation which they rightfully enjoyed, they succeeded
in penetrating into the not easily accessible house of the widow; she gave them permission
to visit her. From that time forth they were able to see Valeria almost every day and to converse
with her;--and with every day the flame kindled in the hearts of both young men blazed more
and more vigorously. But Valeria displayed no preference for either of them, although their
presence evidently pleased her. With Muzio she occupied herself with music; but she chatted
more with Fabio: she was less shy with him. At last they decided to learn their fate definitely,
and sent to Valeria a letter wherein they asked her to explain herself and say on whom she
was prepared to bestow her hand. Valeria showed this letter to her mother, and informed her
that she was content to remain unmarried; but if her mother thought it was time for her to
marry, she would wed the man of her mother's choice. The honourable widow shed a few tears
at the thought of parting from her beloved child; but there was no reason for rejecting the
suitors: she considered them both equally worthy of her daughter's hand. But as she secretly
preferred Fabio, and suspected that he was more to Valeria's taste also, she fixed upon him.
On the following day Fabio learned of his happiness: and all that was left to Muzio was to
keep his word and submit.

This he did; but he was not able to be a witness to the triumph of his friend, his rival. He
immediately sold the greater part of his property, and collecting a few thousand ducats, he
set off on a long journey to the Orient. On taking leave of Fabio he said to him that he would
not return until he should feel that the last traces of passion in him had vanished. It was
painful for Fabio to part from the friend of his childhood and his youth ... but the joyful
anticipation of approaching bliss speedily swallowed up all other sentiments--and he surrendered
himself completely to the transports of happy love.

He soon married Valeria, and only then did he learn the full value of the treasure which it
had fallen to his lot to possess. He had a very beautiful villa at a short distance from Ferrara;
he removed thither with his wife and her mother. A bright time then began for them. Wedded
life displayed in a new and captivating light all Valeria's perfections. Fabio became a remarkable
artist,---no longer a mere amateur, but a master. Valeria's mother rejoiced and returned thanks
to God as she gazed at the happy pair. Four years flew by unnoticed like a blissful dream.
One thing alone was lacking to the young married couple, one thing caused them grief: they
had no children ... but hope had not deserted them. Toward the end of the fourth year a great,
and this time a genuine grief, visited them: Valeria's mother died, after an illness of a few days.

Valeria shed many tears; for a long time she could not reconcile herself to her loss. But another
year passed; life once more asserted its rights and flowed on in its former channel. And, lo!
one fine summer evening, without having forewarned any one, Muzio returned to Ferrara.

III

During the whole five years which had elapsed since his departure, no one had known anything
about him. All rumours concerning him had died out, exactly as though he had vanished from
the face of the earth. When Fabio met his friend on one of the streets in Ferrara he came near
crying out aloud, first from fright, then from joy, and immediately invited him to his villa.
There, in the garden, was a spacious, detached pavilion; he suggested that his friend should
settle down in that pavilion. Muzio gladly accepted, and that same day removed thither with
his servant, a dumb Malay--dumb but not deaf, and even, judging from the vivacity of his glance,
a very intelligent man.... His tongue had been cut out. Muzio had brought with him scores of
chests filled with divers precious things which he had collected during his prolonged wanderings.

Valeria was delighted at Muzio's return; and he greeted her in a cheerfully-friendly but composed
manner. From everything it was obvious that he had kept the promise made to Fabio. In the course
of the day he succeeded in installing himself in his pavilion; with the aid of his Malay he
set out the rarities he had brought--rugs, silken tissues, garments of velvet and brocade,
weapons, cups, dishes, and beakers adorned with enamel, articles of gold and silver set with
pearls and turquoises, carved caskets of amber and ivory, faceted flasks, spices, perfumes,
pelts of wild beasts, the feathers of unknown birds, and a multitude of other objects, the
very use of which seemed mysterious and incomprehensible. Among the number of all these precious
things there was one rich pearl necklace which Muzio had received from the Shah of Persia for
a certain great and mysterious service; he asked Valeria's permission to place this necklace
on her neck with his own hand; it seemed to her heavy, and as though endowed with a strange
sort of warmth ... it fairly adhered to the skin. Toward evening, after dinner, as they sat
on the terrace of the villa, in the shade of oleanders and laurels, Muzio began to narrate
his adventures. He told of the distant lands which he had seen, of mountains higher than the
clouds, of rivers like unto seas; he told of vast buildings and temples, of trees thousands
of years old, of rainbow-hued flowers and birds; he enumerated the cities and peoples he had
visited.... (their very names exhaled something magical). All the Orient was familiar to Muzio:
he had traversed Persia and Arabia, where the horses are more noble and beautiful than all
other living creatures; he had penetrated the depths of India, where is a race of people resembling
magnificent plants; he had attained to the confines of China and Tibet, where a living god,
the Dalai Lama by name, dwells upon earth in the form of a speechless man with narrow eyes.
Marvellous were his tales! Fabio and Valeria listened to him as though enchanted.

In point of fact, Muzio's features had undergone but little change: swarthy from childhood,
his face had grown still darker,--had been burned beneath the rays of a more brilliant sun,--his
eyes seemed more deeply set than of yore, that was all; but the expression of that face had
become different: concentrated, grave, it did not grow animated even when he alluded to the
dangers to which he had been subjected by night in the forests, deafened by the roar of tigers,
by day on deserted roads where fanatics lie in wait for travellers and strangle them in honour
of an iron goddess who demands human blood. And Muzio's voice had grown more quiet and even;
the movements of his hands, of his whole body, had lost the flourishing ease which is peculiar
to the Italian race.

With the aid of his servant, the obsequiously-alert Malay, he showed his host and hostess several
tricks which he had been taught by the Brahmins of India. Thus, for example, having preliminarily
concealed himself behind a curtain, he suddenly appeared sitting in the air, with his legs
doubled up beneath him, resting the tips of his fingers lightly on a bamboo rod set upright,
which not a little amazed and even alarmed Fabio and Valeria.... "Can it be that he is a magician?"
the thought occurred to her.--But when he set to calling out tame snakes from a covered basket
by whistling on a small flute,--when, wiggling their fangs, their dark, flat heads made their
appearance from beneath the motley stuff, Valeria became frightened and begged Muzio to hide
away those horrors as quickly as possible.

At supper Muzio regaled his friends with wine of Shiraz from a round flask with a long neck;
extremely fragrant and thick, of a golden hue, with greenish lights, it sparkled mysteriously
when poured into the tiny jasper cups. In taste it did not resemble European wines: it was
very sweet and spicy; and, quaffed slowly, in small sips, it produced in all the limbs a sensation
of agreeable drowsiness. Muzio made Fabio and Valeria drink a cup apiece, and drank one himself.
Bending over her cup, he whispered something and shook his fingers. Valeria noticed this; but
as there was something strange and unprecedented in all Muzio's ways in general, and in all
his habits, she merely thought: "I wonder if he has not accepted in India some new faith, or
whether they have such customs there?"--Then, after a brief pause, she asked him: "Had he continued
to occupy himself with music during the time of his journeys?"--In reply Muzio ordered the
Malay to bring him his Indian violin. It resembled those of the present day, only, instead
of four strings it had three; a bluish snake-skin was stretched across its top, and the slender
bow of reed was semi-circular in form, and on its very tip glittered a pointed diamond.

Muzio first played several melancholy airs,--which were, according to his assertion, popular
ballads,--strange and even savage to the Italian ear; the sound of the metallic strings was
plaintive and feeble. But when Muzio began the last song, that same sound suddenly strengthened,
quivered powerfully and resonantly; the passionate melody poured forth from beneath the broadly-handled
bow,--poured forth with beautiful undulations, like the snake which had covered the top of
the violin with its skin; and with so much fire, with so much triumphant joy did this song
beam and blaze that both Fabio and Valeria felt a tremor at their heart, and the tears started
to their eyes ... while Muzio, with his head bent down and pressed against his violin, with
pallid cheeks, and brows contracted into one line, seemed still more concentrated and serious
than ever, and the diamond at the tip of the bow scattered ray-like sparks in its flight, as
though it also were kindled with the fire of that wondrous song. And when Muzio had finished
and, still holding the violin tightly pressed between his chin and his shoulder, dropped his
hand which held the bow--"What is that? What hast thou been playing to us?" Fabio exclaimed.--Valeria
uttered not a word, but her whole being seemed to repeat her husband's question. Muzio laid
the violin on the table, and lightly shaking back his hair, said, with a courteous smile: "That?
That melody ... that song I heard once on the island of Ceylon. That song is known there, among
the people, as the song of happy, satisfied love."

"Repeat it," whispered Fabio.

"No; it is impossible to repeat it," replied Muzio. "And it is late now. Signora Valeria ought
to rest; and it is high time for me also.... I am weary."

All day long Muzio had treated Valeria in a respectfully-simple manner, like a friend of long
standing; but as he took leave he pressed her hand very hard, jamming his fingers into her
palm, staring so intently into her face the while that she, although she did not raise her
eyelids, felt conscious of that glance on her suddenly-flushing cheeks. She said nothing to
Muzio, but drew away her hand, and when he was gone she stared at the door through which he
had made his exit. She recalled how, in former years also, she had been afraid of him ... and
now she was perplexed. Muzio went off to his pavilion; the husband and wife withdrew to their
bed-chamber.

IV

Valeria did not soon fall asleep; her blood was surging softly and languidly, and there was
a faint ringing in her head ... from that strange wine, as she supposed, and, possibly, also
from Muzio's tales, from his violin playing.... Toward morning she fell asleep at last, and
had a remarkable dream.

It seems to her that she enters a spacious room with a low, vaulted ceiling.... She has never
seen such a room in her life. All the walls are set with small blue tiles bearing golden patterns;
slender carved pillars of alabaster support the marble vault; this vault and the pillars seem
semi-transparent.... A pale, rose-coloured light penetrates the room from all directions, illuminating
all the objects mysteriously and monotonously; cushions of gold brocade lie on a narrow rug
in the very middle of the floor, which is as smooth as a mirror. In the corners, barely visible,
two tall incense-burners, representing monstrous animals, are smoking; there are no windows
anywhere; the door, screened by a velvet drapery, looms silently black in a niche of the wall.
And suddenly this curtain softly slips aside, moves away ... and Muzio enters. He bows, opens
his arms, smiles.... His harsh arms encircle Valeria's waist; his dry lips have set her to
burning all over.... She falls prone on the cushions....

       *       *       *       *       *

Moaning with fright, Valeria awoke after long efforts.--Still not comprehending where she is
and what is the matter with her, she half raises herself up in bed and looks about her....
A shudder runs through her whole body.... Fabio is lying beside her. He is asleep; but his
face, in the light of the round, clear moon, is as pale as that of a corpse ... it is more
melancholy than the face of a corpse. Valeria awoke her husband--and no sooner had he cast
a glance at her than he exclaimed: "What is the matter with thee?"

"I have seen ... I have seen a dreadful dream," she whispered, still trembling....

But at that moment, from the direction of the pavilion, strong sounds were wafted to them--and
both Fabio and Valeria recognised the melody which Muzio had played to them, calling it the
Song of Love Triumphant.--Fabio cast a glance of surprise at Valeria.... She closed her eyes,
and turned away--and both, holding their breath, listened to the song to the end. When the
last sound died away the moon went behind a cloud, it suddenly grew dark in the room.... The
husband and wife dropped their heads on their pillows, without exchanging a word, and neither
of them noticed when the other fell asleep.

V

On the following morning Muzio came to breakfast; he seemed pleased, and greeted Valeria merrily.
She answered him with confusion,-- scrutinised him closely, and was startled by that pleased,
merry face, those piercing and curious eyes. Muzio was about to begin his stories again ...
but Fabio stopped him at the first word.

"Evidently, thou wert not able to sleep in a new place? My wife and I heard thee playing the
song of last night."

"Yes? Did you hear it?"--said Muzio.--"I did play it, in fact; but I had been asleep before
that, and I had even had a remarkable dream."

Valeria pricked up her ears.--"What sort of a dream?" inquired Fabio.

"I seemed," replied Muzio, without taking his eyes from Valeria, "to see myself enter a spacious
apartment with a vaulted ceiling, decorated in Oriental style. Carved pillars supported the
vault; the walls were covered with tiles, and although there were no windows nor candles, yet
the whole room was filled with a rosy light, just as though it had all been built of transparent
stone. In the corners Chinese incense-burners were smoking; on the floor lay cushions of brocade,
along a narrow rug. I entered through a door hung with a curtain, and from another door directly
opposite a woman whom I had once loved made her appearance. And she seemed to me so beautiful
that I became all aflame with my love of days gone by...."

Muzio broke off significantly. Valeria sat motionless, only paling slowly ... and her breathing
grew more profound.

"Then," pursued Muzio, "I woke up and played that song."

"But who was the woman?" said Fabio.

"Who was she? The wife of an East Indian. I met her in the city of Delhi.... She is no longer
among the living. She is dead."

"And her husband?" asked Fabio, without himself knowing why he did so.

"Her husband is dead also, they say. I soon lost sight of them."

"Strange!" remarked Fabio.--"My wife also had a remarkable dream last night--which she did
not relate to me," added Fabio.

But at this point Valeria rose and left the room. Immediately after breakfast Muzio also went
away, asserting that he was obliged to go to Ferrara on business, and that he should not return
before evening.

VI

Several weeks before Muzio's return Fabio had begun a portrait of his wife, depicting her with
the attributes of Saint Cecilia.--He had made noteworthy progress in his art; the famous Luini,
the pupil of Leonardo da Vinci, had come to him in Ferrara, and aiding him with his own advice,
had also imparted to him the precepts of his great master. The portrait was almost finished;
it only remained for him to complete the face by a few strokes of the brush, and then Fabio
might feel justly proud of his work.

When Muzio departed to Ferrara, Fabio betook himself to his studio, where Valeria was generally
awaiting him; but he did not find her there; he called to her--she did not respond. A secret
uneasiness took possession of Fabio; he set out in quest of her. She was not in the house;
Fabio ran into the garden--and there, in one of the most remote alleys, he descried Valeria.
With head bowed upon her breast, and hands clasped on her knees, she was sitting on a bench,
and behind her, standing out against the dark green of a cypress, a marble satyr, with face
distorted in a malicious smile, was applying his pointed lips to his reed-pipes. Valeria was
visibly delighted at her husband's appearance, and in reply to his anxious queries she said
that she had a slight headache, but that it was of no consequence, and that she was ready for
the sitting. Fabio conducted her to his studio, posed her, and took up his brush; but, to his
great vexation, he could not possibly finish the face as he would have liked. And that not
because it was somewhat pale and seemed fatigued ... no; but he did not find in it that day
the pure, holy expression which he so greatly loved in it, and which had suggested to him the
idea of representing Valeria in the form of Saint Cecilia. At last he flung aside his brush,
told his wife that he was not in the mood, that ft would do her good to lie down for a while,
as she was not feeling quite well, to judge by her looks,--and turned his easel so that the
portrait faced the wall. Valeria agreed with him that she ought to rest, and repeating her
complaint of headache, she retired to her chamber.

Fabio remained in the studio. He felt a strange agitation which was incomprehensible even to
himself. Muzio's sojourn under his roof, a sojourn which he, Fabio, had himself invited, embarrassed
him. And it was not that he was jealous ... was it possible to be jealous of Valeria?--but
in his friend he did not recognise his former comrade. All that foreign, strange, new element
which Muzio had brought with him from those distant lands--and which, apparently, had entered
into his very flesh and blood,---all those magical processes, songs, strange beverages, that
dumb Malay, even the spicy odour which emanated from Muzio's garments, from his hair, his breath,--all
this inspired in Fabio a feeling akin to distrust, nay, even to timidity. And why did that
Malay, when serving at table, gaze upon him, Fabio, with such disagreeable intentness? Really,
one might suppose that he understood Italian. Muzio had said concerning him, that that Malay,
in paying the penalty with his tongue, had made a great sacrifice, and in compensation now
possessed great power.--What power? And how could he have acquired it at the cost of his tongue?
All this was very strange! Very incomprehensible!

Fabio went to his wife in her chamber; she was lying on the bed fully dressed, but was not
asleep.--On hearing his footsteps she started, then rejoiced again to see him, as she had done
in the garden. Fabio sat down by the bed, took Valeria's hand, and after a brief pause, he
asked her, "What was that remarkable dream which had frightened her during the past night?
And had it been in the nature of that dream which Muzio had related?"

Valeria blushed and said hastily--"Oh, no! no! I saw ... some sort of a monster, which tried
to rend me."

"A monster? In the form of a man?" inquired Fabio.

"No, a wild beast ... a wild beast!"--And Valeria turned away and hid her flaming face in the
pillows. Fabio held his wife's hand for a while longer; silently he raised it to his lips,
and withdrew.

The husband and wife passed a dreary day. It seemed as though something dark were hanging over
their heads ... but what it was, they could not tell. They wanted to be together, as though
some danger were menacing them;--but what to say to each other, they did not know. Fabio made
an effort to work at the portrait, to read Ariosto, whose poem, which had recently made its
appearance in Ferrara, was already famous throughout Italy; but he could do nothing.... Late
in the evening, just in time for supper, Muzio returned.

VII

He appeared calm and contented--but related few stories; he chiefly interrogated Fabio concerning
their mutual acquaintances of former days, the German campaign, the Emperor Charles; he spoke
of his desire to go to Rome, to have a look at the new Pope. Again he offered Valeria wine
of Shiraz--and in reply to her refusal he said, as though to himself, "It is not necessary now."

On returning with his wife to their bedroom Fabio speedily fell asleep ... and waking an hour
later was able to convince himself that no one shared his couch: Valeria was not with him.
He hastily rose, and at the selfsame moment he beheld his wife, in her night-dress, enter the
room from the garden. The moon was shining brightly, although not long before a light shower
had passed over.--With widely-opened eyes, and an expression of secret terror on her impassive
face, Valeria approached the bed, and fumbling for it with her hands, which were outstretched
in front of her, she lay down hurriedly and in silence. Fabio asked her a question, but she
made no reply; she seemed to be asleep. He touched her, and felt rain-drops on her clothing,
on her hair, and grains of sand on the soles of her bare feet. Then he sprang up and rushed
into the garden through the half-open door. The moonlight, brilliant to harshness, inundated
all objects. Fabio looked about him and descried on the sand of the path traces of two pairs
of feet; one pair was bare; and those tracks led to an arbour covered with jasmin, which stood
apart, between the pavilion and the house. He stopped short in perplexity; and lo! suddenly
the notes of that song which he had heard on the preceding night again rang forth! Fabio shuddered,
and rushed into the pavilion.... Muzio was standing in the middle of the room, playing on his
violin. Fabio darted to him.

"Thou hast been in the garden, thou hast been out, thy clothing is damp with rain."

"No.... I do not know ... I do not think ... that I have been out of doors ..." replied Muzio,
in broken accents, as though astonished at Fabio's advent, and at his agitation.

Fabio grasped him by the arm.--"And why art thou playing that melody again? Hast thou had another
dream?"

Muzio glanced at Fabio with the same surprise as before, and made no answer.

"Come, answer me!"

    "The moon is steel, like a circular shield....
    The river gleams like a snake....
    The friend is awake, the enemy sleeps--
    The hawk seizes the chicken in his claws....
    Help!"

mumbled Muzio, in a singsong, as though in a state of unconsciousness.

Fabio retreated a couple of paces, fixed his eyes on Muzio, meditated for a space ... and returned
to his house, to the bed-chamber.

With her head inclined upon her shoulder, and her arms helplessly outstretched, Valeria was
sleeping heavily. He did not speedily succeed in waking her ... but as soon as she saw him
she flung herself on his neck, and embraced him convulsively; her whole body was quivering.

"What aileth thee, my dear one, what aileth thee?" said Fabio repeatedly, striving to soothe her.

But she continued to lie as in a swoon on his breast. "Akh, what dreadful visions I see!" she
whispered, pressing her face against him.

Fabio attempted to question her ... but she merely trembled....

The window-panes were reddening with the first gleams of dawn when, at last, she fell asleep
in his arms.

VIII

On the following day Muzio disappeared early in the morning, and Valeria informed her husband
that she intended to betake herself to the neighbouring monastery, where dwelt her spiritual
father--an aged and stately monk, in whom she cherished unbounded confidence. To Fabio's questions
she replied that she desired to alleviate by confession her soul, which was oppressed with
the impressions of the last few days. As he gazed at Valeria's sunken visage, as he listened
to her faint voice, Fabio himself approved of her plan: venerable Father Lorenzo might be able
to give her useful advice, disperse her doubts.... Under the protection of four escorts, Valeria
set out for the monastery, but Fabio remained at home; and while awaiting the return of his
wife, he roamed about the garden, trying to understand what had happened to her, and feeling
the unremitting terror and wrath and pain of indefinite suspicions.... More than once he entered
the pavilion; but Muzio had not returned, and the Malay stared at Fabio like a statue, with
an obsequious inclination of his head, and a far-away grin--at least, so it seemed to Fabio--a
far-away grin on his bronze countenance.

In the meantime Valeria had narrated everything in confession to her confessor, being less
ashamed than frightened. The confessor listened to her attentively, blessed her, absolved her
from her involuntary sins,--but thought to himself: "Magic, diabolical witchcraft ... things
cannot be left in this condition".... and accompanied Valeria to her villa, ostensibly for
the purpose of definitely calming and comforting her.

At the sight of the confessor Fabio was somewhat startled; but the experienced old man had
already thought out beforehand how he ought to proceed. On being left alone with Fabio, he
did not, of course, betray the secrets of the confessional; but he advised him to banish from
his house, if that were possible, his invited guest who, by his tales, songs, and his whole
conduct, had upset Valeria's imagination. Moreover, in the old man's opinion, Muzio had not
been firm in the faith in days gone by, as he now recalled to mind; and after having sojourned
so long in regions not illuminated by the light of Christianity, he might have brought thence
the infection of false doctrines; he might even have dabbled in magic; and therefore, although
old friendship did assert its rights, still wise caution pointed to parting as indispensable.

Fabio thoroughly agreed with the venerable monk. Valeria even beamed all over when her husband
communicated to her her confessor's counsel; and accompanied by the good wishes of both husband
and wife, and provided with rich gifts for the monastery and the poor, Father Lorenzo wended
his way home.

Fabio had intended to have an explanation with Muzio directly after supper, but his strange
guest did not return to supper. Then Fabio decided to defer the interview with Muzio until
the following day, and husband and wife withdrew to their bed-chamber.

IX

Valeria speedily fell asleep; but Fabio could not get to sleep. In the nocturnal silence all
that he had seen, all that he had felt, presented itself to him in a still more vivid manner;
with still greater persistence did he ask himself questions, to which, as before, he found
no answer. Was Muzio really a magician? And had he already poisoned Valeria? She was ill ...
but with what malady? While he was engrossed in painful meditations, with his head propped
on his hand and restraining his hot breathing, the moon again rose in the cloudless sky; and
together with its rays, through the semi-transparent window-panes, in the direction of the
pavilion, there began to stream in--or did Fabio merely imagine it?--there began to stream
in a breath resembling a faint, perfumed current of air....

Now an importunate, passionate whisper began to make itself heard ... and at that same moment
he noticed that Valeria was beginning to stir slightly. He started, gazed; she rose, thrust
first one foot, then the other from the bed, and, like a somnambulist, with her dull eyes strained
straight ahead, and her arms extended before her, she advanced toward the door into the garden!
Fabio instantly sprang through the other door of the bedroom, and briskly running round the
corner of the house, he closed the one which led into the garden.... He had barely succeeded
in grasping the handle when he felt some one trying to open the door from within, throwing
their force against it ... more and more strongly ... then frightened moans resounded.

       *       *       *       *       *

"But Muzio cannot have returned from the town, surely," flashed through Fabio's head, and he
darted into the pavilion....

What did he behold?

Coming to meet him, along the path brilliantly flooded with the radiance of the moonlight,
also with arms outstretched and lifeless eyes staring widely--was Muzio.... Fabio ran up to
him, but the other, without noticing him, walked on, advancing with measured steps, and his
impassive face was smiling in the moonlight like the face of the Malay. Fabio tried to call
him by name ... but at that moment he heard a window bang in the house behind him.... He glanced
round....

In fact, the window of the bedroom was open from top to bottom, and with one foot thrust across
the sill stood Valeria in the window ... and her arms seemed to be seeking Muzio, her whole
being was drawn toward him.

Unspeakable wrath flooded Fabio's breast in a suddenly-invading torrent.--"Accursed sorcerer!"
he yelled fiercely, and seizing Muzio by the throat with one hand, he fumbled with the other
for the dagger in his belt, and buried its blade to the hilt in his side.

Muzio uttered a piercing shriek, and pressing the palm of his hand to the wound, fled, stumbling,
back to the pavilion.... But at that same instant, when Fabio stabbed him, Valeria uttered
an equally piercing shriek and fell to the ground like one mowed down.

Fabio rushed to her, raised her up, carried her to the bed, spoke to her....

For a long time she lay motionless; but at last she opened her eyes, heaved a deep sigh, convulsively
and joyously, like a person who has just been saved from inevitable death,--caught sight of
her husband, and encircling his neck with her arms, pressed herself to his breast.

"Thou, thou, it is thou," she stammered. Gradually the clasp of her arms relaxed, her head
sank backward, and whispering, with a blissful smile:--"Thank God, all is over.... But how
weary I am!"--she fell into a profound but not heavy slumber.

X

Fabio sank down beside her bed, and never taking his eyes from her pale, emaciated, but already
tranquil face, he began to reflect upon what had taken place ... and also upon how he ought
to proceed now. What was he to do? If he had slain Muzio--and when he recalled how deeply the
blade of his dagger had penetrated he could not doubt that he had done so--then it was impossible
to conceal the fact. He must bring it to the knowledge of the Duke, of the judges ... but how
was he to explain, how was he to narrate such an incomprehensible affair? He, Fabio, had slain
in his own house his relative, his best friend! People would ask, "What for? For what cause?..."
But what if Muzio were not slain?--Fabio had not the strength to remain any longer in uncertainty,
and having made sure that Valeria was asleep, he cautiously rose from his arm-chair, left the
house, and directed his steps toward the pavilion. All was silent in it; only in one window
was a light visible. With sinking heart he opened the outer door--(a trace of bloody fingers
still clung to it, and on the sand of the path drops of blood made black patches)-- raversed
the first dark chamber ... and halted on the threshold, petrified with astonishment.

In the centre of the room, on a Persian rug, with a brocade cushion under his head, covered
with a wide scarlet shawl with black figures, lay Muzio, with all his limbs stiffly extended.
His face, yellow as wax, with closed eyes and lids which had become blue, was turned toward
the ceiling, and no breath was to be detected: he seemed to be dead. At his feet, also enveloped
in a scarlet shawl, knelt the Malay. He held in his left hand a branch of some unfamiliar plant,
resembling a fern, and bending slightly forward, he was gazing at his master, never taking
his eyes from him. A small torch, thrust into the floor, burned with a greenish flame, and
was the only light in the room. Its flame did not flicker nor smoke.

The Malay did not stir at Fabio's entrance, but merely darted a glance at him and turned his
eyes again upon Muzio. From time to time he raised himself a little, and lowered the branch,
waving it through the air,--and his dumb lips slowly parted and moved, as though uttering inaudible
words. Between Muzio and the Malay there lay upon the floor the dagger with which Fabio had
stabbed his friend. The Malay smote the blood-stained blade with his bough. One minute passed
... then another. Fabio approached the Malay, and bending toward him, he said in a low voice:
"Is he dead?"--The Malay bowed his head, and disengaging his right hand from beneath the shawl,
pointed imperiously to the door. Fabio was about to repeat his question, but the imperious
hand repeated its gesture, and Fabio left the room, raging arid marvelling but submitting.

He found Valeria asleep, as before, with a still more tranquil face. He did not undress, but
seated himself by the window, propped his head on his hand, and again became immersed in thought.
The rising sun found him still in the same place. Valeria had not wakened.

XI

Fabio was intending to wait until she should awake, and then go to Ferrara--when suddenly some
one tapped lightly at the door of the bedroom. Fabio went out and beheld before him his aged
major-domo, Antonio.

"Signor," began the old man, "the Malay has just informed us that Signor Muzio is ailing and
desires to remove with all his effects to the town; and therefore he requests that you will
furnish him with the aid of some persons to pack his things--and that you will send, about
dinner-time, both pack-and saddle-horses and a few men as guard. Do you permit?"

"Did the Malay tell thee that?" inquired Fabio. "In what manner? For he is dumb."

"Here, signor, is a paper on which he wrote all this in our language, very correctly."

"And Muzio is ill, sayest thou?"

"Yes, very ill, and he cannot be seen."

"Has not a physician been sent for?"

"No; the Malay would not allow it."

"And was it the Malay who wrote this for thee?"

"Yes, it was he."

Fabio was silent for a space.

"Very well, take the necessary measures," he said at last.

Antonio withdrew.

Fabio stared after his servant in perplexity.--"So he was not killed?"--he thought ... and
he did not know whether to rejoice or to grieve.--"He is ill?"--But a few hours ago he had
beheld him a corpse!

Fabio returned to Valeria. She was awake, and raised her head. The husband and wife exchanged
a long, significant look.

"Is he already dead?" said Valeria suddenly.--Fabio shuddered.

"What ... he is not?--Didst thou.... Has he gone away?" she went on.

Fabio's heart was relieved.--"Not yet; but he is going away to-day."

"And I shall never, never see him again?"

"Never."

"And those visions will not be repeated?"

"No."

Valeria heaved another sigh of relief; a blissful smile again made its appearance on her lips.
She put out both hands to her husband.

"And we shall never speak of him, never, hearest thou, my dear one. And I shall not leave this
room until he is gone. But now do thou send me my serving-women ... and stay: take that thing!"--she
pointed to a pearl necklace which lay on the night-stand, the necklace which Muzio had given
her,---"and throw it immediately into our deep well. Embrace me--I am thy Valeria--and do not
come to me until ... that man is gone."

Fabio took the necklace--its pearls seemed to have grown dim--and fulfilled his wife's behest.
Then he began to roam about the garden, gazing from a distance at the pavilion, around which
the bustle of packing was already beginning. Men were carrying out chests, lading horses ...
but the Malay was not among them. An irresistible feeling drew Fabio to gaze once more on what
was going on in the pavilion. He recalled the fact that in its rear façade there was a secret
door through which one might penetrate to the interior of the chamber where Muzio had been
lying that morning. He stole up to that door, found it unlocked, and pushing aside the folds
of a heavy curtain, darted in an irresolute glance.

XII

Muzio was no longer lying on the rug. Dressed in travelling attire, he was sitting in an arm-chair,
but appeared as much of a corpse as at Fabio's first visit. The petrified head had fallen against
the back of the chair, the hands lay flat, motionless, and yellow on the knees. His breast
did not heave. Round about the chair, on the floor strewn with dried herbs, stood several flat
cups filled with a dark liquid which gave off a strong, almost suffocating odour,--the odour
of musk. Around each cup was coiled a small, copper-coloured serpent, which gleamed here and
there with golden spots; and directly in front of Muzio, a couple of paces distant from him,
rose up the tall figure of the Malay, clothed in a motley-hued mantle of brocade, girt about
with a tiger's tail, with a tall cap in the form of a horned tiara on his head.

But he was not motionless: now he made devout obeisances and seemed to be praying, again he
drew himself up to his full height, even stood on tiptoe; now he threw his hands apart in broad
and measured sweep, now he waved them urgently in the direction of Muzio, and seemed to be
menacing or commanding with them, as he contracted his brows in a frown and stamped his foot.
All these movements evidently cost him great effort, and even caused him suffering: he breathed
heavily, the sweat streamed from his face. Suddenly he stood stock-still on one spot, and inhaling
the air into his lungs and scowling, he stretched forward, then drew toward him his clenched
fists, as though he were holding reins in them ... and to Fabio's indescribable horror, Muzio's
head slowly separated itself from the back of the chair and reached out after the Malay's hands....
The Malay dropped his hands, and Muzio's head again sank heavily backward; the Malay repeated
his gestures, and the obedient head repeated them after him. The dark liquid in the cups began
to seethe with a faint sound; the very cups themselves emitted a faint tinkling, and the copper
snakes began to move around each of them in undulating motion. Then the Malay advanced a pace,
and elevating his eyebrows very high and opening his eyes until they were of huge size, he
nodded his head at Muzio ... and the eyelids of the corpse began to flutter, parted unevenly,
and from beneath them the pupils, dull as lead, revealed themselves. With proud triumph and
joy--a joy that was almost malicious--beamed the face of the Malay; he opened his lips widely,
and from the very depths of his throat a prolonged roar wrested itself with an effort.... Muzio's
lips parted also, and a faint groan trembled on them in reply to that inhuman sound.

But at this point Fabio could endure it no longer: he fancied that he was witnessing some devilish
incantations! He also uttered a shriek and started off at a run homeward, without looking behind
him,--homeward as fast as he could go, praying and crossing himself as he ran.

XIII

Three hours later Antonio presented himself before him with the report that everything was
ready, all the things were packed, and Signor Muzio was preparing to depart. Without uttering
a word in answer to his servant, Fabio stepped out on the terrace, whence the pavilion was
visible. Several pack-horses were grouped in front of it; at the porch itself a powerful black
stallion, with a roomy saddle adapted for two riders, was drawn up. There also stood the servants
with bared heads and the armed escort. The door of the pavilion opened and, supported by the
Malay, Muzio made his appearance. His face was deathlike, and his arms hung down like those
of a corpse,--but he walked ... yes! he put one foot before the other, and once mounted on
the horse, he held himself upright, and got hold of the reins by fumbling. The Malay thrust
his feet into the stirrups, sprang up behind him on the saddle, encircled his waist with his
arm,--and the whole procession set out. The horses proceeded at a walk, and when they made
the turn in front of the house, Fabio fancied that on Muzio's dark countenance two small white
patches gleamed.... Could it be that he had turned his eyes that way?--The Malay alone saluted
him ... mockingly, but as usual.

Did Valeria see all this? The shutters of her windows were closed ... but perhaps she was standing
behind them.

XIV

At dinner-time she entered the dining-room, and was very quiet and affectionate; but she still
complained of being weary. Yet there was no agitation about her, nor any of her former constant
surprise and secret fear; and when, on the day after Muzio's departure, Fabio again set about
her portrait, he found in her features that pure expression, the temporary eclipse of which
had so disturbed him ... and his brush flew lightly and confidently over the canvas.

Husband and wife began to live their life as of yore. Muzio had vanished for them as though
he had never existed. And both Fabio and Valeria seemed to have entered into a compact not
to recall him by a single sound, not to inquire about his further fate; and it remained a mystery
for all others as well. Muzio really did vanish, as though he had sunk through the earth. One
day Fabio thought himself bound to relate to Valeria precisely what had occurred on that fateful
night ... but she, probably divining his intention, held her breath, and her eyes narrowed
as though she were anticipating a blow.... And Fabio understood her: he did not deal her that blow.

One fine autumnal day Fabio was putting the finishing touches to the picture of his Cecilia;
Valeria was sitting at the organ, and her fingers were wandering over the keys.... Suddenly,
contrary to her own volition, from beneath her fingers rang out that Song of Love Triumphant
which Muzio had once played,--and at that same instant, for the first time since her marriage,
she felt within her the palpitation of a new, germinating life.... Valeria started and stopped
short....

What was the meaning of this? Could it be....

With this word the manuscript came to an end.

CLARA MÍLITCH

A TALE

(1882)

I

In the spring of 1878 there lived in Moscow, in a small wooden house on Shabólovka Street,
a young man five-and-twenty years of age, Yákoff Arátoff by name. With him lived his aunt,
an old maid, over fifty years of age, his father's sister, Platonída Ivánovna. She managed
his housekeeping and took charge of his expenditures, of which Arátoff was utterly incapable.
He had no other relations. Several years before, his father, a petty and not wealthy noble
of the T---- government, had removed to Moscow, together with him and Platonída Ivánovna who,
by the way, was always called Platósha; and her nephew called her so too. When he quitted the
country where all of them had constantly dwelt hitherto, old Arátoff had settled in the capital
with the object of placing his son in the university, for which he had himself prepared him;
he purchased for a trifling sum a small house on one of the remote streets, and installed himself
therein with all his books and "preparations." And of books and preparations he had many, for
he was a man not devoid of learning ... "a supernatural eccentric," according to the words
of his neighbours. He even bore among them the reputation of a magician: he had even received
the nickname of "the insect-observer." He busied himself with chemistry, mineralogy, entomology,
botany, and medicine; he treated voluntary patients with herbs and metallic powders of his
own concoction, after the method of Paracelsus. With those same powders he had sent into the
grave his young, pretty, but already too delicate wife, whom he had passionately loved, and
by whom he had had an only son. With those same metallic powders he had wrought considerable
havoc with the health of his son also, which, on the contrary, he had wished to reinforce,
as he detected in his organisation anæmia and a tendency to consumption inherited from his
mother. The title of "magician" he had acquired, among other things, from the fact that he
considered himself a great-grandson--not in the direct line, of course--of the famous Bruce,
in whose honour he had named his son Yákoff.[51] He was the sort of man who is called "very
good-natured," but of a melancholy temperament, fussy, and timid, with a predilection for everything
that was mysterious or mystical.... "Ah!" uttered in a half-whisper was his customary exclamation;
and he died with that exclamation on his lips, two years after his removal to Moscow.

His son Yákoff did not, in outward appearance, resemble his father, who had been homely in
person, clumsy and awkward; he reminded one rather of his mother. There were the same delicate,
pretty features, the same soft hair of ashblonde hue, the same plump, childish lips, and large,
languishing, greenish-grey eyes, and feathery eyelashes. On the other hand in disposition he
resembled his father; and his face, which did not resemble his father's, bore the stamp of
his father's expression; and he had angular arms, and a sunken chest, like old Arátoff, who,
by the way, should hardly be called an old man, since he did not last to the age of fifty.
During the latter's lifetime Yákoff had already entered the university, in the physico-mathematical
faculty; but he did not finish his course,--not out of idleness, but because, according to
his ideas, a person can learn no more in the university than he can teach himself at home;
and he did not aspire to a diploma, as he was not intending to enter the government service.
He avoided his comrades, made acquaintance with hardly any one, was especially shy of women,
and lived a very isolated life, immersed in his books. He was shy of women, although he had
a very tender heart, and was captivated by beauty.... He even acquired the luxury of an English
keepsake, and (Oh, for shame!) admired the portraits of divers, bewitching Gulnares and Medoras
which "adorned" it.... But his inborn modesty constantly restrained him. At home he occupied
his late father's study, which had also been his bedroom; and his bed was the same on which
his father had died.

The great support of his whole existence, his unfailing comrade and friend, was his aunt, that
Platósha, with whom he exchanged barely ten words a day, but without whom he could not take
a step. She was a long-visaged, long-toothed being, with pale eyes in a pale face, and an unvarying
expression partly of sadness, partly of anxious alarm. Eternally attired in a grey gown, and
a grey shawl which was redolent of camphor, she wandered about the house like a shadow, with
noiseless footsteps; she sighed, whispered prayers--especially one, her favourite, which consisted
of two words: "Lord, help!"--and managed the housekeeping very vigorously, hoarding every kopék
and buying everything herself. She worshipped her nephew; she was constantly fretting about
his health, was constantly in a state of alarm, not about herself but about him, and as soon
as she thought there was anything the matter with him, she would quietly approach and place
on his writing-table a cup of herb-tea, or stroke his back with her hands, which were as soft
as wadding.

This coddling did not annoy Yákoff, but he did not drink the herb-tea, and only nodded approvingly.
But neither could he boast of his health. He was extremely sensitive, nervous, suspicious;
he suffered from palpitation of the heart, and sometimes from asthma. Like his father, he believed
that there existed in nature and in the soul of man secrets, of which glimpses may sometimes
be caught, though they cannot be understood; he believed in the presence of certain forces
and influences, sometimes well-disposed but more frequently hostile ... and he also believed
in science,--in its dignity and worth. Of late he had conceived a passion for photography.
The odour of the ingredients used in that connection greatly disturbed his old aunt,--again
not on her own behalf, but for Yásha's sake, on account of his chest. But with all his gentleness
of disposition he possessed no small portion of stubbornness, and he diligently pursued his
favourite occupation. "Platósha" submitted, and merely sighed more frequently than ever, and
whispered "Lord, help!" as she gazed at his fingers stained with iodine.

Yákoff, as has already been stated, shunned his comrades; but with one of them he struck up
a rather close friendship, and saw him frequently, even after that comrade, on leaving the
university, entered the government service, which, however, was not very exacting: to use his
own words, he had "tacked himself on" to the building of the Church of the Saviour[52] without,
of course, knowing anything whatever about architecture. Strange to say, that solitary friend
of Arátoff's, Kupfer by name, a German who was Russified to the extent of not knowing a single
word of German, and even used the epithet "German"[53] as a term of opprobrium,--that friend
had, to all appearance, nothing in common with him. He was a jolly, rosy-cheeked young fellow
with black, curly hair, loquacious, and very fond of that feminine society which Arátoff so
shunned. Truth to tell, Kupfer breakfasted and dined with him rather often, and even--as he
was not a rich man--borrowed small sums of money from him; but it was not that which made the
free-and-easy German so diligently frequent the little house on Shabólovka Street. He had taken
a liking to Yákoff's spiritual purity, his "ideality,"--possibly as a contrast to what he daily
encountered and beheld;--or, perhaps, in that same attraction toward "ideality" the young man's
German blood revealed itself. And Yákoff liked Kupfer's good-natured frankness; and in addition
to this, his tales of the theatres, concerts, and balls which he constantly attended--in general
of that alien world into which Yákoff could not bring himself to penetrate--secretly interested
and even excited the young recluse, yet without arousing in him a desire to test all this in
his own experience. And Platósha liked Kupfer; she sometimes thought him too unceremonious,
it is true; but instinctively feeling and understanding that he was sincerely attached to her
beloved Yásha, she not only tolerated the noisy visitor, but even felt a kindness for him.

II

At the time of which we are speaking, there was in Moscow a certain widow, a Georgian Princess,--a
person of ill-defined standing and almost a suspicious character. She was about forty years
of age; in her youth she had, probably, bloomed with that peculiar oriental beauty, which so
quickly fades; now she powdered and painted herself, and dyed her hair a yellow hue. Various,
not altogether favourable, and not quite definite, rumours were in circulation about her; no
one had known her husband--and in no one city had she lived for any length of time. She had
neither children nor property; but she lived on a lavish scale,--on credit or otherwise. She
held a salon, as the saying is, and received a decidedly mixed company--chiefly composed of
young men. Her whole establishment, beginning with her own toilette, furniture, and table,
and ending with her equipage and staff of servants, bore a certain stamp of inferiority, artificiality,
transitoriness ... but neither the Princess herself nor her guests, apparently, demanded anything
better. The Princess was reputed to be fond of music and literature, to be a patroness of actors
and artists; and she really did take an interest in these "questions," even to an enthusiastic
degree--and even to a pitch of rapture which was not altogether simulated. She indubitably
did possess the æsthetic chord. Moreover, she was very accessible, amiable, devoid of pretensions,
of affectation, and--a fact which many did not suspect--in reality extremely kind, tender-hearted
and obliging.... Rare qualities, and therefore all the more precious, precisely in individuals
of that stamp.

"A frivolous woman!" one clever person said concerning her, "and she will infallibly get into
paradise! For she forgives everything--and everything will be forgiven her!"--It was also said
concerning her that when she disappeared from any town, she always left behind her as many
creditors as persons whom she had loaded with benefits. A soft heart can be pressed in any
direction you like.

Kupfer, as was to be expected, was a visitor at her house, and became very intimate with her
... altogether too intimate, so malicious tongues asserted. But he always spoke of her not
only in a friendly manner, but also with respect; he lauded her as a woman of gold--interpret
that as you please!--and was a firm believer in her love for art, and in her comprehension
of art!--So then, one day after dinner, at the Arátoffs', after having discussed the Princess
and her evening gatherings, he began to urge Yákoff to break in upon his life of an anchorite
for once, and permit him, Kupfer, to introduce him to his friend. At first Yákoff would not
hear to anything of the sort.

"Why, what idea hast thou got into thy head?" exclaimed Kupfer at last. "What sort of a presentation
is in question? I shall simply take thee, just as thou art now sitting there, in thy frock-coat,
and conduct thee to her evening. They do not stand on ceremony in the least there, brother!
Here now, thou art learned, and thou art fond of music" (there actually was in Arátoff's study
a small piano, on which he occasionally struck a few chords in diminished sevenths)--"and in
her house there is any quantity of that sort of thing!... And there thou wilt meet sympathetic
people, without any airs! And, in conclusion, it is not right that at thy age, with thy personal
appearance" (Arátoff dropped his eyes and waved his hand)--"yes, yes, with thy personal appearance,
thou shouldst shun society, the world, in this manner! I'm not going to take thee to call on
generals, seest thou! Moreover, I don't know any generals myself!... Don't be stubborn, my
dear fellow! Morality is a good thing, a thing worthy of respect.... But why give thyself up
to asceticism? Assuredly, thou art not preparing to become a monk!"

Arátoff continued, nevertheless, to resist; but Platonída Ivánovna unexpectedly came to Kupfer's
assistance. Although she did not quite understand the meaning of the word "asceticism," still
she also thought that it would not be a bad idea for Yáshenka to divert himself, to take a
look at people,--and show himself.--"The more so," she added, "that I have confidence in Feódor
Feódoritch! He will not take thee to any bad place!..."

"I'll restore him to thee in all his pristine purity!" cried Kupfer, at whom Platonída Ivánovna,
in spite of her confidence, kept casting uneasy glances; Arátoff blushed to his very ears--but
he ceased to object.

It ended in Kupfer taking him, on the following day, to the Princess's evening assembly. But
Arátoff did not remain there long. In the first place, he found at her house about twenty guests,
men and women, who were, presumably, sympathetic, but who were strangers to him, nevertheless;
and this embarrassed him, although he was obliged to talk very little: but he feared this most
of all. In the second place, he did not like the hostess herself, although she welcomed him
very cordially and unaffectedly. Everything about her displeased him; her painted face, and
her churned-up curls, and her hoarsely-mellifluous voice, her shrill laugh, her way of rolling
up her eyes, her too décolleté bodice--and those plump, shiny fingers with a multitude of rings!...
Slinking off into a corner, he now swiftly ran his eyes over the faces of all the guests, as
though he did not even distinguish one from another; again he stared persistently at his own
feet. But when, at last, an artist who had just come to town, with a drink-sodden countenance,
extremely long hair, and a bit of glass under his puckered brow, seated himself at the piano,
and bringing down his hands on the keys and his feet on the pedals, with a flourish, began
to bang out a fantasia by Liszt on a Wagnerian theme, Arátoff could stand it no longer, and
slipped away, bearing in his soul a confused and oppressive impression, athwart which, nevertheless,
there pierced something which he did not understand, but which was significant and even agitating.

III

Kupfer came on the following day to dinner; but he did not enlarge upon the preceding evening,
he did not even reproach Arátoff for his hasty flight, and merely expressed regret that he
had not waited for supper, at which champagne had been served! (of Nízhegorod[54] fabrication,
we may remark in parenthesis).

Kupfer probably understood that he had made a mistake in trying to rouse his friend, and that
Arátoff was a man who positively was not adapted to that sort of society and manner of life.
On his side, Arátoff also did not allude to the Princess or to the night before. Platonída
Ivánovna did not know whether to rejoice at the failure of this first attempt or to regret
it. She decided, at last, that Yásha's health might suffer from such expeditions, and regained
her complacency. Kupfer went away directly after dinner, and did not show himself again for
a whole week. And that not because he was sulking at Arátoff for the failure of his introduction,--the
good-natured fellow was incapable of such a thing,--but he had, evidently, found some occupation
which engrossed all his time, all his thoughts;--for thereafter he rarely came to the Arátoffs',
wore an abstracted aspect, and soon vanished.... Arátoff continued to live on as before; but
some hitch, if we may so express ourselves, had secured lodgment in his soul. He still recalled
something or other, without himself being quite aware what it was precisely,--and that "something"
referred to the evening which he had spent at the Princess's house. Nevertheless, he had not
the slightest desire to return to it; and society, a section of which he had inspected in her
house, repelled him more than ever. Thus passed six weeks.

And lo! one morning, Kupfer again presented himself to him, this time with a somewhat embarrassed
visage.

"I know," he began, with a forced laugh, "that thy visit that evening was not to thy taste;
but I hope that thou wilt consent to my proposal nevertheless ... and wilt not refuse my request."

"What art thou talking about?" inquired Arátoff.

"See here," pursued Kupfer, becoming more and more animated; "there exists here a certain society
of amateurs and artists, which from time to time organises readings, concerts, even theatrical
representations, for philanthropic objects...."

"And the Princess takes part?" interrupted Arátoff.

"The Princess always takes part in good works--but that is of no consequence. We have got up
a literary and musical morning ... and at that performance thou mayest hear a young girl ...
a remarkable young girl!--We do not quite know, as yet, whether she will turn out a Rachel
or a Viardot ... for she sings splendidly, and declaims and acts.... She has talent of the
first class, my dear fellow! I am not exaggerating.--So here now ... wilt not thou take a ticket?--Five
rubles if thou wishest the first row."

"And where did this wonderful young girl come from?" asked Arátoff.

Kupfer grinned.--"That I cannot say.... Of late she has found an asylum with the Princess.
The Princess, as thou knowest, is a patron of all such people.... And it is probable that thou
sawest her that evening."

Arátoff started inwardly, faintly ... but made no answer.

"She has even acted somewhere in country districts," went on Kupfer, "and, on the whole, she
was created for the theatre. Thou shalt see for thyself!"

"Is her name Clara?" asked Arátoff.

"Yes, Clara...."

"Clara!" interrupted Arátoff again.--"It cannot be!"

"Why not?--Clara it is, ... Clara Mílitch; that is not her real name ... but that is what she
is called. She is to sing a romance by Glinka ... and one by Tchaikóvsky, and then she will
recite the letter from 'Evgény Onyégin'[55]--Come now! Wilt thou take a ticket?"

"But when is it to be?"

"To-morrow ... to-morrow, at half-past one, in a private hall, on Ostozhyónka Street.... I
will come for thee. A ticket at five rubles?... Here it is.... No, this is a three-ruble ticket.--Here
it is.--And here is the affiche.[56]--I am one of the managers."

Arátoff reflected. Platonída Ivánovna entered the room at that moment and, glancing at his
face, was suddenly seized with agitation.--"Yásha," she exclaimed, "what ails thee? Why art
thou so excited? Feódor Feódorovitch, what hast thou been saying to him?"

But Arátoff did not give his friend a chance to answer his aunt's question, and hastily seizing
the ticket which was held out to him, he ordered Platonída Ivánovna to give Kupfer five rubles
on the instant.

She was amazed, and began to blink her eyes.... Nevertheless, she handed Kupfer the money in
silence. Yáshenka had shouted at her in a very severe manner.

"She's a marvel of marvels, I tell thee!" cried Kupfer, darting toward the door.--"Expect me
to-morrow!"

"Has she black eyes?" called Arátoff after him.

"As black as coal!" merrily roared Kupfer, and disappeared.

Arátoff went off to his own room, while Platonída Ivánovna remained rooted to the spot, repeating:
"Help, Lord! Lord, help!"

IV

The large hall in a private house on Ostozhyónka Street was already half filled with spectators
when Arátoff and Kupfer arrived. Theatrical representations were sometimes given in that hall,
but on this occasion neither stage-scenery nor curtain were visible. Those who had organised
the "morning" had confined themselves to erecting a platform at one end, placing thereon a
piano and a couple of music-racks, a few chairs, a table with a carafe of water and a glass,
and hanging a curtain of red cloth over the door which led to the room set apart for the artists.
In the first row the Princess was already seated, clad in a bright green gown; Arátoff placed
himself at some distance from her, after barely exchanging a bow with her. The audience was
what is called motley; it consisted chiefly of young men from various institutions of learning.
Kupfer, in his quality of a manager, with a white ribbon on the lapel of his dress-coat, bustled
and fussed about with all his might; the Princess was visibly excited, kept looking about her,
launching smiles in all directions, and chatting with her neighbours ... there were only men
in her immediate vicinity.

The first to make his appearance on the platform was a flute-player of consumptive aspect,
who spat out ... that is to say, piped out a piece which was consumptive like himself. Two
persons shouted "Bravo!" Then a fat gentleman in spectacles, very sedate and even grim of aspect,
recited in a bass voice a sketch by Shtchedrín;[57] the audience applauded the sketch, not
him.--Then the pianist, who was already known to Arátoff, presented himself, and pounded out
the same Liszt fantasia; the pianist was favoured with a recall. He bowed, with his hand resting
on the back of a chair, and after each bow he tossed back his hair exactly like Liszt! At last,
after a decidedly long intermission, the red cloth over the door at the rear of the platform
moved, was drawn widely apart, and Clara Mílitch made her appearance. The hall rang with applause.
With unsteady steps she approached the front of the platform, came to a halt, and stood motionless,
with her large, red, ungloved hands crossed in front of her, making no curtsey, neither bending
her head nor smiling.

She was a girl of nineteen, tall, rather broad-shouldered, but well built. Her face was swarthy,
partly Hebrew, partly Gipsy in type; her eyes were small and black beneath thick brows which
almost met, her nose was straight, slightly up-turned, her lips were thin with a beautiful
but sharp curve; she had a huge braid of black hair, which was heavy even to the eye, a low,
impassive, stony brow, tiny ears ... her whole countenance was thoughtful, almost surly. A
passionate, self-willed nature,--not likely to be either kindly or even intelligent,--but gifted,
was manifested by everything about her.

For a while she did not raise her eyes, but suddenly gave a start and sent her intent but not
attentive glance, which seemed to be buried in herself, along the rows of spectators.

"What tragic eyes!" remarked a certain grey-haired fop, who sat behind Arátoff, with the face
of a courtesan from Revel,--one of Moscow's well-known first-nighters and rounders. The fop
was stupid and intended to utter a bit of nonsense ... but he had spoken the truth! Arátoff,
who had never taken his eyes from Clara since she had made her appearance, only then recalled
that he actually had seen her at the Princess's; and had not only seen her, but had even noticed
that she had several times looked at him with particular intentness out of her dark, watchful
eyes. And on this occasion also ... or did he merely fancy that it was so?--on catching sight
of him in the first row, she seemed to be delighted, seemed to blush--and again she gazed intently
at him. Then, without turning round, she retreated a couple of paces in the direction of the
piano, at which the accompanist, the long-haired foreigner, was already seated. She was to
execute Glinka's romance, "As soon as I recognised thee...." She immediately began to sing,
without altering the position of her hands and without glancing at the notes. Her voice was
soft and resonant,--a contralto,--she pronounced her words distinctly and forcibly, and sang
monotonously, without shading but with strong expression.

"The lass sings with conviction," remarked the same fop who sat behind Arátoff,--and again
he spoke the truth.

Shouts of "Bis!" "Bravo!" resounded all about, but she merely darted a swift glance at Arátoff,
who was neither shouting nor clapping,--he had not been particularly pleased by her singing,--made
a slight bow and withdrew, without taking the arm of the hairy pianist which he had crooked
out like a cracknel. She was recalled ... but it was some time before she made her appearance,
advanced to the piano with the same uncertain tread as before, and after whispering a couple
of words to her accompanist, who was obliged to get and place on the rack before him not the
music he had prepared but something else,--she began Tchaikóvsky's romance: "No, only he who
hath felt the thirst of meeting".... This romance she sang in a different way from the first--in
an undertone, as though she were weary ... and only in the line before the last, "He will understand
how I have suffered,"--did a ringing, burning cry burst from her. The last line, "And how I
suffer...." she almost whispered, sadly prolonging the final word. This romance produced a
slighter impression on the audience than Glinka's; but there was a great deal of applause....
Kupfer, in particular, distinguished himself: he brought his hands together in a peculiar manner,
in the form of a cask, when he clapped, thereby producing a remarkably sonorous noise. The
Princess gave him a large, dishevelled bouquet, which he was to present to the songstress;
but the latter did not appear to perceive Kupfer's bowed figure, and his hand outstretched
with the bouquet, and she turned and withdrew, again without waiting for the pianist, who had
sprung to his feet with still greater alacrity than before to escort her, and who, being thus
left in the lurch, shook his hair as Liszt himself, in all probability, never shook his!

During the whole time she was singing Arátoff had been scanning Clara's face. It seemed to
him that her eyes, athwart her contracted lashes, were again turned on him. But he was particularly
struck by the impassiveness of that face, that forehead, those brows, and only when she uttered
her passionate cry did he notice a row of white, closely-set teeth gleaming warmly from between
her barely parted lips. Kupfer stepped up to him.

"Well, brother, what dost thou think of her?" he asked, all beaming with satisfaction.

"She has a fine voice," replied Arátoff, "but she does not know how to sing yet, she has had
no real school." (Why he said this and what he meant by "school" the Lord only knows!)

Kupfer was surprised.--"She has no school," he repeated slowly.... "Well, now.... She can still
study. But on the other hand, what soul! But just wait until thou hast heard her recite Tatyána's
letter."

He ran away from Arátoff, and the latter thought: "Soul! With that impassive face!"--He thought
that she bore herself and moved like a hypnotised person, like a somnambulist.... And, at the
same time, she was indubitably.... Yes! she was indubitably staring at him.

Meanwhile the "morning" went on. The fat man in spectacles presented himself again; despite
his serious appearance he imagined that he was a comic artist and read a scene from Gógol,
this time without evoking a single token of approbation. The flute-player flitted past once
more; again the pianist thundered; a young fellow of twenty, pomaded and curled, but with traces
of tears on his cheeks, sawed out some variations on his fiddle. It might have appeared strange
that in the intervals between the recitations and the music the abrupt notes of a French horn
were wafted, now and then, from the artists' room; but this instrument was not used, nevertheless.
It afterward came out that the amateur who had offered to perform on it had been seized with
a panic at the moment when he should have made his appearance before the audience. So at last,
Clara Mílitch appeared again.

She held in her hand a small volume of Púshkin; but during her reading she never once glanced
at it.... She was obviously frightened; the little book shook slightly in her fingers. Arátoff
also observed the expression of dejection which now overspread her stern features. The first
line: "I write to you ... what would you more?" she uttered with extreme simplicity, almost
ingenuously,--stretching both arms out in front of her with an ingenuous, sincere, helpless
gesture. Then she began to hurry a little; but beginning with the line: "Another! Nay! to none
on earth could I have given e'er my heart!" she regained her self-possession, and grew animated;
and when she reached the words: "All, all life hath been a pledge of faithful meeting thus
with thee,"--her hitherto rather dull voice rang out enthusiastically and boldly, and her eyes
riveted themselves on Arátoff with a boldness and directness to match. She went on with the
same enthusiasm, and only toward the close did her voice again fall, and in it and in her face
her previous dejection was again depicted. She made a complete muddle, as the saying is, of
the last four lines,--the little volume of Púshkin suddenly slipped from her hands, and she
beat a hasty retreat.

The audience set to applauding and recalling her in desperate fashion.... One theological student,--a
Little Russian,--among others, bellowed so loudly: "Muíluitch! Muíluitch!"[58] that his neighbour
politely and sympathetically begged him to "spare himself, as a future proto-deacon!"[59] But
Arátoff immediately rose and betook himself to the entrance. Kupfer overtook him....

"Good gracious, whither art thou going?" he yelled:--"I'll introduce thee to Clara if thou
wishest--shall I?"

"No, thanks," hastily replied Arátoff, and set off homeward almost at a run.

V

Strange emotions, which were not clear even to himself, agitated him. In reality, Clara's recitation
had not altogether pleased him either ... altogether he could not tell precisely why. It had
troubled him, that recitation, it had seemed to him harsh, unmelodious.... Somehow it seemed
to have broken something within him, to have exerted some sort of violence. And those importunate,
persistent, almost insolent glances--what had caused them? What did they signify?

Arátoff's modesty did permit him even a momentary thought that he might have pleased that strange
young girl, that he might have inspired her with a sentiment akin to love, to passion!... And
he had imagined to himself quite otherwise that as yet unknown woman, that young girl, to whom
he would surrender himself wholly, and who would love him, become his bride, his wife.... He
rarely dreamed of this: he was chaste both in body and soul;--but the pure image which rose
up in his imagination at such times was evoked under another form,--the form of his dead mother,
whom he barely remembered, though he cherished her portrait like a sacred treasure. That portrait
had been painted in water-colours, in a rather inartistic manner, by a friendly neighbour,
but the likeness was striking, as every one averred. The woman, the young girl, whom as yet
he did not so much as venture to expect, must possess just such a tender profile, just such
kind, bright eyes, just such silky hair, just such a smile, just such a clear understanding....

But this was a black-visaged, swarthy creature, with coarse hair, and a moustache on her lip;
she must certainly be bad-tempered, giddy.... "A gipsy" (Arátoff could not devise a worse expression)--what
was she to him?

And in the meantime, Arátoff was unable to banish from his mind that black-visaged gipsy, whose
singing and recitation and even whose personal appearance were disagreeable to him. He was
perplexed, he was angry with himself. Not long before this he had read Walter Scott's romance
"Saint Ronan's Well" (there was a complete edition of Walter Scott's works in the library of
his father, who revered the English romance-writer as a serious, almost a learned author).
The heroine of that romance is named Clara Mowbray. A poet of the '40's, Krásoff, wrote a poem
about her, which wound up with the words:

    "Unhappy Clara! foolish Clara!
    Unhappy Clara Mowbray!"

Arátoff was acquainted with this poem also.... And now these words kept incessantly recurring
to his memory.... "Unhappy Clara! foolish Clara!..." (That was why he had been so surprised
when Kupfer mentioned Clara Mílitch to him.) Even Platósha noticed, not precisely a change
in Yákoff's frame of mind--as a matter of fact, no change had taken place--but something wrong
about his looks, in his remarks. She cautiously interrogated him about the literary morning
at which he had been present;--she whispered, sighed, scrutinised him from in front, scrutinised
him from the side, from behind--and suddenly, slapping her hands on her thighs, she exclaimed:

"Well, Yáshal--I see what the trouble is!"

"What dost thou mean?" queried Arátoff in his turn.

"Thou hast certainly met at that morning some one of those tail-draggers" (that was what Platonída
Ivánovna called all ladies who wore fashionable gowns).... "She has a comely face--and she
puts on airs like this,--and twists her face like this" (Platósha depicted all this in her
face), "and she makes her eyes go round like this...." (she mimicked this also, describing
huge circles in the air with her forefinger).... "And it made an impression on thee, because
thou art not used to it.... But that does not signify anything, Yásha ... it does not signify
anything! Drink a cup of herb-tea when thou goest to bed, and that will be the end of it!...
Lord, help!"

Platósha ceased speaking and took herself off.... She probably had never made such a long and
animated speech before since she was born ... but Arátoff thought:

"I do believe my aunt is right.... It is all because I am not used to such things...." (He
really had attracted the attention of the female sex to himself for the first time ... at any
rate, he had never noticed it before.) "I must not indulge myself."

So he set to work at his books, and drank some linden-flower tea when he went to bed, and even
slept well all that night, and had no dreams. On the following morning he busied himself with
his photography, as though nothing had happened....

But toward evening his spiritual serenity was again disturbed.

VI

To wit: a messenger brought him a note, written in a large, irregular feminine hand, which
ran as follows:

"If you guess who is writing to you, and if it does not bore you, come to-morrow, after dinner,
to the Tver boulevard--about five o'clock--and wait. You will not be detained long. But it
is very important. Come."

There was no signature. Arátoff instantly divined who his correspondent was, and that was precisely
what disturbed him.--"What nonsense!" he said, almost aloud. "This is too much! Of course I
shall not go."--Nevertheless, he ordered the messenger to be summoned, and from him he learned
merely that the letter had been handed to him on the street by a maid. Having dismissed him,
Arátoff reread the letter, and flung it on the floor.... But after a while he picked it up
and read it over again; a second time he cried: "Nonsense!" He did not throw the letter on
the floor this time, however, but put it away in a drawer.

Arátoff went about his customary avocations, busying himself now with one, now with another;
but his work did not make progress, was not a success. Suddenly he noticed that he was waiting
for Kupfer, that he wanted to interrogate him, or even communicate something to him.... But
Kupfer did not make his appearance. Then Arátoff got Púshkin and read Tatyána's letter and
again felt convinced that that "gipsy" had not in the least grasped the meaning of the letter.
But there was that jester Kupfer shouting: "A Rachel! A Viardot!" Then he went to his piano,
raised the cover in an abstracted sort of way, tried to search out in his memory the melody
of Tchaikóvsky's romance; but he immediately banged to the piano-lid with vexation and went
to his aunt, in her own room, which was always kept very hot, and was forever redolent of mint,
sage, and other medicinal herbs, and crowded with such a multitude of rugs, étagères, little
benches, cushions and various articles of softly-stuffed furniture that it was difficult for
an inexperienced person to turn round in it, and breathing was oppressive. Platonída Ivánovna
was sitting by the window with her knitting-needles in her hand (she was knitting a scarf for
Yáshenka--the thirty-eighth, by actual count, during the course of his existence!)--and was
greatly surprised. Arátoff rarely entered her room, and if he needed anything he always shouted
in a shrill voice from his study: "Aunt Platósha!"--But she made him sit down and, in anticipation
of his first words, pricked up her ears, as she stared at him through her round spectacles
with one eye, and above them with the other. She did not inquire after his health, and did
not offer him tea, for she saw that he had not come for that. Arátoff hesitated for a while
... then began to talk ... to talk about his mother, about the way she had lived with his father,
and how his father had made her acquaintance. He knew all this perfectly well ... but he wanted
to talk precisely about that. Unluckily for him, Platósha did not know how to converse in the
least; she made very brief replies, as though she suspected that Yásha had not come for that
purpose.

"Certainly!"--she kept repeating hurriedly, as she plied her knitting-needles almost in an
angry way. "Every one knows that thy mother was a dove ... a regular dove.... And thy father
loved her as a husband should love, faithfully and honourably, to the very grave; and he never
loved any other woman,"--she added, elevating her voice and removing her spectacles.

"And was she of a timid disposition?" asked Arátoff, after a short pause.

"Certainly she was. As is fitting for the female sex. The bold ones are a recent invention."

"And were there no bold ones in your time?"

"There were such even in our day ... of course there were! But who were they? Some street-walker,
or shameless hussy or other. She would drag her skirts about, and fling herself hither and
thither at random.... What did she care? What anxiety had she? If a young fool came along,
he fell into her hands. But steady-going people despised them. Dost thou remember ever to have
beheld such in our house?"

Arátoff made no reply and returned to his study. Platonída Ivánovna gazed after him, shook
her head and again donned her spectacles, again set to work on her scarf ... but more than
once she fell into thought and dropped her knitting-needles on her knee.

And Arátoff until nightfall kept again and again beginning, with the same vexation, the same
ire as before, to think about "the gipsy," the appointed tryst, to which he certainly would
not go! During the night also she worried him. He kept constantly seeing her eyes, now narrowed,
now widely opened, with their importunate gaze riveted directly on him, and those impassive
features with their imperious expression.

On the following morning he again kept expecting Kupfer, for some reason or other; he came
near writing him a letter ... however, he did nothing ... but spent most of his time pacing
to and fro in his study. Not for one instant did he even admit to himself the thought that
he would go to that stupid "rendezvous" ... and at half-past four, after having swallowed his
dinner in haste, he suddenly donned his overcoat and pulling his cap down on his brows, he
stole out of the house without letting his aunt see him and wended his way to the Tver boulevard.

VII

Arátoff found few pedestrians on the boulevard. The weather was raw and quite cold. He strove
not to think of what he was doing. He forced himself to turn his attention to all the objects
he came across and pretended to assure himself that he had come out to walk precisely like
the other people.... The letter of the day before was in his side-pocket, and he was uninterruptedly
conscious of its presence. He walked the length of the boulevard a couple of times, darting
keen glances at every feminine form which approached him, and his heart thumped, thumped violently....
He began to feel tired, and sat down on a bench. And suddenly the idea occurred to him: "Come
now, what if that letter was not written by her but by some one else, by some other woman?"
In point of fact, that should have made no difference to him ... and yet he was forced to admit
to himself that he did not wish this. "It would be very stupid," he thought, "still more stupid
than that!" A nervous restlessness began to take possession of him; he began to feel chilly,
not outwardly but inwardly. Several times he drew out his watch from his waistcoat pocket,
glanced at the face, put it back again,--and every time forgot how many minutes were lacking
to five o'clock. It seemed to him as though every one who passed him stared at him in a peculiar
manner, surveying him with a certain sneering surprise and curiosity. A wretched little dog
ran up, sniffed at his legs and began to wag its tail. He flourished his arms angrily at it.
He was most annoyed of all by a small boy from a factory in a bed-ticking jacket, who seated
himself on the bench and first whistled, then scratched his head, dangling his legs, encased
in huge, broken boots, the while, and staring at him from time to time. "His employer is certainly
expecting him," thought Arátoff, "and here he is, the lazy dog, wasting his time idling about...."

But at that same moment it seemed to him as though some one had approached and taken up a stand
close behind him ... a warm current emanated thence....

He glanced round.... It was she!

He recognised her immediately, although a thick, dark-blue veil concealed her features. He
instantly sprang from the bench, and remained standing there, unable to utter a word. She also
maintained silence. He felt greatly agitated ... but her agitation was as great as his: Arátoff
could not help seeing even through the veil how deadly pale she grew. But she was the first
to speak.

"Thank you," she began in a broken voice, "thank you for coming. I did not hope...." She turned
away slightly and walked along the boulevard. Arátoff followed her.

"Perhaps you condemn me," she went on, without turning her head.--"As a matter of fact, my
action is very strange.... But I have heard a great deal about you ... but no! I ... that was
not the cause.... If you only knew.... I wanted to say so much to you, my God!... But how am
I to do it?... How am I to do it!"

Arátoff walked by her side, but a little in the rear. He did not see her face; he saw only
her hat and a part of her veil ... and her long, threadbare cloak. All his vexation against
her and against himself suddenly returned to him; all the absurdity, all the awkwardness of
this tryst, of these explanations between utter strangers, on a public boulevard, suddenly
presented itself to him.

"I have come hither at your behest," he began in his turn, "I have come, my dear madame" (her
shoulders quivered softly, she turned into a side path, and he followed her), "merely for the
sake of having an explanation, of learning in consequence of what strange misunderstanding
you were pleased to appeal to me, a stranger to you, who ... who only guessed, as you expressed
it in your letter, that it was precisely you who had written to him ... because he guessed
that you had tried, in the course of that literary morning to show him too much ... too much
obvious attention."

Arátoff uttered the whole of this little speech in the same resonant but firm voice in which
men who are still very young answer at examinations on questions for which they are well prepared....
He was indignant; he was angry.... And that wrath had loosed his tongue which was not very
fluent on ordinary occasions.

She continued to advance along the path with somewhat lagging steps.... Arátoff followed her
as before, and as before saw only her little old mantilla and her small hat, which was not
quite new either. His vanity suffered at the thought that she must now be thinking: "All I
had to do was to make a sign, and he immediately hastened to me!"

Arátoff lapsed into silence ... he expected that she would reply to him; but she did not utter
a word.

"I am ready to listen to you," he began again, "and I shall even be very glad if I can be of
service to you in any way ... although, I must confess, nevertheless, that I find it astonishing
... that considering my isolated life...."

But at his last words Clara suddenly turned to him and he beheld the same startled, profoundly-sorrowful
visage, with the same large, bright tears in its eyes, with the same woful expression around
the parted lips; and the visage was so fine thus that he involuntarily broke off short and
felt within himself something akin to fright, and pity and forbearance.

"Akh, why ... why are you like this? ..." she said with irresistibly sincere and upright force--and
what a touching ring there was to her voice!--"Is it possible that my appeal to you can have
offended you?... Is it possible that you have understood nothing?... Ah, yes! You have not
understood anything, you have not understood what I said to you. God knows what you have imagined
about me, you have not even reflected what it cost me to write to you!... You have been anxious
only on your own account, about your own dignity, your own peace!... But did I...." (she so
tightly clenched her hands which she had raised to her lips that her fingers cracked audibly)....
"As though I had made any demands upon you, as though explanations were requisite to begin
with.... 'My dear madame'.... 'I even find it astonishing'.... 'If I can be of service to you'....
Akh, how foolish I have been!--I have been deceived in you, in your face!... When I saw you
for the first time.... There.... There you stand.... And not one word do you utter! Have you
really not a word to say?"

She had been imploring.... Her face suddenly flushed, and as suddenly assumed an evil and audacious
expression,--"O Lord! how stupid this is!"--she cried suddenly, with a harsh laugh.--"How stupid
our tryst is! How stupid I am! ... and you, too!... Fie!"

She made a disdainful gesture with her hand as though sweeping him out of her path, and passing
around him she ran swiftly from the boulevard and disappeared.

That gesture of the hand, that insulting laugh, that final exclamation instantly restored Arátoff
to his former frame of mind and stifled in him the feeling which had risen in his soul when
she turned to him with tears in her eyes. Again he waxed wroth, and came near shouting after
the retreating girl: "You may turn out a good actress, but why have you taken it into your
head to play a comedy on me?"

With great strides he returned home, and although he continued to be indignant and to rage
all the way thither, still, at the same time, athwart all these evil, hostile feelings there
forced its way the memory of that wondrous face which he had beheld only for the twinkling
of an eye.... He even put to himself the question: "Why did not I answer her when she demanded
from me at least one word?"--"I did not have time," ... he thought.... "She did not give me
a chance to utter that word.... And what would I have uttered?"

But he immediately shook his head and said, "An actress!"

And yet, at the same time, the vanity of the inexperienced, nervous youth, which had been wounded
at first, now felt rather flattered at the passion which he had inspired....

"But on the other hand," he pursued his reflections, "all that is at an end of course.... I
must have appeared ridiculous to her."....

This thought was disagreeable to him, and again he grew angry ... both at her ... and at himself.
On reaching home he locked himself in his study. He did not wish to encounter Platósha. The
kind old woman came to his door a couple of times, applied her ear to the key-hole, and merely
sighed and whispered her prayer....

"It has begun!" she thought.... "And he is only five-and-twenty.... Akh, it is early, early!"

VIII

Akátoff was very much out of sorts all the following day.

"What is the matter, Yásha?" Platonída Ivánovna said to him. "Thou seemest to be tousled to-day,
somehow."... In the old woman's peculiar language this quite accurately defined Arátoff's moral
condition. He could not work, but even he himself did not know what he wanted. Now he was expecting
Kupfer again (he suspected that it was precisely from Kupfer that Clara had obtained his address
... and who else could have "talked a great deal" about him?); again he wondered whether his
acquaintance with her was to end in that way? ... again he imagined that she would write him
another letter; again he asked himself whether he ought not to write her a letter, in which
he might explain everything to her,---as he did not wish to leave an unpleasant impression
of himself.... But, in point of fact, what was he to explain?--Now he aroused in himself something
very like disgust for her, for her persistence, her boldness; again that indescribably touching
face presented itself to him and her irresistible voice made itself heard; and yet again he
recalled her singing, her recitation--and did not know whether he was right in his wholesale
condemnation.--In one word: he was a tousled man! At last he became bored with all this and
decided, as the saying is, "to take it upon himself" and erase all that affair, as it undoubtedly
was interfering with his avocations and disturbing his peace of mind.--He did not find it so
easy to put his resolution into effect.... More than a week elapsed before he got back again
into his ordinary rut. Fortunately, Kupfer did not present himself at all, any more than if
he had not been in Moscow. Not long before the "affair" Arátoff had begun to busy himself with
painting for photographic ends; he devoted himself to this with redoubled zeal.

Thus, imperceptibly, with a few "relapses" as the doctors express it, consisting, for example
in the fact that he once came very near going to call on the Princess, two weeks ... three
weeks passed ... and Arátoff became once more the Arátoff of old. Only deep down, under the
surface of his life, something heavy and dark secretly accompanied him in all his comings and
goings. Thus does a large fish which has just been hooked, but has not yet been drawn out,
swim along the bottom of a deep river under the very boat wherein sits the fisherman with his
stout rod in hand.

And lo! one day as he was skimming over some not quite fresh numbers of the Moscow News, Arátoff
hit upon the following correspondence:

"With great sorrow," wrote a certain local literary man from Kazán, "we insert in our theatrical
chronicle the news of the sudden death of our gifted actress, Clara Mílitch, who had succeeded
in the brief space of her engagement in becoming the favourite of our discriminating public.
Our sorrow is all the greater because Miss Mílitch herself put an end to her young life, which
held so much of promise, by means of poison. And this poisoning is all the more dreadful because
the actress took the poison on the stage itself! They barely got her home, where, to universal
regret, she died. Rumours are current in the town to the effect that unrequited love led her
to that terrible deed."

Arátoff softly laid the newspaper on the table. To all appearances he remained perfectly composed
... but something smote him simultaneously in his breast and in his head, and then slowly diffused
itself through all his members. He rose to his feet, stood for a while on one spot, and again
seated himself, and again perused the letter. Then he rose once more, lay down on his bed and
placing his hands under his head, he stared for a long time at the wall like one dazed. Little
by little that wall seemed to recede ... to vanish ... and he beheld before him the boulevard
beneath grey skies and her in her black mantilla ... then her again on the platform ... he
even beheld himself by her side.--That which had smitten him so forcibly in the breast at the
first moment, now began to rise up ... to rise up in his throat.... He tried to cough, to call
some one, but his voice failed him, and to his own amazement, tears which he could not restrain
gushed from his eyes.... What had evoked those tears? Pity? Regret? Or was it simply that his
nerves had been unable to withstand the sudden shock? Surely, she was nothing to him? Was not
that the fact?

"But perhaps that is not true," the thought suddenly occurred to him. "I must find out! But
from whom? From the Princess?--No, from Kupfer ... from Kupfer? But they say he is not in Moscow.--Never
mind! I must apply to him first!"

With these ideas in his head Arátoff hastily dressed himself, summoned a cab and dashed off
to Kupfer.

IX

He had not hoped to find him ... but he did. Kupfer actually had been absent from Moscow for
a time, but had returned about a week previously and was even preparing to call on Arátoff
again. He welcomed him with his customary cordiality, and began to explain something to him
... but Arátoff immediately interrupted him with the impatient question:

"Hast thou read it?--Is it true?"

"Is what true?" replied the astounded Kupfer.

"About Clara Mílitch?"

Kupfer's face expressed compassion.--"Yes, yes, brother, it is true; she has poisoned herself.
It is such a misfortune!"

Arátoff held his peace for a space.--"But hast thou also read it in the newspaper?" he asked:--"Or
perhaps thou hast been to Kazán thyself?"

"I have been to Kazán, in fact; the Princess and I conducted her thither. She went on the stage
there, and had great success. Only I did not remain there until the catastrophe.... I was in
Yaroslávl."

"In Yaroslávl?"

"Yes; I escorted the Princess thither.... She has settled in Yaroslávl now."

"But hast thou trustworthy information?"

"The most trustworthy sort ... at first hand! I made acquaintance in Kazán with her family.--But
stay, my dear fellow ... this news seems to agitate thee greatly.--But I remember that Clara
did not please thee that time! Thou wert wrong! She was a splendid girl--only her head! She
had an ungovernable head! I was greatly distressed about her!"

Arátoff did not utter a word, but dropped down on a chair, and after waiting a while he asked
Kupfer to tell him ... he hesitated.

"What?" asked Kupfer.

"Why ... everything," replied Arátoff slowly.--"About her family, for instance ... and so forth.
Everything thou knowest!"

"But does that interest thee?--Certainly!"

Kupfer, from whose face it was impossible to discern that he had grieved so greatly over Clara,
began his tale.

From his words Arátoff learned that Clara Mílitch's real name had been Katerína Milovídoff;
that her father, now dead, had been an official teacher of drawing in Kazán, had painted bad
portraits and official images, and moreover had borne the reputation of being a drunkard and
a domestic tyrant ... "and a cultured man into the bargain!".... (Here Kupfer laughed in a
self-satisfied manner, by way of hinting at the pun he had made);[60]--that he had left at
his death, in the first place, a widow of the merchant class, a thoroughly stupid female, straight
out of one of Ostróvsky's comedies;[61] and in the second place, a daughter much older than
Clara and bearing no resemblance to her--a very clever girl and "greatly developed, my dear
fellow!" That the two--widow and daughter--lived in easy circumstances, in a decent little
house which had been acquired by the sale of those wretched portraits and holy pictures; that
Clara ... or Kátya, whichever you choose to call her, had astonished every one ever since her
childhood by her talent, but was of an insubordinate, capricious disposition, and was constantly
quarrelling with her father; that having an inborn passion for the theatre, she had run away
from the parental house at the age of sixteen with an actress....

"With an actor?" interjected Arátoff.

"No, not with an actor, but an actress; to whom she had become attached.... This actress had
a protector, it is true, a wealthy gentleman already elderly, who only refrained from marrying
her because he was already married--while the actress, it appeared, was married also."

Further, Kupfer informed Arátoff that, prior to her arrival in Moscow, Clara had acted and
sung in provincial theatres; that on losing her friend the actress (the gentleman had died
also, it seems, or had made it up with his wife--precisely which Kupfer did not quite remember
...), she had made the acquaintance of the Princess, "that woman of gold, whom thou, my friend
Yákoff Andréitch," the narrator added with feeling, "wert not able to appreciate at her true
worth"; that finally Clara had been offered an engagement in Kazán, and had accepted it, although
she had previously declared that she would never leave Moscow!--But how the people of Kazán
had loved her--it was fairly amazing! At every representation she received bouquets and gifts!
bouquets and gifts!--A flour merchant, the greatest bigwig in the government, had even presented
her with a golden inkstand!--Kupfer narrated all this with great animation, but without, however,
displaying any special sentimentality, and interrupting his speech with the question:--"Why
dost thou want to know that?" ... or "To what end is that?" when Arátoff, after listening to
him with devouring attention, demanded more and still more details. Everything was said at
last, and Kupfer ceased speaking, rewarding himself for his toil with a cigar.

"But why did she poison herself?" asked Arátoff. "The newspaper stated...."

Kupfer waved his hands.--"Well.... That I cannot say.... I don't know. But the newspaper lies,
Clara behaved in an exemplary manner ... she had no love-affairs.... And how could she, with
her pride! She was as proud as Satan himself, and inaccessible! An insubordinate head! Firm
as a rock! If thou wilt believe me,--I knew her pretty intimately, seest thou,--I never beheld
a tear in her eyes!"

"But I did," thought Arátoff to himself.

"Only there is this to be said," went on Kupfer:--"I noticed a great change in her of late:
she became so depressed, she would remain silent for hours at a time; you couldn't get a word
out of her. I once asked her: 'Has any one offended you, Katerína Semyónovna?' Because I knew
her disposition: she could not endure an insult. She held her peace, and that was the end of
it! Even her success on the stage did not cheer her up; they would shower her with bouquets
... and she would not smile! She gave one glance at the gold inkstand,--and put it aside!--She
complained that no one would write her a genuine part, as she conceived it. And she gave up
singing entirely. I am to blame, brother!... I repeated to her that thou didst not think she
had any school. But nevertheless ... why she poisoned herself is incomprehensible! And the
way she did it too...."

"In what part did she have the greatest success?".... Arátoff wanted to find out what part
she had played that last time, but for some reason or other he asked something else.

"In Ostróvsky's' Grúnya'[62] I believe. But I repeat to thee: she had no love-affairs! Judge
for thyself by one thing: she lived in her mother's house.... Thou knowest what some of those
merchants' houses are like; a glass case filled with holy images in every corner and a shrine
lamp in front of the case; deadly, stifling heat; a sour odour; in the drawing-room nothing
but chairs ranged along the wall, and geraniums in the windows;--and when a visitor arrives,
the hostess begins to groan as though an enemy were approaching. What chance is there for love-making,
and amours in such a place? Sometimes it happened that they would not even admit me. Their
maid-servant, a robust peasant-woman, in a Turkey red cotton sarafan,[63] and pendulous breasts,
would place herself across the path in the anteroom and roar: 'Whither away?' No, I positively
cannot understand what made her poison herself. She must have grown tired of life," Kupfer
philosophically wound up his remarks.

Arátoff sat with drooping head.--"Canst thou give me the address of that house in Kazán?" he
said at last.

"I can; but what dost thou want of it?--Dost thou wish to send a letter thither?"

"Perhaps so."

"Well, as thou wilt. Only the old woman will not answer thee. Her sister might ... the clever
sister!--But again, brother, I marvel at thee! Such indifference formerly ... and now so much
attention! All that comes of living a solitary life, my dear fellow!"

Arátoff made no reply to this remark and went away, after having procured the address in Kazán.

Agitation, surprise, expectation had been depicted on his face when he went to Kupfer.... Now
he advanced with an even gait, downcast eyes, and hat pulled low down over his brows; almost
every one he met followed him with a searching gaze ... but he paid no heed to the passers-by
... it was quite different from what it had been on the boulevard!...

"Unhappy Clara! Foolish Clara!" resounded in his soul.

X

Nevertheless, Arátoff passed the following day in a fairly tranquil manner. He was even able
to devote himself to his customary occupations. There was only one thing: both during his busy
time and in his leisure moments he thought incessantly of Clara, of what Kupfer had told him
the day before. Truth to tell, his thoughts were also of a decidedly pacific nature. It seemed
to him that that strange young girl interested him from a psychological point of view, as something
in the nature of a puzzle, over whose solution it was worth while to cudgel one's brains,--"She
ran away from home with a kept actress," he thought, "she placed herself under the protection
of that Princess, in whose house she lived,--and had no love-affairs? It is improbable!...
Kupfer says it was pride! But, in the first place, we know" (Arátoff should have said: "we
have read in books") ... "that pride is compatible with light-minded conduct; and in the second
place, did not she, such a proud person, appoint a meeting with a man who might show her scorn
... and appoint it in a public place, into the bargain ... on the boulevard!"--At this point
there recurred to Arátoff's mind the whole scene on the boulevard, and he asked himself: "Had
he really shown scorn for Clara?"--"No," he decided.... That was another feeling ... a feeling
of perplexity ... of distrust, in short!--"Unhappy Clara!" again rang through his brain.--"Yes,
she was unhappy," he decided again ... that was the most fitting word.

"But if that is so, I was unjust. She spoke truly when she said that I did not understand her.
'Tis a pity!--It may be that a very remarkable being has passed so close to me ... and I did
not take advantage of the opportunity, but repulsed her.... Well, never mind! My life is still
before me. I shall probably have other encounters of a different sort!

"But what prompted her to pick out me in particular?"--He cast a glance at a mirror which he
was passing at the moment. "What is there peculiar about me? And what sort of a beauty am I?--My
face is like everybody else's face.... However, she was not a beauty either.

"She was not a beauty ... but what an expressive face she had! Impassive ... but expressive!
I have never before seen such a face.--And she has talent ... that is to say, she had talent,
undoubted talent. Wild, untrained, even coarse ... but undoubted.--And in that case also I
was unjust to her."--Arátoff mentally transported himself to the musical morning ... and noticed
that he remembered with remarkable distinctness every word she had sung or recited, every intonation....
That would not have been the case had she been devoid of talent.

"And now all that is in the grave, where she has thrust herself.... But I have nothing to do
with that.... I am not to blame! It would even be absurd to think that I am to blame."--Again
it flashed into Arátoff's mind that even had she had "anything of that sort" about her, his
conduct during the interview would indubitably have disenchanted her. That was why she had
broken into such harsh laughter at parting.--And where was the proof that she had poisoned
herself on account of an unhappy love? It is only newspaper correspondents who attribute every
such death to unhappy love!--But life easily becomes repulsive to people with character, like
Clara ... and tiresome. Yes, tiresome. Kupfer was right: living simply bored her.

"In spite of her success, of her ovations?"--Arátoff meditated.--The psychological analysis
to which he surrendered himself was even agreeable to him. Unaccustomed as he had been, up
to this time, to all contact with women, he did not suspect how significant for him was this
tense examination of a woman's soul.

"Consequently," he pursued his meditations, "art did not satisfy her, did not fill the void
of her life. Genuine artists exist only for art, for the theatre.... Everything else pales
before that which they regard as their vocation.... She was a dilettante!"

Here Arátoff again became thoughtful.--No, the word "dilettante" did not consort with that
face, with the expression of that face, of those eyes....

And again there rose up before him the image of Clara with her tear-filled eyes riveted upon
him, and her clenched hands raised to her lips....

"Akh, I won't think of it, I won't think of it ..." he whispered.... "What is the use?"

In this manner the whole day passed. During dinner Arátoff chatted a great deal with Platósha,
questioned her about old times, which, by the way, she recalled and transmitted badly, as she
was not possessed of a very glib tongue, and had noticed hardly anything in the course of her
life save her Yáshka. She merely rejoiced that he was so good-natured and affectionate that
day!--Toward evening Arátoff quieted down to such a degree that he played several games of
trumps with his aunt.

Thus passed the day ... but the night was quite another matter!

XI

It began well; he promptly fell asleep, and when his aunt entered his room on tiptoe for the
purpose of making the sign of the cross over him thrice as he slept--she did this every night--he
was lying and breathing as quietly as a child.--But before daybreak he had a vision.

He dreamed that he was walking over the bare steppes, sown with stones, beneath a low-hanging
sky. Between the stones wound a path; he was advancing along it.

Suddenly there rose up in front of him something in the nature of a delicate cloud. He looked
intently at it; the little cloud turned into a woman in a white gown, with a bright girdle
about her waist. She was hurrying away from him. He did not see either her face or her hair
... a long piece of tissue concealed them. But he felt bound to overtake her and look into
her eyes. Only, no matter how much haste he made, she still walked more quickly than he.

On the path lay a broad, flat stone, resembling a tomb-stone. It barred her way. The woman
came to a halt. Arátoff ran up to her. She turned toward him--but still he could not see her
eyes ... they were closed. Her face was white,--white as snow; her arms hung motionless. She
resembled a statue.

Slowly, without bending a single limb, she leaned backward and sank down on that stone....
And now Arátoff was lying beside her, outstretched like a mortuary statue,--and his hands were
folded like those of a corpse.

But at this point the woman suddenly rose to her feet and went away. Arátoff tried to rise
also ... but he could not stir, he could not unclasp his hands, and could only gaze after her
in despair.

Then the woman suddenly turned round, and he beheld bright, vivacious eyes in a living face,
which was strange to him, however. She was laughing, beckoning to him with her hand ... and
still he was unable to move.

She laughed yet once again, and swiftly retreated, merrily nodding her head, on which a garland
of tiny roses gleamed crimson.

Arátoff strove to shout, strove to break that frightful nightmare.... Suddenly everything grew
dark round about ... and the woman returned to him.

But she was no longer a statue whom he knew not ... she was Clara. She halted in front of him,
folded her arms, and gazed sternly and attentively at him. Her lips were tightly compressed,
but it seemed to Arátoff that he heard the words:

"If thou wishest to know who I am, go thither!"

"Whither?" he asked.

"Thither!"--the moaning answer made itself audible.--"Thither!"

Arátoff awoke.

He sat up in bed, lighted a candle which stood on his night-stand, but did not rise, and sat
there for a long time slowly gazing about him. It seemed to him that something had taken place
within him since he went to bed; that something had taken root within him ... something had
taken possession of him. "But can that be possible?" he whispered unconsciously. "Can it be
that such a power exists?"

He could not remain in bed. He softly dressed himself and paced his chamber until daylight.
And strange to say! He did not think about Clara for a single minute,--and he did not think
about her because he had made up his mind to set off for Kazán that very day!

He thought only of that journey, of how it was to be made, and what he ought to take with him,--and
how he would there ferret out and find out everything,--and regain his composure.

"If thou dost not go," he argued with himself, "thou wilt surely lose thy reason!" He was afraid
of that; he was afraid of his nerves. He was convinced that as soon as he should see all that
with his own eyes, all obsessions would flee like a nocturnal nightmare.--"And the journey
will occupy not more than a week in all," he thought.... "What is a week? And there is no other
way of ridding myself of it."

The rising sun illuminated his room; but the light of day did not disperse the shades of night
which weighed upon him, did not alter his decision.

Platósha came near having an apoplectic stroke when he communicated his decision to her. She
even squatted down on her heels ... her legs gave way under her. "To Kazán? Why to Kazán?"
she whispered, protruding her eyes which were already blind enough without that. She would
not have been any more astounded had she learned that her Yásha was going to marry the neighbouring
baker's daughter, or depart to America.--"And shalt thou stay long in Kazán?"

"I shall return at the end of a week," replied Arátoff, as he stood half-turned away from his
aunt, who was still sitting on the floor.

Platósha tried to remonstrate again, but Arátoff shouted at her in an utterly unexpected and
unusual manner:

"I am not a baby," he yelled, turning pale all over, while his lips quivered and his eyes flashed
viciously.--"I am six-and-twenty years of age. I know what I am about,--I am free to do as
I please!--I will not permit any one.... Give me money for the journey; prepare a trunk with
linen and clothing ... and do not bother me! I shall return at the end of a week, Platósha,"
he added, in a softer tone.

Platósha rose to her feet, grunting, and, making no further opposition, wended her way to her
chamber. Yásha had frightened her.--"I have not a head on my shoulders," she remarked to the
cook, who was helping her to pack Yásha's things,--"not a head--but a bee-hive ... and what
bees are buzzing there I do not know! He is going away to Kazán, my mother, to Ka-zá-án!"

The cook, who had noticed their yard-porter talking for a long time to the policeman about
something, wanted to report this circumstance to her mistress, but she did not dare, and merely
thought to herself: "To Kazán? If only it isn't some place further away!"--And Platonída Ivánovna
was so distracted that she did not even utter her customary prayer.--In such a catastrophe
as this even the Lord God could be of no assistance!

That same day Arátoff set off for Kazán.

XII

No sooner had he arrived in that town and engaged a room at the hotel, than he dashed off in
search of the widow Milovídoff's house. During the whole course of his journey he had been
in a sort of stupor, which, nevertheless, did not in the least prevent his taking all proper
measures,--transferring himself at Nizhni Nóvgorod from the railway to the steamer, eating
at the stations, and so forth. As before, he was convinced that everything would be cleared
up there, and accordingly he banished from his thoughts all memories and speculations, contenting
himself with one thing,--the mental preparation of the speech in which he was to set forth
to Clara Mílitch's family the real reason of his trip.--And now, at last, he had attained to
the goal of his yearning, and ordered the servant to announce him. He was admitted--with surprise
and alarm--but he was admitted.

The widow Milovídoff's house proved to be in fact just as Kupfer had described it; and the
widow herself really did resemble one of Ostróvsky's women of the merchant class, although
she was of official rank; her husband had been a Collegiate Assessor.[64] Not without some
difficulty did Arátoff, after having preliminarily excused himself for his boldness, and the
strangeness of his visit, make the speech which he had prepared, to the effect that he wished
to collect all the necessary information concerning the gifted actress who had perished at
such an early age; that he was actuated not by idle curiosity, but by a profound sympathy for
her talent, of which he was a worshipper (he said exactly that--"a worshipper"); that, in conclusion,
it would be a sin to leave the public in ignorance of the loss it had sustained,--and why its
hopes had not been realized!

Madame Milovídoff did not interrupt Arátoff; it is hardly probable that she understood very
clearly what this strange visitor was saying to her, and she merely swelled a little with pride,
and opened her eyes widely at him on perceiving that he had a peaceable aspect, and was decently
clad, and was not some sort of swindler ... and was not asking for any money.

"Are you saying that about Kátya?" she asked, as soon as Arátoff ceased speaking.

"Exactly so ... about your daughter."

"And you have come from Moscow for that purpose?"

"Yes, from Moscow."

"Merely for that?"

"Merely for that."

Madame Milovídoff suddenly took fright.--"Why, you--are an author? Do you write in the newspapers?"

"No, I am not an author,--and up to the present time, I have never written for the newspapers."

The widow bent her head. She was perplexed.

"Consequently ... it is for your own pleasure?" she suddenly inquired. Arátoff did not immediately
hit upon the proper answer.

"Out of sympathy, out of reverence for talent," he said at last.

The word "reverence" pleased Madame Milovídoff. "Very well!" she ejaculated with a sigh....
"Although I am her mother, and grieved very greatly over her.... It was such a catastrophe,
you know!... Still, I must say, that she was always a crazy sort of girl, and ended up in the
same way! Such a disgrace.... Judge for yourself: what sort of a thing is that for a mother?
We may be thankful that they even buried her in Christian fashion...." Madame Milovídoff crossed
herself.--"From the time she was a small child she submitted to no one,--she abandoned the
paternal roof ... and finally, it is enough to say that she became an actress! Every one knows
that I did not turn her out of the house; for I loved her! For I am her mother, all the same!
She did not have to live with strangers,--and beg alms!..." Here the widow melted into tears.--"But
if you, sir," she began afresh, wiping her eyes with the ends of her kerchief, "really have
that intention, and if you will not concoct anything dishonourable about us,--but if, on the
contrary, you wish to show us a favour,--then you had better talk with my other daughter. She
will tell you everything better than I can...." "Ánnotchka!" called Madame Milovídoff:--"Ánnotchka,
come hither! There's some gentleman or other from Moscow who wants to talk about Kátya!"

There was a crash in the adjoining room, but no one appeared.--"Ánnotchka!" cried the widow
again--"Anna Semyónovna! come hither, I tell thee!"

The door opened softly and on the threshold appeared a girl no longer young, of sickly aspect,
and homely, but with very gentle and sorrowful eyes. Arátoff rose from his seat to greet her,
and introduced himself, at the same time mentioning his friend Kupfer.--"Ah! Feódor Feódoritch!"
ejaculated the girl softly, as she softly sank down on a chair.

"Come, now, talk with the gentleman," said Madame Milovídoff, rising ponderously from her seat:
"He has taken the trouble to come expressly from Moscow,--he wishes to collect information
about Kátya. But you must excuse me, sir," she added, turning to Arátoff.... "I shall go away,
to attend to domestic affairs. You can have a good explanation with Ánnotchka--she will tell
you about the theatre ... and all that sort of thing. She's my clever, well-educated girl:
she speaks French and reads books quite equal to her dead sister. And she educated her sister,
I may say.... She was the elder--well, and so she taught her."

Madame Milovídoff withdrew. When Arátoff was left alone with Anna Semyónovna he repeated his
speech; but from the first glance he understood that he had to deal with a girl who really
was cultured, not with a merchant's daughter,--and so he enlarged somewhat, and employed different
expressions;--and toward the end he became agitated, flushed, and felt conscious that his heart
was beating hard. Anna Semyónovna listened to him in silence, with her hands folded; the sad
smile did not leave her face ... bitter woe which had not ceased to cause pain, was expressed
in that smile.

"Did you know my sister?" she asked Arátoff.

"No; properly speaking, I did not know her," he replied. "I saw and heard your sister once
... but all that was needed was to hear and see your sister once, in order to...."

"Do you mean to write her biography?" Anna put another question.

Arátoff had not expected that word; nevertheless, he immediately answered "Why not?" But the
chief point was that he wished to acquaint the public....

Anna stopped him with a gesture of her hand.

"To what end? The public caused her much grief without that; and Kátya had only just begun
to live. But if you yourself" (Anna looked at him and again smiled that same sad smile, only
now it was more cordial ... apparently she was thinking: "Yes, thou dost inspire me with confidence")
... "if you yourself cherish such sympathy for her, then permit me to request that you come
to us this evening ... after dinner. I cannot now ... so suddenly.... I will collect my forces....
I will make an effort.... Akh, I loved her too greatly!"

Anna turned away; she was on the point of bursting into sobs.

Arátoff rose alertly from his chair, thanked her for her proposal, said that he would come
without fail ... without fail! and went away, bearing in his soul an impression of a quiet
voice, of gentle and sorrowful eyes--and burning with the languor of anticipation.

XIII

Arátoff returned to the Milovídoffs' house that same day, and conversed for three whole hours
with Anna Semyónovna. Madame Milovídoff went to bed immediately after dinner--at two o'clock--and
"rested" until evening tea, at seven o'clock. Arátoff's conversation with Clara's sister was
not, properly speaking, a conversation: she did almost the whole of the talking, at first with
hesitation, with confusion, but afterward with uncontrollable fervour. She had, evidently,
idolised her sister. The confidence wherewith Arátoff had inspired her waxed and strengthened;
she was no longer embarrassed; she even fell to weeping softly, twice, in his presence. He
seemed to her worthy of her frank revelations and effusions. Nothing of that sort had ever
before come into her own dull life!... And he ... he drank in her every word.

This, then, is what he learned ... much of it, as a matter of course, from what she refrained
from saying ... and much he filled out for himself.

In her youth Clara had been, without doubt, a disagreeable child; and as a young girl she had
been only a little softer: self-willed, hot-tempered, vain, she had not got on particularly
well with her father, whom she despised for his drunkenness and incapacity. He was conscious
of this and did not pardon it in her. Her musical faculties showed themselves at an early age;
her father repressed them, recognising painting as the sole art,--wherein he himself had had
so little success, but which had nourished him and his family. Clara had loved her mother ...
in a careless way, as she would have loved a nurse; she worshipped her sister, although she
squabbled with her, and bit her.... It is true that afterward she had been wont to go down
on her knees before her and kiss the bitten places. She was all fire, all passion, and all
contradiction: vengeful and kind-hearted, magnanimous and rancorous; "she believed in Fate,
and did not believe in God" (these words Anna whispered with terror); she loved everything
that was beautiful, and dressed herself at haphazard; she could not endure to have young men
pay court to her, but in books she read only those pages where love was the theme; she did
not care to please, she did not like petting and never forgot caresses as she never forgot
offences; she was afraid of death, and she had killed herself! She had been wont to say sometimes,
"I do not meet the sort of man I want--and the others I will not have!"--"Well, and what if
you should meet the right sort?" Anna had asked her.--"If I do ... I shall take him."--"But
what if he will not give himself?"--"Well, then ... I will make an end of myself. It will mean
that I am good for nothing."

Clara's father ... (he sometimes asked his wife when he was drunk: "Who was the father of that
black-visaged little devil of thine?--I was not!")--Clara's father, in the endeavour to get
her off his hands as promptly as possible, undertook to betroth her to a wealthy young merchant,
a very stupid fellow,--one of the "cultured" sort. Two weeks before the wedding (she was only
sixteen years of age), she walked up to her betrothed, folded her arms, and drumming with her
fingers on her elbows (her favourite pose), she suddenly dealt him a blow, bang! on his rosy
cheek with her big, strong hand! He sprang to his feet, and merely gasped,--it must be stated
that he was dead in love with her.... He asked: "What is that for?" She laughed and left the
room.--"I was present in the room," narrated Anna, "and was a witness. I ran after her and
said to her: 'Good gracious, Kátya, why didst thou do that?'--But she answered me: 'If he were
a real man he would have thrashed me, but as it is, he is a wet hen!' And he asks what it is
for, to boot. If he loved me and did not avenge himself, then let him bear it and not ask:
'what is that for?' He'll never get anything of me, unto ages of ages!' And so she did not
marry him. Soon afterward she made the acquaintance of that actress, and left our house. My
mother wept, but my father only said: 'Away with the refractory goat from the flock!' and would
take no trouble, or try to hunt her up. Father did not understand Clara. On the eve of her
flight," added Anna, "she almost strangled me in her embrace, and kept repeating: 'I cannot!
I cannot do otherwise!... My heart may break in two, but I cannot! our cage is too small ...
it is not large enough for my wings! And one cannot escape his fate'"....

"After that," remarked Anna, "we rarely saw each other.... When father died she came to us
for a couple of days, took nothing from the inheritance, and again disappeared. She found it
oppressive with us.... I saw that. Then she returned to Kazán as an actress."

Arátoff began to interrogate Anna concerning the theatre, the parts in which Clara had appeared,
her success.... Anna answered in detail, but with the same sad, although animated enthusiasm.
She even showed Arátoff a photographic portrait, which represented Clara in the costume of
one of her parts. In the portrait she was looking to one side, as though turning away from
the spectators; the ribbon intertwined with her thick hair fell like a serpent on her bare
arm. Arátoff gazed long at that portrait, thought it a good likeness, inquired whether Clara
had not taken part in public readings, and learned that she had not; that she required the
excitement of the theatre, of the stage ... but another question was burning on his lips.

"Anna Semyónovna!" he exclaimed at last, not loudly, but with peculiar force, "tell me, I entreat
you, why she ... why she made up her mind to that frightful step?"

Anna dropped her eyes.--"I do not know!" she said, after the lapse of several minutes.--"God
is my witness, I do not know!" she continued impetuously, perceiving that Arátoff had flung
his hands apart as though he did not believe her.... "From the very time she arrived here she
seemed to be thoughtful, gloomy. Something must infallibly have happened to her in Moscow,
which I was not able to divine! But, on the contrary, on that fatal day, she seemed ... if
not more cheerful, at any rate more tranquil than usual. I did not even have any forebodings,"
added Anna with a bitter smile, as though reproaching herself for that.

"You see," she began again, "it seemed to have been written in Kátya's fate, that she should
be unhappy. She was convinced of it herself from her early youth. She would prop her head on
her hand, meditate, and say: 'I shall not live long!' She had forebodings. Just imagine, she
even saw beforehand,--sometimes in a dream, sometimes in ordinary wise,--what was going to
happen to her! 'I cannot live as I wish, so I will not live at all,' ... was her adage.--'Our
life is in our own hands, you know!' And she proved it."

Anna covered her face with her hands and ceased speaking.

"Anna Semyónovna," began Arátoff, after waiting a little: "perhaps you have heard to what the
newspapers attributed...."

"To unhappy love?" interrupted Anna, removing her hands from her face with a jerk. "That is
a calumny, a calumny, a lie!... My unsullied, unapproachable Kátya ... Kátya! ... and an unhappy,
rejected love? And would not I have known about that?... Everybody, everybody fell in love
with her ... but she.... And whom could she have fallen in love with here? Who, out of all
these men, was worthy of her? Who had attained to that ideal of honour, uprightness, purity,--most
of all, purity,--which she constantly held before her, in spite of all her defects?... Reject
her ... her...."

Anna's voice broke.... Her fingers trembled slightly. Suddenly she flushed scarlet all over
... flushed with indignation, and at that moment--and only at that moment--did she resemble
her sister.

Arátoff attempted to apologise.

"Listen," broke in Anna once more:--"I insist upon it that you shall not believe that calumny
yourself, and that you shall dissipate it, if possible! Here, you wish to write an article
about her, or something of that sort:--here is an opportunity for you to defend her memory!
That is why I am talking so frankly with you. Listen: Kátya left a diary...."

Arátoff started.--"A diary," he whispered.

"Yes, a diary ... that is to say, a few pages only.--Kátya was not fond of writing ... for
whole months together she did not write at all ... and her letters were so short! But she was
always, always truthful, she never lied.... Lie, forsooth, with her vanity! I ... I will show
you that diary! You shall see for yourself whether it contains a single hint of any such unhappy
love!"

Anna hastily drew from the table-drawer a thin copy-book, about ten pages in length, no more,
and offered it to Arátoff. The latter grasped it eagerly, recognised the irregular, bold handwriting,--the
handwriting of that anonymous letter,--opened it at random, and began at the following lines:

     "Moscow--Tuesday ... June. I sang and recited at a literary
     morning. To-day is a significant day for me. It must decide my
     fate." (These words were doubly underlined.) "Once more I have
     seen...." Here followed several lines which had been carefully
     blotted out.--And then: "No! no! no!... I must return to my former
     idea, if only...."

Arátoff dropped the hand in which he held the book, and his head sank quietly on his breast.

"Read!" cried Anna.--"Why don't you read? Read from the beginning.... You can read the whole
of it in five minutes, though this diary extends over two whole years. In Kazán she wrote nothing...."

Arátoff slowly rose from his chair, and fairly crashed down on his knees before Anna!

She was simply petrified with amazement and terror.

"Give ... give me this diary," said Arátoff in a fainting voice.--"Give it to me ... and the
photograph ... you must certainly have another--but I will return the diary to you.... But
I must, I must...."

In his entreaty, in the distorted features of his face there was something so despairing that
it even resembled wrath, suffering.... And in reality he was suffering. It seemed as though
he had not been able to foresee that such a calamity would descend upon him, and was excitedly
begging to be spared, to be saved....

"Give it to me," he repeated.

"But ... you ... you were not in love with my sister?" said Anna at last.

Arátoff continued to kneel.

"I saw her twice in all ... believe me!... and if I had not been impelled by causes which I
myself cannot clearly either understand or explain ... if some power that is stronger than
I were not upon me.... I would not have asked you.... I would not have come hither.... I must
... I ought ... why, you said yourself that I was bound to restore her image!"

"And you were not in love with my sister?" asked Anna for the second time.

Arátoff did not reply at once, and turned away slightly, as though with pain.

"Well, yes! I was! I was!--And I am in love with her now...." he exclaimed with the same desperation
as before.

Footsteps became audible in the adjoining room.

"Rise ... rise ..." said Anna hastily. "My mother is coming."

Arátoff rose.

"And take the diary and the picture. God be with you!--Poor, poor Kátya!... But you must return
the diary to me," she added with animation.--"And if you write anything, you must be sure to
send it to me.... Do you hear?"

The appearance of Madame Milovídoff released Arátoff from the necessity of replying.--He succeeded,
nevertheless, in whispering:--"You are an angel! Thanks! I will send all that I write...."

Madame Milovídoff was too drowsy to divine anything. And so Arátoff left Kazán with the photographic
portrait in the side-pocket of his coat. He had returned the copy-book to Anna, but without
her having detected it, he had cut out the page on which stood the underlined words.

On his way back to Moscow he was again seized with a sort of stupor. Although he secretly rejoiced
that he had got what he went for, yet he repelled all thoughts of Clara until he should reach
home again. He meditated a great deal more about her sister Anna.--"Here now," he said to himself,
"is a wonderful, sympathetic being! What a delicate comprehension of everything, what a loving
heart, what absence of egoism! And how comes it that such girls bloom with us, and in the provinces,--and
in such surroundings into the bargain! She is both sickly, and ill-favoured, and not young,--but
what a capital wife she would make for an honest, well-educated man! That is the person with
whom one ought to fall in love!..." Arátoff meditated thus ... but on his arrival in Moscow
the matter took quite another turn.

XIV

Platonída Ivánova was unspeakably delighted at the return of her nephew. She had thought all
sorts of things during his absence!--"At the very least he has gone to Siberia!" she whispered,
as she sat motionless in her little chamber: "for a year at the very least!"--Moreover the
cook had frightened her by imparting the most authentic news concerning the disappearance of
first one, then another young man from the neighbourhood. Yásha's complete innocence and trustworthiness
did not in the least serve to calm the old woman.--"Because ... much that signifies!--he busies
himself with photography ... well, and that is enough! Seize him!" And now here was her Yáshenka
come back to her safe and sound! She did notice, it is true, that he appeared to have grown
thin, and his face seemed to be sunken--that was comprehensible ... he had had no one to look
after him. But she did not dare to question him concerning his trip. At dinner she inquired:

"And is Kazán a nice town?"

"Yes," replied Arátoff.

"Tatárs live there, I believe?"

"Not Tatárs only."

"And hast not thou brought a khalát[65] thence?"

"No, I have not."

And there the conversation ended.

But as soon as Arátoff found himself alone in his study he immediately felt as though something
were embracing him round about, as though he were again in the power,--precisely that, in the
power of another life, of another being. Although he had told Anna--in that outburst of sudden
frenzy--that he was in love with Clara, that word now seemed to him devoid of sense and whimsical.--No,
he was not in love; and how could he fall in love with a dead woman, whom, even during her
lifetime he had not liked, whom he had almost forgotten?--No! But he was in the power of ...
in her power ... he no longer belonged to himself. He had been taken possession of. Taken possession
of to such a point that he was no longer trying to free himself either by ridiculing his own
stupidity, or by arousing in himself if not confidence, at least hope that all this would pass
over, that it was nothing but nerves,--or by seeking proofs of it,--or in any other way!--"If
I meet him I shall take him" he recalled Clara's words reported by Anna ... and so now he had
been taken.

But was not she dead? Yes; her body was dead ... but how about her soul?--Was not that immortal
... did it require bodily organs to manifest its power? Magnetism has demonstrated to us the
influence of the living human soul upon another living human soul.... Why should not that influence
be continued after death, if the soul remains alive?--But with what object? What might be the
result of this?--But do we, in general, realise the object of everything which goes on around us?

These reflections occupied Arátoff to such a degree that at tea he suddenly asked Platósha
whether she believed in the immortality of the soul. She did not understand at first what it
was he had asked; but afterward she crossed herself and replied, "of course. How could the
soul be otherwise than immortal?"

"But if that is so, can it act after death?" Arátoff put a second question.

The old woman replied that it could ... that is to say, it can pray for us; when it shall have
passed through all sorts of tribulations, and is awaiting the Last Judgment. But during the
first forty days it only hovers around the spot where its death occurred.

"During the first forty days?"

"Yes; and after that come its tribulations."[66]

Arátoff was surprised at his aunt's erudition, and went off to his own room.--And again he
felt the same thing, that same power upon him. The power was manifested thus--that the image
of Clara incessantly presented itself to him, in its most minute details,--details which he
did not seem to have observed during her lifetime; he saw ... he saw her fingers, her nails,
the bands of hair on her cheeks below her temples, a small mole under the left eye; he saw
the movement of her lips, her nostrils, her eyebrows ... and what sort of a gait she had, and
how she held her head a little on the right side ... he saw everything!--He did not admire
all this at all; he simply could not help thinking about it and seeing it.--Yet he did not
dream about her during the first night after his return ... he was very weary and slept like
one slain. On the other hand, no sooner did he awake than she again entered his room, and there
she remained, as though she had been its owner; just as though she had purchased for herself
that right by her voluntary death, without asking him or requiring his permission.

He took her photograph; he began to reproduce it, to enlarge it. Then it occurred to him to
arrange it for the stereoscope. It cost him a great deal of trouble, but at last he succeeded.
He fairly started when he beheld through the glass her figure which had acquired the semblance
of bodily substance. But that figure was grey, as though covered with dust ... and moreover,
the eyes ... the eyes still gazed aside, as though they were averting themselves. He began
to gaze at them for a long, long time, as though expecting that they might, at any moment,
turn themselves in his direction ... he even puckered up his eyes deliberately ... but the
eyes remained motionless, and the whole figure assumed the aspect of a doll. He went away,
threw himself into an arm-chair, got out the leaf which he had torn from her diary, with the
underlined words, and thought: "They say that people in love kiss the lines which have been
written by a beloved hand; but I have no desire to do that--and the chirography appears to
me ugly into the bargain. But in that line lies my condemnation."--At this point there flashed
into his mind the promise he had made to Anna about the article. He seated himself at his table,
and set about writing it; but everything he wrote turned out so rhetorical ... worst of all,
so artificial ... just as though he did not believe in what he was writing, or in his own feelings
... and Clara herself seemed to him unrecognisable, incomprehensible! She would not yield herself
to him.

"No," he thought, throwing aside his pen, "either I have no talent for writing in general,
or I must wait a while yet!"

He began to call to mind his visit to the Milovídoffs, and all the narration of Anna, of that
kind, splendid Anna.... The word she had uttered: "unsullied!" suddenly struck him. It was
exactly as though something had scorched and illuminated him.

"Yes," he said aloud, "she was unsullied and I am unsullied.... That is what has given her
this power!"

Thoughts concerning the immortality of the soul, the life beyond the grave, again visited him.
"Is it not said in the Bible: 'O death, where is thy sting?' And in Schiller: 'And the dead
also shall live!' (Auch die Todten sollen leben!)--Or here again, in Mickiewicz, 'I shall love
until life ends ... and after life ends!'--While one English writer has said: 'Love is stronger
than death!'"--The biblical sentence acted with peculiar force on Arátoff. He wanted to look
up the place where those words were to be found.... He had no Bible; he went to borrow one
from Platósha. She was astonished; but she got out an old, old book in a warped leather binding
with brass clasps, all spotted with wax, and handed it to Arátoff. XV, verse 13).

He thought: "That is not properly expressed.--It should read: 'Greater power hath no man!'"....

"But what if she did not set her soul on me at all? What if she killed herself merely because
life had become a burden to her?--What if she, in conclusion, did not come to that tryst with
the object of obtaining declarations of love at all?"

But at that moment Clara before her parting on the boulevard rose up before him.... He recalled
that sorrowful expression on her face, and those tears, and those words:--"Akh, you have understood
nothing!"

No! He could not doubt for what object and for what person she had laid down her life....

Thus passed that day until nightfall.

XV

Arátoff went early to bed, without feeling particularly sleepy; but he hoped to find rest in
bed. The strained condition of his nerves caused him a fatigue which was far more intolerable
than the physical weariness of the journey and the road. But great as was his fatigue, he could
not get to sleep. He tried to read ... but the lines got entangled before his eyes. He extinguished
his candle, and darkness took possession of his chamber.--But he continued to lie there sleepless,
with closed eyes.... And now it seemed to him that some one was whispering in his ear.... "It
is the beating of my heart, the rippling of the blood," he thought.... But the whisper passed
into coherent speech. Some one was talking Russian hurriedly, plaintively, and incomprehensibly.
It was impossible to distinguish a single separate word.... But it was Clara's voice!

Arátoff opened his eyes, rose up in bed, propped himself on his elbows.... The voice grew fainter,
but continued its plaintive, hurried, unintelligible speech as before....

It was indubitably Clara's voice!

Some one's fingers ran over the keys of the piano in light arpeggios.... Then the voice began
to speak again. More prolonged sounds made themselves audible ... like moans ... always the
same. And then words began to detach themselves....

"Roses ... roses ... roses."....

"Roses," repeated Arátoff in a whisper.--

"Akh, yes! The roses which I saw on the head of that woman in my dream...."

"Roses," was audible again.

"Is it thou?" asked Arátoff, whispering as before.

The voice suddenly ceased.

Arátoff waited ... waited--and dropped his head on his pillow. "A hallucination of hearing,"
he thought. "Well, and what if ... what if she really is here, close to me?... What if I were
to see her, would I be frightened? But why should I be frightened? Why should I rejoice? Possibly
because it would be a proof that there is another world, that the soul is immortal.--But, however,
even if I were to see anything, that also might be a hallucination of the sight"....

Nevertheless he lighted his candle, and shot a glance over the whole room not without some
trepidation ... and descried nothing unusual in it. He rose, approached the stereoscope ...
and there again was the same grey doll, with eyes which gazed to one side. The feeling of alarm
in Arátoff was replaced by one of vexation. He had been, as it were, deceived in his expectations
... and those same expectations appeared to him absurd.--"Well, this is downright stupid!"
he muttered as he got back into bed, and blew out his light. Again profound darkness reigned
in the room.

Arátoff made up his mind to go to sleep this time.... But a new sensation had cropped up within
him. It seemed to him as though some one were standing in the middle of the room, not far from
him, and breathing in a barely perceptible manner. He hastily turned round, opened his eyes....
But what could be seen in that impenetrable darkness?--He began to fumble for a match on his
night-stand ... and suddenly it seemed to him as though some soft, noiseless whirlwind dashed
across the whole room, above him, through him--and the words: "'Tis I!" rang plainly in his
ears. "'Tis I! 'Tis I!..."

Several moments passed before he succeeded in lighting a match.

Again there was no one in the room, and he no longer heard anything except the violent beating
of his own heart. He drank a glass of water, and remained motionless, with his head resting
on his hand.

He said to himself: "I will wait. Either this is all nonsense ... or she is here. She will
not play with me like a cat with a mouse!" He waited, waited a long time ... so long that the
hand on which he was propping his head became numb ... but not a single one of his previous
sensations was repeated. A couple of times his eyes closed.... He immediately opened them ...
at least, it seemed to him that he opened them. Gradually they became riveted on the door and
so remained. The candle burned out and the room became dark once more ... but the door gleamed
like a long, white spot in the midst of the gloom. And lo! that spot began to move, it contracted,
vanished ... and in its place, on the threshold, a female form made its appearance. Arátoff
looked at it intently ... it was Clara! And this time she was gazing straight at him, she moved
toward him.... On her head was a wreath of red roses.... It kept undulating, rising....

Before him stood his aunt in her nightcap, with a broad red ribbon, and in a white wrapper.

"Platósha!" he enunciated with difficulty.--"Is it you?"

"It is I," replied Platonída Ivánovna.... "It is I, Yashyónotchek, it is I."

"Why have you come?"

"Why, thou didst wake me. At first thou seemedst to be moaning all the while ... and then suddenly
thou didst begin to shout: 'Save me! Help me!'"

"I shouted?"

"Yes, thou didst shout, and so hoarsely: 'Save me!'--I thought: 'O Lord! Can he be ill?' So
I entered. Art thou well?"

"Perfectly well."

"Come, that means that thou hast had a bad dream. I will fumigate with incense if thou wishest--shall
I?"

Again Arátoff gazed intently at his aunt, and burst into a loud laugh.... The figure of the
kind old woman in nightcap and wrapper, with her frightened, long-drawn face, really was extremely
comical. All that mysterious something which had surrounded him, had stifled him, all those
delusions dispersed on the instant.

"No, Platósha, my dear, it is not necessary," he said.--"Forgive me for having involuntarily
alarmed you. May your rest be tranquil--and I will go to sleep also."

Platonída Ivánovna stood a little while longer on the spot where she was, pointed at the candle,
grumbled: "Why dost thou not extinguish it? ... there will be a catastrophe before long!"--and
as she retired, could not refrain from making the sign of the cross over him from afar.

Arátoff fell asleep immediately, and slept until morning. He rose in a fine frame of mind ...
although he regretted something.... He felt light and free. "What romantic fancies one does
devise," he said to himself with a smile. He did not once glance either at the stereoscope
or the leaf which he had torn out. But immediately after breakfast he set off to see Kupfer.

What drew him thither ... he dimly recognised.

XVI

Arátoff found his sanguine friend at home. He chatted a little with him, reproached him for
having quite forgotten him and his aunt, listened to fresh laudations of the golden woman,
the Princess, from whom Kupfer had just received,--from Yaroslávl,--a skull-cap embroidered
with fish-scales ... and then suddenly sitting down in front of Kupfer, and looking him straight
in the eye, he announced that he had been to Kazán.

"Thou hast been to Kazán? Why so?"

"Why, because I wished to collect information about that ... Clara Mílitch."

"The girl who poisoned herself?"

"Yes."

Kupfer shook his head.--"What a fellow thou art! And such a sly one! Thou hast travelled a
thousand versts there and back ... and all for what? Hey? If there had only been some feminine
interest there! Then I could understand everything! every sort of folly!"--Kupfer ruffled up
his hair.--"But for the sake of collecting materials, as you learned men put it.... No, I thank
you! That's what the committee of statistics exists for!--Well, and what about it--didst thou
make acquaintance with the old woman and with her sister? She's a splendid girl, isn't she?"

"Splendid," assented Arátoff.--"She communicated to me many curious things."

"Did she tell thee precisely how Clara poisoned herself?"

"Thou meanest ... what dost thou mean?"

"Why, in what manner?"

"No.... She was still in such affliction.... I did not dare to question her too much. But was
there anything peculiar about it?"

"Of course there was. Just imagine: she was to have acted that very day--and she did act. She
took a phial of poison with her to the theatre, drank it before the first act, and in that
condition played through the whole of that act. With the poison inside her! What dost thou
think of that strength of will? What character, wasn't it? And they say that she never sustained
her role with so much feeling, with so much warmth! The audience suspected nothing, applauded,
recalled her.... But as soon as the curtain fell she dropped down where she stood on the stage.
She began to writhe ... and writhe ... and at the end of an hour her spirit fled! But is it
possible I did not tell thee that? It was mentioned in the newspapers also."

Arátoff's hands suddenly turned cold and his chest began to heave. "No, thou didst not tell
me that," he said at last.--"And dost thou not know what the piece was?"

Kupfer meditated.--"I was told the name of the piece ... a young girl who has been betrayed
appears in it.... It must be some drama or other. Clara was born for dramatic parts. Her very
appearance.... But where art thou going?" Kupfer interrupted himself, perceiving that Arátoff
was picking up his cap.

"I do not feel quite well," replied Arátoff. "Good-bye.... I will drop in some other time."

Kupfer held him back and looked him in the face.--"What a nervous fellow thou art, brother!
Just look at thyself.... Thou hast turned as white as clay."

"I do not feel well," repeated Arátoff, freeing himself from Kupfer's hands and going his way.
Only at that moment did it become clear to him that he had gone to Kupfer with the sole object
of talking about Clara....

"About foolish, about unhappy Clara"....

But on reaching home he speedily recovered his composure to a certain extent.

The circumstances which had attended Clara's death at first exerted a shattering impression
upon him ... but later on that acting "with the poison inside her," as Kupfer had expressed
it, seemed to him a monstrous phrase, a piece of bravado, and he tried not to think of it,
fearing to arouse within himself a feeling akin to aversion. But at dinner, as he sat opposite
Platósha, he suddenly remembered her nocturnal apparition, recalled that bob-tailed wrapper,
that cap with the tall ribbon (and why should there be a ribbon on a night-cap?), the whole
of that ridiculous figure, at which all his visions had dispersed into dust, as though at the
whistle of the machinist in a fantastic ballet! He even made Platósha repeat the tale of how
she had heard him shout, had taken fright, had leaped out of bed, had not been able at once
to find either her own door or his, and so forth. In the evening he played cards with her and
went off to his own room in a somewhat sad but fairly tranquil state of mind.

Arátoff did not think about the coming night, and did not fear it; he was convinced that he
should pass it in the best possible manner. The thought of Clara awoke in him from time to
time; but he immediately remembered that she had killed herself in a "spectacular" manner,
and turned away. That "outrageous" act prevented other memories from rising in him. Giving
a cursory glance at the stereoscope it seemed to him that she was looking to one side because
she felt ashamed. Directly over the stereoscope on the wall, hung the portrait of his mother.
Arátoff removed it from its nail, kissed it, and carefully put it away in a drawer. Why did
he do this? Because that portrait must not remain in the vicinity of that woman ... or for
some other reason--Arátoff did not quite know. But his mother's portrait evoked in him memories
of his father ... of that father whom he had seen dying in that same room, on that very bed.
"What dost thou think about all this, father?" he mentally addressed him. "Thou didst understand
all this; thou didst also believe in Schiller's world of spirits.--Give me counsel!"

"My father has given me counsel to drop all these follies," said Arátoff aloud, and took up
a book. But he was not able to read long, and feeling a certain heaviness all through his body,
he went to bed earlier than usual, in the firm conviction that he should fall asleep immediately.

And so it came about ... but his hopes for a peaceful night were not realised.

XVII

Before the clock struck midnight he had a remarkable, a menacing dream.

It seemed to him that he was in a sumptuous country-house of which he was the owner. He had
recently purchased the house, and all the estates attached to it. And he kept thinking: "It
is well, now it is well, but disaster is coming!" Beside him was hovering a tiny little man,
his manager; this man kept making obeisances, and trying to demonstrate to Arátoff how admirably
everything about his house and estate was arranged.--"Please, please look," he kept reiterating,
grinning at every word, "how everything is flourishing about you! Here are horses ... what
magnificent horses!" And Arátoff saw a row of huge horses. They were standing with their backs
to him, in stalls; they had wonderful manes and tails ... but as soon as Arátoff walked past
them the horses turned their heads toward him and viciously displayed their teeth.

"It is well," thought Arátoff, "but disaster is coming!"

"Please, please," repeated his manager again; "please come into the garden; see what splendid
apples we have!"

The apples really were splendid, red, and round; but as soon as Arátoff looked at them, they
began to shrivel and fall.... "Disaster is coming!" he thought.

"And here is the lake," murmurs the manager: "how blue and smooth it is! And here is a little
golden boat!... Would you like to have a sail in it?... It moves of itself."

"I will not get into it!" thought Arátoff; "a disaster is coming!" and nevertheless he did
seat himself in the boat. On the bottom, writhing, lay a little creature resembling an ape;
in its paws it was holding a phial filled with a dark liquid.

"Pray do not feel alarmed," shouted the manager from the shore.... "That is nothing! That is
death! A prosperous journey!"

The boat darted swiftly onward ... but suddenly a hurricane arose, not like the one of the
day before, soft and noiseless--no; it is a black, terrible, howling hurricane!--Everything
is in confusion round about;--and amid the swirling gloom Arátoff beholds Clara in theatrical
costume: she is raising the phial to her lips, a distant "Bravo! bravo!" is audible, and a
coarse voice shouts in Arátoff's ear:

"Ah! And didst thou think that all this would end in a comedy?--No! it is a tragedy! a tragedy!"

Arátoff awoke all in a tremble. It was not dark in the room.... A faint and melancholy light
streamed from somewhere or other, impassively illuminating all objects. Arátoff did not try
to account to himself for the light.... He felt but one thing: Clara was there in that room
... he felt her presence ... he was again and forever in her power!

A shriek burst from his lips: "Clara, art thou here?"

"Yes!" rang out clearly in the middle of the room illuminated with the motionless light.

Arátoff doubly repeated his question....

"Yes!" was audible once more.

"Then I want to see thee!" he cried, springing out of bed.

For several moments he stood in one spot, treading the cold floor with his bare feet. His eyes
roved: "But where? Where?" whispered his lips....

Nothing was to be seen or heard.

He looked about him, and noticed that the faint light which filled the room proceeded from
a night-light, screened by a sheet of paper, and placed in one corner, probably by Platósha
while he was asleep. He even detected the odour of incense also, in all probability, the work
of her hands.

He hastily dressed himself. Remaining in bed, sleeping, was not to be thought of.--Then he
took up his stand in the centre of the room and folded his arms. The consciousness of Clara's
presence was stronger than ever within him.

And now he began to speak, in a voice which was not loud, but with the solemn deliberation
wherewith exorcisms are uttered:

"Clara,"--thus did he begin,--"if thou art really here, if thou seest me, if thou hearest me,
reveal thyself!... If that power which I feel upon me is really thy power,--reveal thyself!
If thou understandest how bitterly I repent of not having understood thee, of having repulsed
thee,--reveal thyself!--If that which I have heard is really thy voice; if the feeling which
has taken possession of me is love; if thou art now convinced that I love thee,--I who up to
this time have not loved, and have not known a single woman;--if thou knowest that after thy
death I fell passionately, irresistibly in love with thee, if thou dost not wish me to go mad--reveal
thyself!"

No sooner had Arátoff uttered this last word than he suddenly felt some one swiftly approach
him from behind, as on that occasion upon the boulevard--and lay a hand upon his shoulder.
He wheeled round--and saw no one. But the consciousness of her presence became so distinct,
so indubitable, that he cast another hasty glance behind him....

What was that?! In his arm-chair, a couple of paces from him, sat a woman all in black. Her
head was bent to one side, as in the stereoscope.... It was she! It was Clara! But what a stern,
what a mournful face!

Arátoff sank down gently upon his knees.--Yes, he was right, then; neither fear, nor joy was
in him, nor even surprise.... His heart even began to beat more quietly;--The only thing in
him was the feeling: "Ah! At last! At last!"

"Clara," he began in a faint but even tone, "why dost thou not look at me? I know it is thou
... but I might, seest thou, think that my imagination had created an image like that one...."
(He pointed in the direction of the stereoscope).... "Prove to me that it is thou.... Turn
toward me, look at me, Clara!"

Clara's hand rose slowly ... and fell again.

"Clara! Clara! Turn toward me!"

And Clara's head turned slowly, her drooping lids opened, and the dark pupils of her eyes were
fixed on Arátoff.

He started back, and uttered a tremulous, long-drawn: "Ah!"

Clara gazed intently at him ... but her eyes, her features preserved their original thoughtfully-stern,
almost displeased expression. With precisely that expression she had presented herself on the
platform upon the day of the literary morning, before she had caught sight of Arátoff. And
now, as on that occasion also, she suddenly flushed scarlet, her face grew animated, her glance
flashed, and a joyful, triumphant smile parted her lips....

"I am forgiven!"--cried Arátoff.--"Thou hast conquered.... So take me! For I am thine, and
thou art mine!"

He darted toward her, he tried to kiss those smiling, those triumphant lips,--and he did kiss
them, he felt their burning touch, he felt even the moist chill of her teeth, and a rapturous
cry rang through the half-dark room.

Platonída Ivánovna ran in and found him in a swoon. He was on his knees; his head was lying
on the arm-chair; his arms, outstretched before him, hung powerless; his pale face breathed
forth the intoxication of boundless happiness.

Platonída Ivánovna threw herself beside him, embraced him, stammered: "Yásha! Yáshenka! Yashenyónotchek!!"[67]
tried to lift him up with her bony arms ... he did not stir. Then Platonída Ivánovna set to
screaming in an unrecognisable voice. The maid-servant ran in. Together they managed somehow
to lift him up, seated him in a chair, and began to dash water on him--and water in which a
holy image had been washed at that....

He came to himself; but merely smiled in reply to his aunt's queries, and with such a blissful
aspect that she became more perturbed than ever, and kept crossing first him and then herself....
At last Arátoff pushed away her hand, and still with the same beatific expression on his countenance,
he said:--

"What is the matter with you, Platósha?"

"What ails thee, Yáshenka?"

"Me?--I am happy ... happy, Platósha ... that is what ails me. But now I want to go to bed
and sleep."

He tried to rise, but felt such a weakness in his legs and in all his body that he was not
in a condition to undress and get into bed himself without the aid of his aunt and of the maid-servant.
But he fell asleep very quickly, preserving on his face that same blissfully-rapturous expression.
Only his face was extremely pale.

XVIII

When Platonída Ivánovna entered his room on the following morning he was in the same condition
... but his weakness had not passed off, and he even preferred to remain in bed. Platonída
Ivánovna did not like the pallor of his face in particular.

"What does it mean, O Lord!" she thought. "There isn't a drop of blood in his face, he refuses
his beef-tea; he lies there and laughs, and keeps asserting that he is quite well!"

He refused breakfast also.--"Why dost thou do that, Yásha?" she asked him; "dost thou intend
to lie like this all day?"

"And what if I do?" replied Arátoff, affectionately.

This very affection also did not please Platonída Ivánovna. Arátoff wore the aspect of a man
who has learned a great secret, which is very agreeable to him, and is jealously clinging to
it and reserving it for himself. He was waiting for night, not exactly with impatience but
with curiosity.

"What comes next?" he asked himself;--"what will happen?" He had ceased to be surprised, to
be perplexed; he cherished no doubt as to his having entered into communication with Clara;
that they loved each other ... he did not doubt, either. Only ... what can come of such a love?--He
recalled that kiss ... and a wondrous chill coursed swiftly and sweetly through all his limbs.--"Romeo
and Juliet did not exchange such a kiss as that!" he thought. "But the next time I shall hold
out better.... I shall possess her.... She will come with the garland of tiny roses in her
black curls....

"But after that what? For we cannot live together, can we? Consequently I must die in order
to be with her? Was not that what she came for,--and is it not in that way she wishes to take me?

"Well, and what of that? If I must die, I must. Death does not terrify me in the least now.
For it cannot annihilate me, can it? On the contrary, only thus and there shall I be happy
... as I have never been happy in my lifetime, as she has never been in hers.... For we are
both unsullied!--Oh, that kiss!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Platonída Ivánovna kept entering Arátoff's room; she did not worry him with questions, she
merely took a look at him, whispered, sighed, and went out again.--But now he refused his dinner
also.... Things were getting quite too bad. The old woman went off to her friend, the medical
man of the police-district, in whom she had faith simply because he did not drink and was married
to a German woman. Arátoff was astonished when she brought the man to him; but Platonída Ivánovna
began so insistently to entreat her Yáshenka to permit Paramón Paramónitch (that was the medical
man's name) to examine him--come, now, just for her sake!--that Arátoff consented. Paramón
Paramónitch felt his pulse, looked at his tongue, interrogated him after a fashion, and finally
announced that it was indispensably necessary to "auscultate" him. Arátoff was in such a submissive
frame of mind that he consented to this also. The doctor delicately laid bare his breast, delicately
tapped it, listened, smiled, prescribed some drops and a potion, but chief of all, advised
him to be quiet, and refrain from violent emotions.

"You don't say so!" thought Arátoff.... "Well, brother, thou hast bethought thyself too late!"

"What ails Yásha?" asked Platonída Ivánovna, as she handed Paramón Paramónitch a three-ruble
bank-note on the threshold. The district doctor, who, like all contemporary doctors,--especially
those of them who wear a uniform,--was fond of showing off his learned terminology, informed
her that her nephew had all the dioptric symptoms of nervous cardialgia, and that febris was
present also.

"But speak more simply, dear little father," broke in Platonída Ivánovna; "don't scare me with
Latin; thou art not in an apothecary's shop!"

"His heart is out of order," explained the doctor;--"well, and he has fever also," ... and
he repeated his advice with regard to repose and moderation.

"But surely there is no danger?" sternly inquired Platonída Ivánovna, as much as to say: "Look
out and don't try your Latin on me again!"

"Not at present!"

The doctor went away, and Platonída Ivánovna took to grieving.... Nevertheless she sent to
the apothecary for the medicine, which Arátoff would not take, despite her entreaties. He even
refused herb-tea.

"What makes you worry so, dear?" he said to her. "I assure you I am now the most perfectly
healthy and happy man in the whole world!"

Platonída Ivánovna merely shook her head. Toward evening he became slightly feverish; yet he
still insisted upon it that she should not remain in his room, and should go away to her own
to sleep. Platonída Ivánovna obeyed, but did not undress, and did not go to bed; she sat up
in an arm-chair and kept listening and whispering her prayer.

She was beginning to fall into a doze, when suddenly a dreadful, piercing shriek awakened her.
She sprang to her feet, rushed into Arátoff's study, and found him lying on the floor, as upon
the night before.

But he did not come to himself as he had done the night before, work over him as they would.
That night he was seized with a high fever, complicated by inflammation of the heart.

A few days later he died.

A strange circumstance accompanied his second swoon. When they lifted him up and put him to
bed, there proved to be a small lock of woman's black hair clutched in his right hand. Where
had that hair come from? Anna Semyónovna had such a lock, which she had kept after Clara's
death; but why should she have given to Arátoff an object which was so precious to her? Could
she have laid it into the diary, and not noticed the fact when she gave him the book?

In the delirium which preceded his death Arátoff called himself Romeo ... after the poison;
he talked about a marriage contracted, consummated;--said that now he knew the meaning of delight.
Especially dreadful for Platonída Ivánovna was the moment when Arátoff, recovering consciousness,
and seeing her by his bedside, said to her:

"Aunty, why art thou weeping? Is it because I must die? But dost thou not know that love is
stronger than death?... Death! O Death, where is thy sting? Thou must not weep, but rejoice,
even as I rejoice...."

And again the face of the dying man beamed with that same blissful smile which had made the
poor old woman shudder so.

POEMS IN PROSE

(1878-1882)

From the Editor of the "European Messenger"

In compliance with our request, Iván Sergyéevitch Turgénieff has given his consent to our sharing
now with the readers of our journal, without delay, those passing comments, thoughts, images
which he had noted down, under one impression or another of current existence, during the last
five years,--those which belong to him personally, and those which pertain to society in general.
They, like many others, have not found a place in those finished productions of the past which
have already been presented to the world, and have formed a complete collection in themselves.
From among these the author has made fifty selections.

In the letter accompanying the pages which we are now about to print, I. S. Turgénieff says,
in conclusion:

"... Let not your reader peruse these 'Poems in Prose' at one sitting; he will probably be
bored, and the book will fall from his hands. But let him read them separately,--to-day one,
to-morrow another,--and then perchance some one of them may leave some trace behind in his
soul...."

The pages have no general title; the author has written on their wrapper: "Senilia--An Old
Man's Jottings,"--but we have preferred the words carelessly dropped by the author in the end
of his letter to us, quoted above,--"Poems in Prose"--and we print the pages under that general
title. In our opinion, it fully expresses the source from which such comments might present
themselves to the soul of an author well known for his sensitiveness to the various questions
of life, as well as the impression which they may produce on the reader, "leaving behind in
his soul" many things. They are, in reality, poems in spite of the fact that they are written
in prose. We place them in chronological order, beginning with the year 1878.

I

(1878)

THE VILLAGE

The last day of July; for a thousand versts round about lies Russia, the fatherland.

The whole sky is suffused with an even azure; there is only one little cloud in it, which is
half floating, half melting. There is no wind, it is warm ... the air is like new milk!

Larks are carolling; large-cropped pigeons are cooing; the swallows dart past in silence; the
horses neigh and munch, the dogs do not bark, but stand peaceably wagging their tails.

And there is an odour of smoke abroad, and of grass,--and a tiny whiff of tan,--and another
of leather.--The hemp-patches, also, are in their glory, and emit their heavy but agreeable
fragrance.

A deep but not long ravine. Along its sides, in several rows, grow bulky-headed willows, stripped
bare at the bottom. Through the ravine runs a brook; on its bottom tiny pebbles seem to tremble
athwart its pellucid ripples.--Far away, at the spot where the rims of earth and sky come together,
is the bluish streak of a large river.

Along the ravine, on one side are neat little storehouses, and buildings with tightly-closed
doors; on the other side are five or six pine-log cottages with board roofs. Over each roof
rises a tall pole with a starling house; over each tiny porch is an openwork iron horse's head
with a stiff mane.[69] The uneven window-panes sparkle with the hues of the rainbow. Jugs holding
bouquets are painted on the shutters. In front of each cottage stands sedately a precise little
bench; on the earthen banks around the foundations of the house cats lie curled in balls, with
their transparent ears pricked up on the alert; behind the lofty thresholds the anterooms look
dark and cool.

I am lying on the very brink of the ravine, on an outspread horse-cloth; round about are whole
heaps of new-mown hay, which is fragrant to the point of inducing faintness. The sagacious
householders have spread out the hay in front of their cottages: let it dry a little more in
the hot sun, and then away with it to the barn! It will be a glorious place for a nap!

The curly heads of children project from each haycock; crested hens are searching in the hay
for gnats and small beetles; a white-toothed puppy is sprawling among the tangled blades of grass.

Ruddy-curled youths in clean, low-girt shirts, and heavy boots with borders, are bandying lively
remarks as they stand with their breasts resting on the unhitched carts, and display their
teeth in a grin.

From a window a round-faced lass peeps out; she laughs, partly at their words, and partly at
the pranks of the children in the heaped-up hay.

Another lass with her sturdy arms is drawing a huge, dripping bucket from the well.... The
bucket trembles and rocks on the rope, scattering long, fiery drops.

In front of me stands an aged housewife in a new-checked petticoat of homespun and new peasant-shoes.

Large inflated beads in three rows encircle her thin, swarthy neck; her grey hair is bound
about with a yellow kerchief with red dots; it droops low over her dimmed eyes.

But her aged eyes smile in cordial wise; her whole wrinkled face smiles. The old woman must
be in her seventh decade ... and even now it can be seen that she was a beauty in her day!

With the sunburned fingers of her right hand widely spread apart, she holds a pot of cool,
unskimmed milk, straight from the cellar; the sides of the pot are covered with dewdrops, like
small pearl beads. On the palm of her left hand the old woman offers me a big slice of bread
still warm from the oven. As much as to say: "Eat, and may health be thine, thou passing guest!"

A cock suddenly crows and busily flaps his wings; an imprisoned calf lows without haste, in reply.

"Hey, what fine oats!" the voice of my coachman makes itself heard....

O Russian contentment, repose, plenty! O free village! O tranquillity and abundance!

And I thought to myself: "What care we for the cross on the dome of Saint Sophia in Constantinople,
and all the other things for which we strive, we people of the town?"

February, 1878.

A CONVERSATION

     "Never yet has human foot trod either the
     Jungfrau or the Finsteraarhorn."

The summits of the Alps.... A whole chain of steep cliffs.... The very heart of the mountains.

Overhead a bright, mute, pale-green sky. A hard, cruel frost; firm, sparkling snow; from beneath
the snow project grim blocks of ice-bound, wind-worn cliffs.

Two huge masses, two giants rise aloft, one on each side of the horizon: the Jungfrau and the
Finsteraarhorn.

And the Jungfrau says to its neighbour: "What news hast thou to tell? Thou canst see better.--What
is going on there below?"

Several thousand years pass by like one minute. And the Finsteraarhorn rumbles in reply: "Dense
clouds veil the earth.... Wait!"

More thousands of years elapse, as it were one minute.

"Well, what now?" inquires the Jungfrau.

"Now I can see; down yonder, below, everything is still the same: party-coloured, tiny. The
waters gleam blue; the forests are black; heaps of stones piled up shine grey. Around them
small beetles are still bustling,--thou knowest, those two-legged beetles who have as yet been
unable to defile either thou or me."

"Men?"

"Yes, men."

Thousands of years pass, as it were one minute.

"Well, and what now?" asks the Jungfrau.

"I seem to see fewer of the little beetles," thunders the Finsteraarhorn. "Things have become
clearer down below; the waters have contracted; the forests have grown thinner."

More thousands of years pass, as it were one minute.

"What dost thou see?" says the Jungfrau.

"Things seem to have grown clearer round us, close at hand," replies the Finsteraarhorn; "well,
and yonder, far away, in the valleys there is still a spot, and something is moving."

"And now?" inquires the Jungfrau, after other thousands of years, which are as one minute.

"Now it is well," replies the Finsteraarhorn; "it is clean everywhere, quite white, wherever
one looks.... Everywhere is our snow, level snow and ice. Everything is congealed. It is well
now, and calm."

"Good," said the Jungfrau.--"But thou and I have chattered enough, old fellow. It is time to
sleep."

"It is time!"

The huge mountains slumber; the green, clear heaven slumbers over the earth which has grown
dumb forever.

February, 1878.

THE OLD WOMAN

I was walking across a spacious field, alone.

And suddenly I thought I heard light, cautious footsteps behind my back.... Some one was following
me.

I glanced round and beheld a tiny, bent old woman, all enveloped in grey rags. The old woman's
face was visible from beneath them: a yellow, wrinkled, sharp-nosed, toothless face.

I stepped up to her.... She halted.

"Who art thou? What dost thou want? Art thou a beggar? Dost thou expect alms?"

The old woman made no answer. I bent down to her and perceived that both her eyes were veiled
with a semi-transparent, whitish membrane or film, such as some birds have; therewith they
protect their eyes from too brilliant a light.

But in the old woman's case that film did not move and reveal the pupils ... from which I inferred
that she was blind.

"Dost thou want alms?" I repeated my question.--"Why art thou following me?"--But, as before,
the old woman did not answer, and merely shrank back almost imperceptibly.

I turned from her and went my way.

And lo! again I hear behind me those same light, measured footsteps which seem to be creeping
stealthily up.

"There's that woman again!" I said to myself.--"Why has she attached herself to me?"--But at
this point I mentally added: "Probably, owing to her blindness, she has lost her way, and now
she is guiding herself by the sound of my steps, in order to come out, in company with me,
at some inhabited place. Yes, yes; that is it."

But a strange uneasiness gradually gained possession of my thoughts: it began to seem to me
as though that old woman were not only following me, but were guiding me,--that she was thrusting
me now to the right, now to the left, and that I was involuntarily obeying her.

Still I continue to walk on ... but now, in front of me, directly in my road, something looms
up black and expands ... some sort of pit.... "The grave!" flashes through my mind.--"That
is where she is driving me!"

I wheel abruptly round. Again the old woman is before me ... but she sees! She gazes at me
with large, evil eyes which bode me ill ... the eyes of a bird of prey.... I bend down to her
face, to her eyes.... Again there is the same film, the same blind, dull visage as before....

"Akh!" I think ... "this old woman is my Fate--that Fate which no man can escape!

"I cannot get away! I cannot get away!--What madness.... I must make an effort." And I dart
to one side, in a different direction.

I advance briskly.... But the light footsteps, as before, rustle behind me, close, close behind
me.... And in front of me again the pit yawns.

Again I turn in another direction.... And again there is the same rustling behind me, the same
menacing spot in front of me.

And no matter in what direction I dart, like a hare pursued ... it is always the same, the same!

"Stay!" I think.--"I will cheat her! I will not go anywhere at all!"--and I instantaneously
sit down on the ground.

The old woman stands behind me, two paces distant.--I do not hear her, but I feel that she
is there.

And suddenly I behold that spot which had loomed black in the distance, gliding on, creeping
up to me itself!

O God! I glance behind me.... The old woman is looking straight at me, and her toothless mouth
is distorted in a grin....

"Thou canst not escape!"

February, 1878.

THE DOG

There are two of us in the room, my dog and I.... A frightful storm is raging out of doors.

The dog is sitting in front of me, and gazing straight into my eyes.

And I, also, am looking him straight in the eye.

He seems to be anxious to say something to me. He is dumb, he has no words, he does not understand
himself--but I understand him.

I understand that, at this moment, both in him and in me there dwells one and the same feeling,
that there is no difference whatever between us. We are exactly alike; in each of us there
burns and glows the selfsame tremulous flame.

Death is swooping down upon us, it is waving its cold, broad wings....

"And this is the end!"

Who shall decide afterward, precisely what sort of flame burned in each one of us?

No! it is not an animal and a man exchanging glances....

It is two pairs of eyes exactly alike fixed on each other.

And in each of those pairs, in the animal and in the man, one and the same life is huddling
up timorously to the other.

February, 1878.

THE RIVAU

I had a comrade-rival; not in our studies, not in the service or in love; but our views did
not agree on any point, and every time we met, interminable arguments sprang up.

We argued about art, religion, science, about the life of earth and matters beyond the grave,--especially
life beyond the grave.

He was a believer and an enthusiast. One day he said to me: "Thou laughest at everything; but
if I die before thee, I will appear to thee from the other world.... We shall see whether thou
wilt laugh then."

And, as a matter of fact, he did die before me, while he was still young in years; but years
passed, and I had forgotten his promise,--his threat.

One night I was lying in bed, and could not get to sleep, neither did I wish to do so.

It was neither light nor dark in the room; I began to stare into the grey half-gloom.

And suddenly it seemed to me that my rival was standing between the two windows, and nodding
his head gently and sadly downward from above.

I was not frightened, I was not even surprised ... but rising up slightly in bed, and propping
myself on my elbow, I began to gaze with redoubled attention at the figure which had so unexpectedly
presented itself.

The latter continued to nod its head.

"What is it?" I said at last.--"Art thou exulting? Or art thou pitying?--What is this--a warning
or a reproach?... Or dost thou wish to give me to understand that thou wert in the wrong? That
we were both in the wrong? What art thou experiencing? The pains of hell? The bliss of paradise?
Speak at least one word!"

But my rival did not utter a single sound--and only went on nodding his head sadly and submissively,
as before, downward from above.

I burst out laughing ... he vanished.

THE BEGGAR MAN

I was passing along the street when a beggar, a decrepit old man, stopped me.

Swollen, tearful eyes, blue lips, bristling rags, unclean sores.... Oh, how horribly had poverty
gnawed that unhappy being!

He stretched out to me a red, bloated, dirty hand.... He moaned, he bellowed for help.

I began to rummage in all my pockets.... Neither purse, nor watch, nor even handkerchief did
I find.... I had taken nothing with me.

And the beggar still waited ... and extended his hand, which swayed and trembled feebly.

Bewildered, confused, I shook that dirty, tremulous hand heartily....

"Blame me not, brother; I have nothing, brother."

The beggar man fixed his swollen eyes upon me; his blue lips smiled--and in his turn he pressed
my cold fingers.

"Never mind, brother," he mumbled. "Thanks for this also, brother.--This also is an alms, brother."

I understood that I had received an alms from my brother.

"THOU SHALT HEAR THE JUDGMENT OF THE DULLARD...."
                                              Púshkin

"Thou shalt hear the judgment of the dullard...." Thou hast always spoken the truth, thou great
writer of ours; thou hast spoken it this time, also.

"The judgment of the dullard and the laughter of the crowd."... Who is there that has not experienced
both the one and the other?

All this can--and must be borne; and whosoever hath the strength,--let him despise it.

But there are blows which beat more painfully on the heart itself.... A man has done everything
in his power; he has toiled arduously, lovingly, honestly.... And honest souls turn squeamishly
away from him; honest faces flush with indignation at his name. "Depart! Begone!" honest young
voices shout at him.--"We need neither thee nor thy work, thou art defiling our dwelling--thou
dost not know us and dost not understand us.... Thou art our enemy!"

What is that man to do then? Continue to toil, make no effort to defend himself--and not even
expect a more just estimate.

In former days tillers of the soil cursed the traveller who brought them potatoes in place
of bread, the daily food of the poor man.... They snatched the precious gift from the hands
outstretched to them, flung it in the mire, trod it under foot.

Now they subsist upon it--and do not even know the name of their benefactor.

So be it! What matters his name to them? He, although he be nameless, has saved them from hunger.

Let us strive only that what we offer may be equally useful food.

Bitter is unjust reproach in the mouths of people whom one loves.... But even that can be endured....

"Beat me--but hear me out!" said the Athenian chieftain to the Spartan chieftain.

"Beat me--but be healthy and full fed!" is what we ought to say.

February, 1878.

THE CONTENTED MAN

Along a street of the capital is skipping a man who is still young.--His movements are cheerful,
alert; his eyes are beaming, his lips are smiling, his sensitive face is pleasantly rosy....
He is all contentment and joy.

What has happened to him? Has he come into an inheritance? Has he been elevated in rank? Is
he hastening to a love tryst? Or, simply, has he breakfasted well, and is it a sensation of
health, a sensation of full-fed strength which is leaping for joy in all his limbs? Or they
may have hung on his neck thy handsome, eight-pointed cross, O Polish King Stanislaus!

No. He has concocted a calumny against an acquaintance, he has assiduously disseminated it,
he has heard it--that same calumny--from the mouth of another acquaintance--and has believed
it himself.

Oh, how contented, how good even at this moment is that nice, highly-promising young man.

THE RULE OF LIFE

"If you desire thoroughly to mortify and even to injure an opponent," said an old swindler
to me, "reproach him with the very defect or vice of which you feel conscious in yourself.--Fly
into a rage ... and reproach him!

"In the first place, that makes other people think that you do not possess that vice.

"In the second place, your wrath may even be sincere.... You may profit by the reproaches of
your own conscience.

"If, for example, you are a renegade, reproach your adversary with having no convictions!

"If you yourself are a lackey in soul, say to him with reproof that he is a lackey ... the
lackey of civilisation, of Europe, of socialism!"

"You may even say, the lackey of non-lackeyism!" I remarked.

"You may do that also," chimed in the old rascal.

THE END OF THE WORLD

A DREAM

It seems to me as though I am somewhere in Russia, in the wilds, in a plain country house.

The chamber is large, low-ceiled, with three windows; the walls are smeared with white paint;
there is no furniture. In front of the house is a bare plain; gradually descending, it recedes
into the distance; the grey, monotoned sky hangs over it like a canopy.

I am not alone; half a score of men are with me in the room. All plain folk, plainly clad;
they are pacing up and down in silence, as though by stealth. They avoid one another, and yet
they are incessantly exchanging uneasy glances.

Not one of them knows why he has got into this house, or who the men are with him. On all faces
there is disquiet and melancholy ... all, in turn, approach the windows and gaze attentively
about them, as though expecting something from without.

Then again they set to roaming up and down. Among us a lad of short stature is running about;
from time to time he screams in a shrill, monotonous voice: "Daddy, I'm afraid!"--This shrill
cry makes me sick at heart--and I also begin to be afraid.... Of what? I myself do not know.
Only I feel that a great, great calamity is on its way, and is drawing near.

And the little lad keeps screaming. Akh, if I could only get away from here! How stifling it
is! How oppressive!... But it is impossible to escape.

That sky is like a shroud. And there is no wind.... Is the air dead?

Suddenly the boy ran to the window and began to scream with the same plaintive voice as usual:
"Look! Look! The earth has fallen in!"

"What? Fallen in?"--In fact: there had been a plain in front of the house, but now the house
is standing on the crest of a frightful mountain!--The horizon has fallen, has gone down, and
from the very house itself a black, almost perpendicular declivity descends.

We have all thronged to the window.... Horror freezes our hearts.--"There it is ... there it
is!" whispers my neighbour.

And lo! along the whole distant boundary of the earth something has begun to stir, some small,
round hillocks have begun to rise and fall.

"It is the sea!" occurs to us all at one and the same moment.--"It will drown us all directly....
Only, how can it wax and rise up? On that precipice?"

And nevertheless it does wax, and wax hugely.... It is no longer separate hillocks which are
tumbling in the distance.... A dense, monstrous wave engulfs the entire circle of the horizon.

It is flying, flying upon us!--Like an icy hurricane it sweeps on, swirling with the outer
darkness. Everything round about has begun to quiver,--and yonder, in that oncoming mass,--there
are crashing and thunder, and a thousand-throated, iron barking....

Ha! What a roaring and howling! It is the earth roaring with terror....

It is the end of it! The end of all things!

The boy screamed once more.... I tried to seize hold of my comrades, but we, all of us, were
already crushed, buried, drowned, swept away by that icy, rumbling flood, as black as ink.

Darkness ... eternal darkness!

Gasping for breath, I awoke.

March, 1878.

MASHA

When I was living in Petersburg,--many years ago,--whenever I had occasion to hire a public
cabman I entered into conversation with him.

I was specially fond of conversing with the night cabmen,--poor peasants of the suburbs, who
have come to town with their ochre-tinted little sledges and miserable little nags in the hope
of supporting themselves and collecting enough money to pay their quit-rent to their owners.

So, then, one day I hired such a cabman.... He was a youth of twenty years, tall, well-built,
a fine, dashing young fellow; he had blue eyes and rosy cheeks; his red-gold hair curled in
rings beneath a wretched little patched cap, which was pulled down over his very eyebrows.
And how in the world was that tattered little coat ever got upon those shoulders of heroic mould!

But the cabman's handsome, beardless face seemed sad and lowering.

I entered into conversation with him. Sadness was discernible in his voice also.

"What is it, brother?" I asked him.--"Why art not thou cheerful? Hast thou any grief?"

The young fellow did not reply to me at once.

"I have, master, I have," he said at last.--"And such a grief that it would be better if I
were not alive. My wife is dead."

"Didst thou love her ... thy wife?"

The young fellow turned toward me; only he bent his head a little.

"I did, master. This is the eighth month since ... but I cannot forget. It is eating away my
heart ... so it is! And why must she die? She was young! Healthy!... In one day the cholera
settled her."

"And was she of a good disposition?"

"Akh, master!" sighed the poor fellow, heavily.--"And on what friendly terms she and I lived
together! She died in my absence. When I heard here that they had already buried her, I hurried
immediately to the village, home. It was already after midnight when I arrived. I entered my
cottage, stopped short in the middle of it, and said so softly: 'Masha! hey, Masha!' Only a
cricket shrilled.--Then I fell to weeping, and sat down on the cottage floor, and how I did
beat my palm against the ground!--'Thy bowels are insatiable!' I said.... 'Thou hast devoured
her ... devour me also!'--Akh, Masha!"

"Masha," he added in a suddenly lowered voice. And without letting his rope reins out of his
hands, he squeezed a tear out of his eye with his mitten, shook it off, flung it to one side,
shrugged his shoulders--and did not utter another word.

As I alighted from the sledge I gave him an extra fifteen kopéks. He made me a low obeisance,
grasping his cap in both hands, and drove off at a foot-pace over the snowy expanse of empty
street, flooded with the grey mist of the January frost.

April, 1878.

THE FOOL

Once upon a time a fool lived in the world.

For a long time he lived in clover; but gradually rumours began to reach him to the effect
that he bore the reputation everywhere of a brainless ninny.

The fool was disconcerted and began to fret over the question how he was to put an end to those
unpleasant rumours.

A sudden idea at last illumined his dark little brain.... And without the slightest delay he
put it into execution.

An acquaintance met him on the street and began to praise a well-known artist.... "Good gracious!"
exclaimed the fool, "that artist was relegated to the archives long ago.... Don't you know
that?--I did not expect that of you.... You are behind the times."

The acquaintance was frightened, and immediately agreed with the fool.

"What a fine book I have read to-day!" said another acquaintance to him.

"Good gracious!" cried the fool.--"Aren't you ashamed of yourself? That book is good for nothing;
everybody dropped it in disgust long ago.--Don't you know that?--You are behind the times."

And that acquaintance also was frightened and agreed with the fool.

"What a splendid man my friend N. N. is!" said a third acquaintance to the fool.--"There's
a truly noble being for you!"

"Good gracious!"--exclaimed the fool,--"it is well known that N. N. is a scoundrel! He has
robbed all his relatives. Who is there that does not know it? You are behind the times."

The third acquaintance also took fright and agreed with the fool, and renounced his friend.
And whosoever or whatsoever was praised in the fool's presence, he had the same retort for all.

He even sometimes added reproachfully: "And do you still believe in the authorities?"

"A malicious person! A bilious man!" his acquaintances began to say about the fool.--"But what
a head!"

"And what a tongue!" added others.

"Oh, yes; he is talented!"

It ended in the publisher of a newspaper proposing to the fool that he should take charge of
his critical department.

And the fool began to criticise everything and everybody, without making the slightest change
in his methods, or in his exclamations.

Now he, who formerly shrieked against authorities, is an authority himself,--and the young
men worship him and fear him.

But what are they to do, poor fellows? Although it is not proper--generally speaking--to worship
... yet in this case, if one does not do it, he will find himself classed among the men who
are behind the times!

There is a career for fools among cowards.

AN ORIENTAL LEGEND

Who in Bagdad does not know the great Giaffar, the sun of the universe?

One day, many years ago, when he was still a young man, Giaffar was strolling in the suburbs
of Bagdad.

Suddenly there fell upon his ear a hoarse cry: some one was calling desperately for help.

Giaffar was distinguished among the young men of his own age for his good sense and prudence;
but he had a compassionate heart, and he trusted to his strength.

He ran in the direction of the cry, and beheld a decrepit old man pinned against the wall of
the city by two brigands who were robbing him.

Giaffar drew his sword and fell upon the malefactors. One he slew, the other he chased away.

The old man whom he had liberated fell at his rescuer's feet, and kissing the hem of his garment,
exclaimed: "Brave youth, thy magnanimity shall not remain unrewarded. In appearance I am a
beggar; but only in appearance. I am not a common man.--Come to-morrow morning early to the
chief bazaar; I will await thee there at the fountain--and thou shalt convince thyself as to
the justice of my words."

Giaffar reflected: "In appearance this man is a beggar, it is true; but all sorts of things
happen. Why should not I try the experiment?"--and he answered: "Good, my father, I will go."

The old man looked him in the eye and went away.

On the following morning, just as day was breaking, Giaffar set out for the bazaar. The old
man was already waiting for him, with his elbows leaning on the marble basin of the fountain.

Silently he took Giaffar by the hand and led him to a small garden, surrounded on all sides
by high walls.

In the very centre of this garden, on a green lawn, grew a tree of extraordinary aspect.

It resembled a cypress; only its foliage was of azure hue.

Three fruits--three apples--hung on the slender up-curving branches. One of medium size was
oblong in shape, of a milky-white hue; another was large, round, and bright red; the third
was small, wrinkled and yellowish.

The whole tree was rustling faintly, although there was no wind. It tinkled delicately and
plaintively, as though it were made of glass; it seemed to feel the approach of Giaffar.

"Youth!"--said the old man, "pluck whichever of these fruits thou wilt, and know that if thou
shalt pluck and eat the white one, thou shalt become more wise than all men; if thou shalt
pluck and eat the red one, thou shalt become as rich as the Hebrew Rothschild; if thou shalt
pluck and eat the yellow one, thou shalt please old women. Decide! ... and delay not. In an
hour the fruits will fade, and the tree itself will sink into the dumb depths of the earth!"

Giaffar bowed his head and thought.--"What am I to do?" he articulated in a low tone, as though
arguing with himself.--"If one becomes too wise, he will not wish to live, probably; if he
becomes richer than all men, all will hate him; I would do better to pluck and eat the third,
the shrivelled apple!"

And so he did; and the old man laughed a toothless laugh and said: "Oh, most wise youth! Thou
hast chosen the good part!--What use hast thou for the white apple? Thou art wiser than Solomon
as thou art.--And neither dost thou need the red apple.... Even without it thou shalt be rich.
Only no one will be envious of thy wealth."

"Inform me, old man," said Giaffar, with a start, "where the respected mother of our God-saved
Caliph dwelleth?"

The old man bowed to the earth, and pointed out the road to the youth.

Who in Bagdad doth not know the sun of the universe, the great, the celebrated Giaffar?

April, 1878.

TWO FOUR-LINE STANZAS

There existed once a city whose inhabitants were so passionately fond of poetry that if several
weeks passed and no beautiful new verses had made their appearance they regarded that poetical
dearth as a public calamity.

At such times they donned their worst garments, sprinkled ashes on their heads, and gathering
in throngs on the public squares, they shed tears, and murmured bitterly against the Muse for
having abandoned them.

On one such disastrous day the young poet Junius, presented himself on the square, filled to
overflowing with the sorrowing populace.

With swift steps he ascended a specially-constructed tribune and made a sign that he wished
to recite a poem.

The lictors immediately brandished their staves. "Silence! Attention!" they shouted in stentorian
tones.

"Friends! Comrades!" began Junius, in a loud, but not altogether firm voice:

    "Friends! Comrades! Ye lovers of verses!
    Admirers of all that is graceful and fair!
    Be not cast down by a moment of dark sadness!
    The longed-for instant will come ... and light
        will disperse the gloom!"[70]

Junius ceased speaking ... and in reply to him, from all points of the square, clamour, whistling,
and laughter arose.

All the faces turned toward him flamed with indignation, all eyes flashed with wrath, all hands
were uplifted, menaced, were clenched into fists.

"A pretty thing he has thought to surprise us with!" roared angry voices. "Away from the tribune
with the talentless rhymster! Away with the fool! Hurl rotten apples, bad eggs, at the empty-pated
idiot! Give us stones! Fetch stones!"

Junius tumbled headlong from the tribune ... but before he had succeeded in fleeing to his
own house, outbursts of rapturous applause, cries of laudation and shouts reached his ear.

Filled with amazement, but striving not to be detected (for it is dangerous to irritate an
enraged wild beast), Junius returned to the square.

And what did he behold?

High above the throng, above its shoulders, on a flat gold shield, stood his rival, the young
poet Julius, clad in a purple mantle, with a laurel wreath on his waving curls.... And the
populace round about was roaring: "Glory! Glory! Glory to the immortal Julius! He hath comforted
us in our grief, in our great woe! He hath given us verses sweeter than honey, more melodious
than the cymbals, more fragrant than the rose, more pure than heaven's azure! Bear him in triumph;
surround his inspired head with a soft billow of incense; refresh his brow with the waving
of palm branches; lavish at his feet all the spices of Arabia! Glory!"

Junius approached one of the glorifiers.--"Inform me, O my fellow-townsman! With what verses
hath Julius made you happy?--Alas, I was not on the square when he recited them! Repeat them,
if thou canst recall them, I pray thee!"

"Such verses--and not recall them?" briskly replied the man interrogated.--"For whom dost thou
take me? Listen--and rejoice, rejoice together with us!"

'Ye lovers of verses!'--thus began the divine Julius....

    "'Ye lovers of verses! Comrades! Friends!
    Admirers of all that is graceful, melodious, tender!
    Be not east down by a moment of heavy grief!
    The longed-for moment will come--and day will chase away the night!'

"What dost thou think of that?"

"Good gracious!" roared Junius. "Why, those are my lines!--Julius must have been in the crowd
when I recited them; he heard and repeated them, barely altering--and that, of course, not
for the better--a few expressions!"

"Aha! Now I recognise thee.... Thou art Junius," retorted the citizen whom he had accosted,
knitting his brows.--"Thou art either envious or a fool!... Only consider just one thing, unhappy
man! Julius says in such lofty style: 'And day will chase away the night!'.... But with thee
it is some nonsense or other: 'And the light will disperse the gloom!?'--What light?! What
darkness?!"

"But is it not all one and the same thing...." Junius was beginning....

"Add one word more," the citizen interrupted him, "and I will shout to the populace, and it
will rend thee asunder."

Junius prudently held his peace, but a grey-haired old man, who had overheard his conversation
with the citizen, stepped up to the poor poet, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said:

"Junius! Thou hast said thy say at the wrong time; but the other man said his at the right
time.--consequently, he is in the right, while for thee there remain the consolations of thine
own conscience."

But while his conscience was consoling Junius to the best of its ability,--and in a decidedly-unsatisfactory
way, if the truth must be told,--far away, amid the thunder and patter of jubilation, in the
golden dust of the all-conquering sun, gleaming with purple, darkling with laurel athwart the
undulating streams of abundant incense, with majestic leisureliness, like an emperor marching
to his empire, the proudly-erect figure of Julius moved forward with easy grace ... and long
branches of the palm-tree bent in turn before him, as though expressing by their quiet rising,
their submissive obeisance, that incessantly-renewed adoration which filled to overflowing
the hearts of his fellow-citizens whom he had enchanted!

April, 1878.

THE SPARROW

I had returned from the chase and was walking along one of the alleys in the garden. My hound
was running on in front of me.

Suddenly he retarded his steps and began to crawl stealthily along as though he detected game
ahead.

I glanced down the alley and beheld a young sparrow, with a yellow ring around its beak and
down on its head. It had fallen from the nest (the wind was rocking the trees of the alley
violently), and sat motionless, impotently expanding its barely-sprouted little wings.

My hound was approaching it slowly when, suddenly wrenching itself from a neighbouring birch,
an old black-breasted sparrow fell like a stone in front of my dog's very muzzle--and, with
plumage all ruffled, contorted, with a despairing and pitiful cry, gave a couple of hops in
the direction of the yawning jaws studded with big teeth.

It had flung itself down to save, it was shielding, its offspring ... but the whole of its
tiny body was throbbing with fear, its voice was wild and hoarse, it was swooning, it was sacrificing
itself!

What a huge monster the dog must have appeared to it! And yet it could not have remained perched
on its lofty, secure bough.... A force greater than its own will had hurled it thence.

My Trésor stopped short, retreated.... Evidently he recognised that force.

I hastened to call off the discomfited hound, and withdrew with reverence.

Yes; do not laugh. I felt reverential before that tiny, heroic bird, before its loving impulse.

Love, I thought, is stronger than death.--Only by it, only by love, does life support itself
and move.

April, 1878.

THE SKULLS

A sumptuous, luxuriously illuminated ball-room; a multitude of cavaliers and ladies.

All faces are animated, all speeches are brisk.... A rattling conversation is in progress about
a well-known songstress. The people are lauding her as divine, immortal.... Oh, how finely
she had executed her last trill that evening!

And suddenly--as though at the wave of a magic wand--from all the heads, from all the faces,
a thin shell of skin flew off, and instantly there was revealed the whiteness of skulls, the
naked gums and cheek-bones dimpled like bluish lead.

With horror did I watch those gums and cheek-bones moving and stirring,--those knobby, bony
spheres turning this way and that, as they gleamed in the light of the lamps and candles, and
smaller spheres--the spheres of the eyes bereft of sense--rolling in them.

I dared not touch my own face, I dared not look at myself in a mirror. But the skulls continued
to turn this way and that, as before.... And with the same clatter as before, the brisk tongues,
flashing like red rags from behind the grinning teeth, murmured on, how wonderfully, how incomparably
the immortal ... yes, the immortal songstress had executed her last trill!

April, 1878.

THE TOILER AND THE LAZY MAN

A CONVERSATION

THE TOILER

Why dost thou bother us? What dost thou want? Thou art not one of us.... Go away!

THE LAZY MAN[71]

I am one of you, brethren!

THE TOILER

Nothing of the sort; thou art not one of us! What an invention! Just look at my hands. Dost
thou see how dirty they are? And they stink of dung, and tar,--while thy hands are white. And
of what do they smell?

THE LAZY MAN--offering his hands

Smell.

THE TOILER--smelling the hands

What's this? They seem to give off an odour of iron.

THE LAZY MAN

Iron it is. For the last six years I have worn fetters on them.

THE TOILER

And what was that for?

THE LAZY MAN

Because I was striving for your welfare, I wanted to liberate you, the coarse, uneducated people;
I rebelled against your oppressors, I mutinied.... Well, and so they put me in prison.

THE TOILER

They put you in prison? It served you right for rebelling!

    Two Years Later

THE SAME TOILER TO ANOTHER TOILER

Hearken, Piótra!... Dost remember one of those white-handed lazy men was talking to thee the
summer before last?

THE OTHER TOILER

I remember.... What of it?

FIRST TOILER

They're going to hang him to-day, I hear; that's the order which has been issued.

SECOND TOILER

Has he kept on rebelling?

FIRST TOILER

He has.

SECOND TOILER

Yes.... Well, see here, brother Mitry: can't we get hold of a bit of that rope with which they
are going to hang him? Folks say that that brings the greatest good luck to a house.

FIRST TOILER

Thou'rt right about that. We must try, brother Piótra.

April, 1878.

THE ROSE

The last days of August.... Autumn had already come.

The sun had set. A sudden, violent rain, without thunder and without lightning, had just swooped
down upon our broad plain.

The garden in front of the house burned and smoked, all flooded with the heat of sunset and
the deluge of rain.

She was sitting at a table in the drawing-room and staring with stubborn thoughtfulness into
the garden, through the half-open door.

I knew what was going on then in her soul. I knew that after a brief though anguished conflict,
she would that same instant yield to the feeling which she could no longer control.

Suddenly she rose, walked out briskly into the garden and disappeared.

One hour struck ... then another; she did not return.

Then I rose, and emerging from the house, I bent my steps to the alley down which--I had no
doubt as to that--she had gone.

Everything had grown dark round about; night had already descended. But on the damp sand of
the path, gleaming scarlet amid the encircling gloom, a rounded object was visible.

I bent down. It was a young, barely-budded rose. Two hours before I had seen that same rose
on her breast.

I carefully picked up the flower which had fallen in the mire, and returning to the drawing-room,
I laid it on the table, in front of her arm-chair.

And now, at last, she returned, and traversing the whole length of the room with her light
footsteps, she seated herself at the table.

Her face had grown pale and animated; swiftly, with merry confusion, her lowered eyes, which
seemed to have grown smaller, darted about in all directions.
