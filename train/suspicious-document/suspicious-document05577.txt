MY DEAR COUSINS,

IDA AND GABRIELLE,

THIS

STORY OF A SUMMER

IS AFFECTIONATELY

Dedicated.

This little volume is in no sense a work of the imagination, but a simple record of a pleasant
summer's residence at Chappaqua, embracing many facts and incidents heretofore unpublished,
relating to one who once occupied a large portion of the public mind.  Believing that it may
interest many who care to know more of that portion of his busy life which was not seen by
the public, but which pertained to his home circle, the author has been persuaded to print
what was written merely for the amusement of herself and friends.

THE STORY OF A SUMMER;

OR,

JOURNAL LEAVES FROM CHAPPAQUA.

CHAPPAQUA, WESTCHESTER Co.,

New York, May 28, 1873

Again at dear Chappaqua, after an absence of seven months.  I have not the heart to journalize
tonight, everything seems so sad and strange. What a year this has been--what bright anticipations,
what overwhelming sorrow!

May 30.

I have just returned from a long ramble over the dear old place; first up to the new house
so picturesquely placed upon a hill, and down through the woods to the cool pine grove and
the flower-garden.  Here I found a wilderness of purple and white lilacs, longing, I thought,
for a friendly hand to gather them before they faded; dear little bright-eyed pansies, and
scarlet and crimson flowering shrubs, a souvenir of travel in England, with sweet-scented violets
striped blue and white, transplanted from Pickie's little garden at Turtle Bay long years ago.

Returning, I again climbed the hill, and unlocked the doors of the new house; that house built
expressly for Aunt Mary's comfort, but which has never yet been occupied.  Every convenience
of the architect's art is to be found in this house, from the immense, airy bedroom, with its
seven windows, intended for Aunt Mary, to a porte cochère to protect her against the inclemency
of the weather upon returning from a drive. But this house, in the building of which she took
so keen an interest, she was not destined to inhabit, although with that buoyancy of mind and
tenacity to life that characterized her during her long years of weary illness, she contemplated
being carried into it during the early days of last October, and even ordered fires to be lighted
to carry off the dampness before she tried her new room.  By much persuasion, however, she
was induced to postpone her removal from day to day; and finally, as she grew weaker and weaker,
she decided to abandon that plan, and journey to New York while she could.  In two weeks more
she had left us forever.

June 1.

Our first Sunday at Chappaqua.  We have a little church for a next-door neighbor, in which
services of different sects are held on alternate Sundays, the pulpit being hospitably open
to all denominations excepting Papists.  Three members of our little household, however--mamma,
Marguerite, and I--belong to the grand old Church of Rome; so the carriage was ordered, and
with our brother in religion, Bernard, the coachman, for a pioneer, we started to find a church
or chapel of the Latin faith.  At Mount Kisco, a little town four miles distant, Bernard thought
we might hear Mass, "but then it's not the sort of church you ladies are used to," he added,
apologetically; "it's a small chapel, and only rough working people go there."

I was quite amused at the idea that the presence of poor people was any objection, for is it
not a source of pride to Catholics that their church is open alike to the humblest and richest;
so with a suggestive word from Bernard, Gabrielle's spirited ponies flew

  "Over the hills, and far away."

A perpetual ascent and descent it seemed--a dusty road, for we are sadly in want of rain, and
few shade-trees border the road; but once in Mount Kisco, the novelty of the little chapel
quite compensated for the disagreeable features of our journey there.  A tiny chapel indeed--a
plain frame building, with no pretence to architectural beauty.  It was intended originally,
I thought, for a Protestant meeting-house, as the cruciform shape, so conspicuous in all Catholic-built
churches was wanting here.  The whitewashed walls were hung with small, rude pictures, representing
the Via Crucis or Stations of the Cross, and the altar-piece--not, I fancy, a remarkable work
of art in its prime--had become so darkened by smoke, that I only conjectured its subject to
be St. Francis in prayer.

Although it was Whit-Sunday the altar was quite innocent of ornament, having only six candles,
and a floral display of two bouquets.  The seats and kneeling-benches were uncushioned, and
the congregation was composed, as Bernard said, entirely of the working class; but the people
were very clean and respectable in their appearance, and fervent in their devotions as only
the Irish peasantry can be.

The pastor, an intelligent young Irishman, apparently under thirty, had already said Mass at
Pleasantville, six miles distant, and upon arriving at Mount Kisco he found that about twenty
of his small congregation wished to receive Communion, as it was a festival; consequently,
he spent the next hour not literally in the confessional, for there was none, but in the tiny
closet dignified by the name of a vestry.  From thence, the door being open, we could with
ease, had we had nothing better to do, have heard all of the priest's advice to his penitents.

This ceremony over, the young Father came out in his black cassock, and taking up his vestments
which lay upon the altar-steps, he proceeded with the utmost nonchalance to put them on, not
hesitating to display a long rent in his surplice, and a decidedly ragged sleeve.

The Mass was a Low one, and the congregation were too poor to have an organ or organist.  Quite
a contrast to a Sunday at St. Stephen's or St. Francis Xavier's, but the Mass is always the
same, however humble the surroundings.

June 3.

We are unusually fortunate, I think, in our domestic surroundings. Servants are proverbially
the bête noire of American ladies, and the prospect of having to train some unskilled specimens
of foreign peasantry weighed heavily, I fancy, upon our beautiful Ida in her new responsibility
of a young Dame Châtelaine.  However, we have been, as I said, singularly successful in obtaining
servants.

To my great delight, there is not one ugly name in our little household, although composed
of eight members, commencing with Queen Esther as mamma has been named; then we four girls--la
Dame Châtelaine, with her fair face, dark, pensive eyes, and modest dignity; Gabrielle, or
Tourbillon, our brilliant pet, and the youngest of our quartette, although her graceful figure
rises above the rest of us; my sister Marguerite, la Gentille Demoiselle; and I, Cecilia.

Then come the household retinue: Bernard, the coachman, already introduced, a smart-looking
young Irishman, whom the maids always find very beguiling; Lina, the autocrat of the kitchen,
a little, wiry-looking woman from Stockholm, formerly cook, so she says, to King Charles of
Sweden; and Minna, the maid.

Minna is a pretty young Bavarian, who has been only fifteen days in the Land of Liberty, but
she has already learnt, I am amused to see, not to address a lady as "gnädige Frau," or "Fräulein"--a
style of address imperative in South Germany from a maid to her mistress.  Minna has not, however,
imbibed all of the democratic principles that will, I fear, come to her only too soon, for
she has not yet learnt to emulate her mistress in dress.  It is really quite refreshing to
see a servant dressed as a servant.  Minna is the perfection of neatness, and her plain stuff
or print gowns are sans reproche in their freshness.  In the matter of aprons she must be quite
reckless, for they always look as if just from the ironing-table.  They are made, too, in an
especially pretty fashion that I have never before seen out of Munich. Scorning chignons, Minna
appears with her own luxuriant hair in massive braids wound about her well-shaped head, and
as to-day is Sunday and a Fest-tag, she adorns herself with a large shell-comb.  She has very
pretty, coquettish ways, that have already melted the heart of our hitherto unsusceptible Bernard,
and it is quite charming to hear her attempts to converse with him in her broken English.

Minna came to me this morning directly after breakfast, and said, "Where shall I go to church,
Fräulein Cecilia?"

"I do not really know, Minna," I replied.  "You are a Lutheran, I suppose?"

"Yes, Fräulein Cecilia."

"There is no church of that sort here," I said, "but there is a Reformed Church next door."

With a very doubtful expression, she said: "I will see, Fräulein.  And bitte, is not the Pfingsten
a Fest-tag in America?  In our country, you know, it is more than Sunday, and the people always
amuse themselves."

I explained to her as clearly as I could, that Pfingsten (Whit-Sunday) was only a Fest-tag
in her church, mine, and the Church of England, and that it was never in this country a Fest-tag,
outside of the religious observance.

A very perplexed face was the result of my explanations; why Pfingsten should not be Pfingsten
the world over, and a public holiday with all sorts of merry-makings, she could not understand.

June 4.

Yesterday the piano was sent up from Steinway's, where it has been stored since last fall,
and now we have all settled to our different occupations, and are as methodical in the disposition
of our time as though we were in school.

None of us are very early risers, for mamma, who should naturally set us a good example, has
been too long an invalid to admit of it, and we girls have become habituated to the luxury
of breakfasting in bed, from residence abroad and in the tropics.  Not that we breakfast in
bed at the "Villa Greeley," however; we are much too sociable, and our dining-room is too attractive,
for that.   But we gratify our taste for reasonable hours by assembling around the table at
half-past eight.

"Shocking!" I fancy I hear Katie exclaim.  "I breakfast at least two hours earlier.  How can
you bear to lose so much of the beautiful morning?"

Don't imagine, dear Katie, that I sleep till half-past eight: you must know the wakeful temperament
of our family too well for that.  I find it, however, very poetic and delightful to listen
to the matins of the robins, thrushes, and wrens, from my pillows; and by merely lifting my
head I have as extended a panorama of swelling hills and emerald meadows, as though promenading
the piazza.

I have been in my day as early a riser as any one--even you, dear Katie, have not surpassed
me in this, respect; for you recollect those cold winter days when I arose at "five o'clock
in the morning," not, however, to meet Corydon, but to attack the Gradus ad Parnassum of Clementi
by gaslight, in my desire to accomplish eight hours of practice undisturbed by visitors.  At
seven, however, I used to meet with an interruption from my German professor.  Poor man!  I
now pity his old rheumatic limbs stumbling over the ice and snow to be with me at that unreasonable
hour of the morning.  But I then was ruthless, and would not allow him even five minutes grace,
for my time was then regulated like clockwork, and a delay of a few moments would cause an
unpardonable gap in my day.  Now, however, that my education is nominally finished, I feel
that I may without self-reproach indulge in some extra moments of repose, for it is impossible
for one to work all the time; and a quiet hour of reflection is often, I think, as useful as
continual reading or writing.

We indulge in very simple morning toilettes here, as we have no gentleman guests for whom to
dress, nor ladies to criticise us; consequently a few brief moments before the mirror suffice
to make us presentable.  A black print wrapper made Gabrielle-fashion, with our hair brushed
off plain from our faces, and flowing loosely à la belle sauvage, or in cool braids, is the
order of the day.  Even Marguerite, who is the most conventional of our quartette, has conformed
to the fashion reigning here, and no longer coiffed in the stylish Impératrice mode, her sunny
brown hair floats over her shoulders unconfined by hair-pins, cushions, or rats.  Truly we
live in Arcadian simplicity, for under our roof there are neither curling nor crimping irons,
nor even a soupçon of the most innocent poudre de riz.

At half-past eight a little hand-bell, silver in material and tone, summons us to the breakfast-room.
This room is on the ground floor, and is one of the prettiest in the house.  Four windows give
us an extended view of our Dame Châtelaine's sloping meadows and wooded hills, and the carriage
road winding off towards the pine grove and the house in the woods.  We have several pictures
on the walls--first a portrait of my dear uncle; a boyish face with fair hair, deep blue eyes,
and an expression angelic in sweetness.  No one would imagine it to be the face of a married
man, but it was painted, mamma says, when he was thirty years old.  Two large and admirable
photographs, taken early last summer, hang opposite it.  A striking contrast they are to the
pensive, fragile, blonde boy; these are impressed with the vigor and mental and physical activity
of his busy life, but the broad intellectual brow, and the almost divine expression that plays
about the mouth, are the same in each.

An engraving from a picture by Paul Delaroche, the Archangel Gabriel--the "patron," in Catholic
parlance, of our little Gabrielle--hangs between the windows, and over the comfortable sofa
is a copy of Liotard's celebrated pastel "la belle Chocolatière" in the Dresden Gallery.  This
copy Aunt Mary bought in that city when there some years ago, and it is considered wonderfully
fine.  Very pretty and coquettish she looks in her picturesque Vienna dress, with the small,
neatly-fitting cap, ample apron, and tiny Louis Quinze shoes.  In her case

  "My face is my fortune,"

was exemplified, and so pretty and modest is her demeanor that it is no wonder that Count Dietrichstein,
haughty nobleman though he was, married her.  She is very different, however, from the chocolate
vendors whom I have seen in the streets of Paris.  I don't think a nobleman would ever raise
one of them from their original station, for they are as a rule past fifty, and ugly and withered
as only a Frenchwoman of that age can be.

Breakfast is followed by a turn upon the piazza, a little stroll to the spring, near which
delicious wild strawberries nestle in a background of sweet clover, bright buttercups, and
field daisies, or a game of croquet under the grand old oak-trees

  "After the sun has dried the dew."

Then we separate, each to our own room, and our different occupations.

Ida is very busy now, for she is preparing a volume for publication in the fall--her dear father's
manuscript lectures and letters.

Gabrielle throws herself upon a sofa, and lies there motionless, absorbed in the fascinating
pages of some favorite book; indeed, she is so quiet that in my periodical fits of tidiness
I often seize a print or bombazine frock, thrown, as I suppose, carelessly upon the bed or
sofa, and only by its weight do I discover that it is animated.  Last year, Gabrielle's favorite
site for reading was in the dear old apple-tree close beside the house; but since she has attained
the dignity of sixteen and train dresses, she has abjured the apple-tree.

Marguerite is translating a volume from the German, Musikalische Märchen, and I divide my time
between the piano and occasional newspaper articles.

But it is already one o'clock and dinner hour.  The afternoon passes much like the morning.
We have letters to write, and much reading aloud.  I have two books in progress--Plato's "Dialogues,"
and Madame de Stäel's incomparable "Germany:" the latter I read aloud while in Munich, but
it is a work that cannot be too often studied.

At half-past six we dress and go down to the postoffice (about a hundred yards distant) for
the evening mail.  Half an hour later we sup, and then follows, as L. E. L. would say, "a struggle
and a sacrifice."  What could be more delicious than a game of croquet, or a drive in the cool
twilight?  But Chappaqua, lovely though it is, possesses a malaria that is dangerous after
sunset, they say, and much as I love to drive when Nature is bathed in the last ruddy flush
of day, and during the soft gray hour that succeeds it, I must heed the prediction of chills
to all who indulge.

The evening is always devoted to music.  Both Ida and Gabrielle are very fond of the piano,
and Ida is rapidly becoming quite proficient in the divine art.  She commenced the study of
music when a little child, under an excellent teacher, and also took lessons while in boarding-school;
but one studies the piano under difficulties while in the routine of a pensionnat, for the
hour devoted to it must be taken from one's recreation time, or from some other lessons.  Our
friends will remember, too, that dear Ida was taken out of school while yet very young, to
become the devoted nurse that she has since shown herself to her mother, and from the time
she left the Sacré Coeur until this spring she has never opened the piano.  Now, however, she
practises regularly and conscientiously, and brings to her music all the enthusiasm of her
loving nature, and the intelligence of her superior mind; consequently, when her fingers are
well trained, I shall expect to see her a thoughtful and brilliant pianist.

Gabrielle is still in the tedious preliminary steps, for Geometry and Latin, rather than the
Rhythme des Doigts and the Ecole de la Velocité, have hitherto engaged her attention; but time
will show.

June 5.

As unexpected visit yesterday from Mr. O'Dwyer, a member of The Tribune staff, and for several
years dear uncle's private secretary.

Mamma had invited Mr. O'Dwyer to come out and pass a quiet day with us, and had appointed Wednesday
for the visit.  Desirous of a little excitement, and already somewhat weary of our nun-like
simplicity of toilette, we decided to do honor to our guest by dressing our hair quite elaborately,
and attiring ourselves, despite the heat, in our best bombazines with their weight of crape.
We were assembled in the dining-room after our early dinner, discussing, in our plain print
wrappers and Marguerite braids, our plans for the morrow, when Minna announced:

"A visit, Madame; a gentleman."

"Probably a neighbor upon business," said mamma to us; "show him in here, Minna."

The door opened, and enter the guest for whom, in imagination, we were making such extensive
preparations.

A very expressive glance was telegraphed around our circle.  I was engaged in the domestic
occupation of hemming one of papa's handkerchiefs, and although Hawthorne draws so pretty a
picture of the beautiful Miriam while engaged in "the feminine task of mending a pair of gloves,"
with all deference to the poet's taste, I consider the beguiling little scraps of canvas or
kid which I produce when company is present, much more attractive than plain sewing.

In a moment the surprise was explained.  Mr. O'Dwyer had received orders to represent The Tribune
somewhere, the following day, just in time to catch the Pleasantville express, and run out
to tell us that he could not come at the time appointed.

"The circumstances were trying," we said to each other, after his departure; but imagine, girls,
how much worse they would have been, had the visitor been a lady!  As long as a wrapper is
black, I very much doubt if a gentleman would know it from an afternoon dress.

June 8.

The usual routine of our morning occupations has been somewhat broken of late, for these June
days are too perfect to be spent within doors, even with such grand companions as Plato or
Beethoven.  We plan charming hours to be spent in the pine grove, where Marguerite will read
to us a chapter or two of Kohlrausch's "Germany," and Ida will give us a few pages of Taine's
brilliant "Angleterre;" but as we are starting with camp chairs, books, and work, Bernard approaches:

"Any orders, Miss?"

Frail mortals are too weak to resist, and in a few moments we are seated in Ida's stylish new
phaeton; and Gabrielle's irrepressible ponies, under the guidance of Tourbillon herself, are
dashing away at a pace that terrifies our sober Quaker neighbors beyond expression. Mamma has
been solemnly warned against allowing Gabrielle to drive "those fearful horses;" but we all
share our pretty Tourbillon's fondness for a tourbillon pace, and know well the strength she
possesses in her little wrists, and the coolness she could exercise were there any danger.

While returning from a charming drive upon the Sing Sing road, a day or two since, the horses,
whose spirits were unusually high, shied suddenly at something dark by the roadside.  By a
dexterous management of the reins, Gabrielle quickly subdued them, and we all looked to see
what had startled them.  An object was crouching in the grass, evidently human, but of what
sex or nationality it was impossible in one swift glance to determine; and it was quite amusing
to hear our different opinions as we drove on.

"I think," said mamma, "that it was an enormous woman, with a baby in her arms, but I really
cannot be sure, for I only looked at the face--such a hideous, repulsive face.  I shall dream
of it to-night, I am convinced."

"A woman!" said Marguerite.  "My impression was of a very murderous-looking man--an Indian,
I thought, he was so very dark."

Gabrielle's view of the case differed from the others.  The creature had, she said, a heavy
black beard, which, was un-Indian-like, and was garbed in a dark calico gown with open sleeves,
through which she plainly perceived a pair of unmistakably muscular, masculine arms.  In the
words of Macbeth--

      "You should be woman,
  And yet your beard forbids me to interpret
  That you are so."

Neither Marguerite nor Gabrielle had seen the baby, and Gabrielle's conclusion that this frightful
being was a convict who had escaped from Sing Sing disguised as a woman, was quite logical.

"Chappaqua is certainly in unpleasant proximity to Sing Sing," I said with a shudder, for I
have not many elements of a heroine about me.

"Yes," was mamma's cheerful rejoinder, "and you know we were told yesterday that one or two
of the most dangerous convicts had recently escaped, and had entered several houses in Chappaqua--to
say nothing of Mr. O'Dwyer's report that that dreadful Captain Jack has escaped, and is known
to be lurking in the neighborhood of our peaceful little village."

"Pray let us change the subject," I entreated, "or between convicts and Modocs I shall have
the nightmare for a month."

June 9.

We have just said good-by to Señor Delmonte, of Hayti, who has gone down on the 4.45 train,
after passing, I hope, a pleasant day with us.

We have led such a quiet life since last fall, that a visit from a friend is a very pleasant
excitement, and with the assistance of our invaluable Minna and Lina, there is nothing to be
dreaded in the preparations.  Then, too, it is so pleasant to unpack the superb linen that
Aunt Mary bought abroad--the heavy damask table-cloths with their beautiful designs, and the
immense dinner napkins, protecting one's dress so admirably against possible accident--and
to take out the exquisite silver and Sèvres; everything is perfection, even to the little gold,
lily-shaped hand-bell.  Afterwards we go to gather flowers in all their morning freshness,
and if it is ten o'clock, we walk down to the station to meet the New York train.

Señor Delmonte is a very agreeable gentleman, and quite a favorite in New York circles.  In
figure he rises far above ordinary humanity, six feet two inches being, I believe, his exact
height--and his very dark complexion and stately gravity render him quite conspicuous in a
drawing-room.  He is reported extremely wealthy.

Upon returning from a drive on the Pleasantville road with Señor Delmonte, Ida ran down to
the kitchen for a moment, to see if harmony reigned there (for Lina and Minna are not, I regret
to say, becoming warm friends; but more of that to-morrow).  Ida rarely troubles the cook with
her presence, for Lina, like all cordons bleus, is a great despot, and impatient of surveillance;
but as she can be trusted to arrange an entire menu without any hints from Ida, la Dame Châtelaine
gladly leaves the responsibility to her.  What therefore was my surprise to see Ida return
from her visit downstairs with an unmistakable look of anxiety upon her pretty face, and beckon
me out of the music room where we were sitting.

"What do you think, Cecilia?" she announced, in despairing accents. "Lina has made a soup of
sour cream, which is now reposing in the ice-box!"

"Of what?" I said, scarcely crediting her words, and running down to the kitchen.

Lina's feelings were considerably ruffled that her young mistress did not appreciate the soup,
which she considered a triumph of art, and which consisted of sour cream, spices, and a little
sugar--to be eaten, of course, cold.

"Nice soup," she said, in the most injured tones; "King of Sweden think excellent, but Miss
no like it."

It was, however, too late to make another soup, so we consoled ourselves with the thought that
a king approved of it, and we would show a plebeian taste if we did not also appreciate it.
However, some wry faces were made over the unlucky soup at the table, and the King of Sweden's
taste was the subject of much merriment.

I was somewhat sceptical at first that Lina had ever been in the royal household at Stockholm,
notwithstanding that she did cook so admirably; but she managed yesterday evening to tell me,
in her broken English, about her residence in the palace.

It seems that inexperienced cooks can, by paying a certain sum, be admitted into the royal
kitchen to learn from the chief cook.  After they have perfected themselves in their profession,
they receive wages, and upon leaving, are presented with a diploma.  Why could not a somewhat
similar institution--omitting the sovereign--become practicable in our own country?  Both housekeepers
and newspapers groan over the frightful cooking of our Bridgets; Professor Blot lectures upon
the kitchen scientifically and artistically considered, and our fashionable ladies go to his
classes to play at cooking; but the novelty soon wears off, and home matters continue as badly
as ever.

I do not know if the President would consent to imitate the Swedish sovereign, by throwing
open the kitchen of the White House in the same liberal fashion, but surely he ought to be
willing to make some sacrifices for the common good--perhaps even to submit occasionally to
a dinner spoilt by the experiments of young apprentices to the culinary art.  Three months'
training ought to suffice to make a very good cook, and with a diploma from the White House,
situations would be plentiful, wages higher than ever, and employers would have the satisfaction
of knowing that their money was not thrown away.

June 11.

We may pass some sad hours at Chappaqua this summer, but I do not think we shall suffer from
ennui--that is, if the startling events of the past week are to be repeated often during the
summer.

I have already spoken of the escaped convict whom we saw in the grass the other day.  It is
unnecessary to say that we carefully barricaded our doors that night; for, in case of danger,
our situation would not be a cheerful one--a household of seven helpless women, save during
papa's weekly visit, and Bernard, our only protector, asleep in the side-hill house.  Our precautions,
however, were superfluous; the convict did not favor us with a visit, but something far more
thrilling than the loss of the family silver was in store for us.

Dear Ida has received since last fall scores of letters from, I think, every State in the Union,
and even from Europe, from people of whom she had never heard before, and upon all sorts of
subjects.  Some of her correspondents are interested in her spiritual, others in her temporal,
welfare; some advise change of air as beneficial after her affliction, and alternately she
is offered a home in Colorado and Maine.  But such letters form the exception; usually the
writer has a favor to request. The most modest of the petitions are for Ida's autograph or
photograph, while others request loans of different sums from units to thousands. She is occasionally
informed that the writer has a baby named Ida Greeley, and it is intimated that a present from
the godmother would be acceptable.  Again she is asked to assist in building a church, or to
clothe and educate some poor girl--her own cast-off wardrobe of colored clothes will be accepted,
the writer graciously says, although new dresses would be preferable.

One letter dated Lebanon is chiefly upon the virtues of a lucky stone, which the writer will
as a great favor sell to Miss Greeley for twenty-five dollars.  All further misfortune will,
she says, be averted from Ida if she becomes its owner; the stone is especially recommended
as beneficial in love-affairs, and, the writer kindly adds, it is not to be taken internally.

Another letter is from the mother of a young invalid girl, begging Miss Greeley, whom she knows
by report to be very wealthy and charitably inclined, to make her daughter a present of a melodeon,
as music, she thinks, might help to pass away the tedious hours of illness.

Sometimes Ida is solicited to open a correspondence for the improvement of her unknown friend,
or to dispose of some one's literary wares, while offers of marriage from her unseen admirers
are of almost daily occurrence.  I think I would not exaggerate in saying she might reckon
by the bushel these letters, written generally in very questionable grammar, and worse chirography.
In very few instances has she ever replied to them, for they have been usually from people
possessing so little claim upon her, that the favors they so boldly requested could only be
viewed in the light of impertinence.

One letter, couched in somewhat enigmatical terms, was dated from Baltimore, and was explicit
upon one point only--that it was the manifest will of Providence that Ida should marry him--S.
M. Hudson. We read the letter together, laughed a little over it, and threw it into the waste
basket.  Time passed, and we came out here.  Ida was greeted upon her arrival by another letter
from the mysterious Hudson, who, not at all discomfited by the cool reception, of his proposal,
addressed her as his future wife, and announced that he had come on from Baltimore to marry
her, that he was now in New York, and would wait there to hear from her.

"The man is certainly crazy!" exclaimed Marguerite.

"Indeed he is!" said mamma, reading his rambling sentences very slowly: "I should judge him
to be perfectly insane, and I only hope he will not come out here to pay his fiancée a visit."

"You know he requests me to send him funds to defray his expenses, Aunt Esther," said Ida quietly;
"perhaps the lack of money will avert such a calamity."

"What an unromantic conclusion to a love-letter!" said Gabrielle scornfully.

The conversation turned to the depredations of the neighbors and neighbors' children upon the
property.  "Mr. Greeley's place" had always been looked upon in the light of public property,
and intruders walked and drove through the grounds quite as a matter of course, and helped
themselves freely to whatever they liked in the floral, fruit, or vegetable line.  The young
ladies, however, decided that they had submitted to such conduct quite long enough, and we
sent to Sing Sing for some printed handbills warning trespassers off the place.

Two or three days passed, and we had entirely forgotten Ida's erratic admirer, when Gabrielle
returned from a morning walk with the information that an intoxicated man was sitting upon
the steps of the side-hill house.  She met mamma and Ida starting for a little stroll, and
communicated this unpleasant news to them.  Mamma, however, is not timid, and she walked on
with Ida, determined to view the invader from afar, and then summon Bernard to dismiss him.

A figure was sitting, as Gabrielle said, upon the piazza of the new house, but was so motionless
that Ida exclaimed laughingly:

"It is a scarecrow placed there by some one in retaliation for our notice to trespassers to
keep off the grounds."

As they passed it, however, the scarecrow slowly lifted its head and addressed them with:

"Is this Mr. Greeley's place?"

"Yes," said mamma.

"And is this young lady Miss Ida?"

"Yes."

"You have received, I believe, a few letters from me, Miss Ida: my name is Hudson."

Fortunately our family are not of a fainting disposition, for a tête-à-tête with a lunatic
was a situation requiring some nerve and perfect self-control; so, although mamma and Ida were
much alarmed upon learning the name of their visitor, they neither screamed nor fainted, and
mamma invited him quite courteously to walk up to the house.

Mr. Hudson was a tall, powerful man, with cunning, restless, gray eyes, was well dressed, and
wore a linen duster.  He had come, he said, seven hundred miles to see Ida.  Upon reaching
the house, he followed mamma into the dining-room where Marguerite, Gabrielle, and I were sitting
at work.

"Ah, Miss Gabrielle!" he said, "I supposed you were at school."

One or two other rational remarks of the sort, and mamma's perfect sang-froid so deceived me
that I decided the supposed lunatic must be perfectly sane.  In a moment, however, he looked
somewhat uneasy, and said:

"I have a long story to tell your niece, ma'am, but I feel a little bashful about speaking
before so many young ladies."

"Would you like to see me alone, then?" said mamma promptly; "you would not object to telling
your story to a married woman."

Then signing to us to leave the room, she followed us to the door, and breathing rather than
whispering, "Run for Bernard," returned.

It appears that the man grew more excitable when alone with mamma, and the story he told her
was not a cheerful one to hear.

"It began," he said, "five years ago, by my father cutting his throat with a razor.  They say
he was crazy, and," with a fiendish chuckle, "some people say I am crazy too."

"Indeed!" said mamma, sympathetically, "how sad!"

"This we may call the first scene in the story," he added, although what connection there was
between suicide and his proposed marriage with Ida, poor mamma could not imagine.

I could half fill my journal with the rambling, senseless, and menacing remarks that Hudson
made to mamma, adding emphasis to his discourse by whirling a pair of very long and sharp scissors
close to her eyes (he was further armed with two razors, we subsequently learnt).  Ida, he
said, first appeared to him in a vision--a beautiful young girl in distress, who appealed to
him for aid, but some one seemed to stand between them--a tall woman dressed as a Sister of
Charity (evidently mamma, in her mourning dress and long crape veil).  He then enlarged upon
the awful punishment that inevitably overtook those who opposed the Will of Providence (i.e.,
his marriage with Ida): death by some violent means being unavoidable.  At this point, the
scissors were whirled more excitedly than ever, and Hudson's eyes glared with rage. I need
not say that mamma feared every moment would be her last; but still preserving a calm exterior,
she never took her eyes off him for an instant, and merely remarking, "It is quite warm here;
shall we not sit upon the piazza?" accompanied him there, and sat down close beside him, that
he might not suspect she feared him.  The moments seemed endless until Bernard's heavy tread
was heard upon the kitchen stairs.

"Excuse me a moment," said mamma, with a most innocent face; and in an interview of half a
minute explained to Bernard that Hudson was a dangerous lunatic who must be taken away immediately;
then waiting till the valorous Bernard was safely out on the piazza, she unceremoniously shut
and locked the door.  Hudson, apparently much surprised at such inhospitable conduct, pulled
the door-bell half a dozen times.  When he was quite wearied with his exertions, Bernard suggested
that they should take a little walk together.  Much coaxing was requisite, for Hudson was quite
determined to effect an entrance; but finally Bernard took his arm, and bore him off to the tavern.

"I had much more to say to Mrs. Cleveland," he remarked, en route, "but I fear it has already
been too much for her nerves."

At the tavern, Bernard found a constable, who immediately arrested the unhappy victim of misplaced
affection, and telegraphed to Mount Kisco for a magistrate.  Then ensued endless hours of waiting.
Mamma lay upon the sofa whiter than any ghost, now that the strain upon her nerves was relaxed,
and Mrs. L----, a loquacious neighbor, ran in from time to time with reports of what people
were saying, and how the prisoner looked and felt.

At 7 P.M. the magistrate, Mr. Clarence Hyatt, arrived, and we all went down to the improvised
court-house in the tavern.  Ida and mamma were shown into a private room, where Mr. Hyatt,
a very polite and agreeable gentleman, took their affidavits before they were confronted with
the enemy.  The news had by this time spread far and near, and all Chappaqua was assembled.
The wildest reports were now circulated, to the effect that Hudson had pointed a pistol at
Ida, and vowed to kill her instantly if she did not promise to marry him, and mamma and Ida
were advised to keep their veils down, that he might not become familiar with their faces,
and to remain at a respectful distance from him.

Hudson was sitting between two constables, and was being inspected by a large crowd.  He looked
very quiet, and upon listening to the affidavits, remarked that Mr. Hyatt must have misunderstood
the ladies, for he was perfectly incapable of having alarmed them to the extent indicated;
that he certainly admired Miss Ida, and desired to marry her, but that he would not willingly
injure or alarm the humblest creature--adding reproachfully that those affidavits would suffice
to condemn him to State prison for life.  He appeared so perfectly rational and calm, that
the magistrate was perfectly dumbfoundered, and for the moment thought him sane; and even we
commenced to reproach ourselves, and doubt which was the insane party.

"Well," said Mr. Hyatt, "I will now hear your story."

"I will read it to you," said Hudson, drawing a book from his pocket, and then commenced again
the same incoherent nonsense with which he had already favored mamma.  The object now was to
show the chain of evidence that pointed out Ida as his bride.  The most important link was
the fact that he had once seen a flock of white geese sailing through the air.  He put up his
finger, and one fluttered down to him; and as G stood both for goose and Greeley, it was a
clear manifestation of the Divine Will (at this point, the audience burst into a roar of laughter).
Besides, he liked our family, we suited him in every respect; and especially because we so
much reminded him of John the Baptist (we inwardly hoped that the resemblance would not extend
to decapitation).  If Miss Greeley would not marry him, he kindly added, he would take her
cousin Marguerite instead, but he must positively marry one of the family.  He was now perfectly
wild, and when he remarked, with a reproachful glance at Ida, that he disliked ko-kwettes,
and liked a girl who would say in answer to an offer, "Yes sir-ee," or "No sir-ee," the magistrate
brought the evidence to a conclusion.  He gave him to the constable to be taken to the county
jail, where he was to be detained until the Court sat, if, in the meantime, his relatives did
not appear from Massachusetts to claim him (for his place of residence varied--at first Baltimore,
then Michigan, it was now Massachusetts).

Hudson spent the night at the tavern, and appeared at times so rational, that he was not strictly
guarded; consequently, when the constable looked for him after breakfast, the bird had flown.
He was instantly followed, and discovered walking on the railway track about two miles off,
swinging his little bundle quite unconcernedly.  In reply to the questions of his captors,
he said that he had just intended to make a little circuit about the country, and then return
to marry Ida.

June 13.

Papa came up late last night with a supply of the latest periodicals, weekly journals, etc.,
and my pet squirrels in a new and spacious cage. These little creatures were presents to me
this spring, and are very pretty, and partially tame.  I remember, however, one escapade of
theirs shortly before we left the city.

My balcony at home is enclosed with glass, and there I frequently allowed the squirrels to
play.  A game of cache-cache, of half an hour or so, was generally necessary before I could
induce Fliegende Holländer, the livelier of the pair, to return to the narrow limits of his
cage.  One day, however, through some carelessness, the door from the balcony into my room
was left open, and the squirrels were missing. Senta (christened after the heroine of Wagner's
clever opera) was captured after some little difficulty, but not the Dutchman.  Being a flying
squirrel, he was so very tiny that he could easily conceal himself in a dark corner, and although
I descended upon my knees to peer under my sofa, bureau, writing-table, and chiffonnière, my
search was fruitless--the Flying Dutchman had evidently vanished to join the Phantom Ship.
I felt very uneasy, fearing he might fall a prey to my two cats, who would no doubt find cold
squirrel a very tempting entremet; or if he escaped this Scylla, the Charybdis of death by
starvation lay before him.  The hours passed, and Fliegende Holländer did not appear.  Senta
was cheerful, and reigned mistress of the revolving wheel--always the bone of contention between
the pair. Once, during the afternoon, I fancied I heard a scratching as if of tiny claws, but
could not obtain even a glimpse of his vanishing, fan-shaped tail.

In the evening two or three gentlemen were present, and Marguerite sang for them.  After the
song (Gounod's "Naïade," a lovely salon piece), we were speaking of the loss of dear little
Holländer, when one of our friends exclaimed:

"Why, that squirrel was perched over the register while Miss Cleveland was singing, but he
was so quiet that I thought he was stuffed."

"He evidently is fond of music," said another; "pray sing something more, Miss Cleveland, and
perhaps he may again come out."

He had travelled down from the third story to the parlor through the flue (fortunately there
was no fire), and was now commencing to desire society and food again.

"Since he is fond of music," said Marguerite, "I will sing the ballad of the Flying Dutchman
from Wagner's opera--that ought certainly to draw him out again."

A music-loving squirrel evidently, and one versed in the art; for with the first strains of
those curious harmonies and chromatic runs, descriptive of the howling winds that herald the
coming of the Phantom Ship, Holländer's tiny head peered out, followed, after a furtive glance
about, by his little body.  Two gentlemen started to capture him, and then a chase ensued.
Holländer tried to scamper up a picture, but tripped upon its glass, and fell.  At last, the
Colonel captured him in an attempt to scale the curtains, and after much struggling, kicking,
biting, and other vigorous protestations from Holländer, landed him safely in his cage.

The squirrels evidently enjoy country life very much.  Early this morning Minna took them out
of doors, and removed the bottom of the cage that they might play upon the grass, which so
much exhilarated them that I am convinced they fancied they were entirely free.  Then I removed
the hot cotton from their little nest, and filled it with fresh clover-leaves, which I am sure
they much prefer.  They run no risk of being devoured here, for Aunt Mary always disliked cats,
so that there is not one upon the place, and Gabrielle's pet dog, a native of Bordeaux, has
viewed them from afar, and snuffed at the cage, but is evidently too well-bred a Frenchman
to desire even to tease them.

June 14.

A letter to-day from one of my Paris friends, Jennie Ford.  She says:

"How divine it must be at Chappaqua!  I am glad you are enjoying yourself, and are well.  But
you do not say a word of your Western trip.  I hope you have not given it up."

Then follows a cordial invitation for me to visit her in her beautiful home upon Lake Erie,
now looking its prettiest in the leafy month of June.  All sorts of pleasant inducements are
held out: a croquet-lawn of velvet softness, long drives, and charming rides in which to display
my stylish new beaver and habit, moonlight excursions upon Lake Erie, and no lack of handsome
cavaliers, including naval officers.  However, despite all these attractions, I do not think
I shall care to leave Chappaqua this summer.

Jennie enclosed a photograph of the lady who reigned as belle of the American colony in Paris,
some four or five years ago--Mrs. Horace Jenness, then Miss Carrie Deming.  Three years of
married life have changed the beautiful Carrie somewhat, if this picture is a truthful one.
The perfect outline of her face is unaltered, but the haughty expression that "La Princesse"
wore in former days has vanished, and the fond young mother, grouped with her two little children
is prettier than ever.

June 15.

I feel singularly indolent, and indisposed to journalize this evening. Perhaps it is the result
of two hours spent in croquet, a game in which I am very unproficient and therefore find decidedly
wearisome; but Gabrielle, who is the best croquet player in Chappaqua, is in the city to-day,
and my feeble assistance was necessary to make up the quartette.

Two entire hours spent in this game seem quite an unwarrantable loss of time, but we have had
a guest from New York to-day, and therefore both Plato and Kohlrausch have remained under lock
and key in the library.

I think no one enjoys the country more thoroughly than a physician when he can escape from
his patients for a holiday, and Dr. Howe, our visitor of to-day, was not an exception.  This
gentleman is, I fancy, quite young in his profession, for his figure is of almost boyish slenderness;
his face, too, which reminds one somewhat of Shelley in its delicacy and brightness, and its
dark eyes and luxuriant curls, is quite youthful for a fully fledged M.D.

Dr. Howe returned from Europe some months since, and brought us a letter of introduction from
a friend of mamma's in Florence; but owing to mamma's long illness and the seclusion in which
we lived last winter, we have not seen him many times.

I have in my lap a number of letters received in this evening's mail. One is from my dear friend,
Mrs. Knox, the charming contralto of Christ Church.  We had expected her to visit us this week,
but her unexpected departure for the West has prevented her from doing so.  She says:

"You must truly be enjoying Chappaqua these heavenly June days.  I hope that the fresh air
and rest are putting roses into your pale cheeks and giving you health and strength for your
literary labors.  My sudden departure compels me to forego the pleasure I had anticipated in
seeing you at Chappaqua--at least until the fall.  I am appreciative of the courtesy of your
dear mamma in inviting me to spend a day in that lovely retreat, already made sacred to me
by my high regard and admiration for your most noble uncle, whose home it was."

Another letter is written upon most dainty stationery, bearing the impress of Tiffany, and
adorned with a prettily devised monogram in lavender and gold (handsome stationery is one of
my weaknesses).  This letter I know to be sprightly and amusing before I open it, for my friend
Lela has been for two or three years one of my most entertaining correspondents.  We were intimate
friends in Paris three or four years ago, when Lela was a school-girl, and I an enfant de Marie,
and although we have been separated by hundreds of miles, by the ocean, and finally, by Lela's
marriage, our attachment continues; so, no reproaches upon school-girl friendships, I beg.

Lela was married last winter, but she and her handsome French husband are yet in the honeymoon,
which will last, I fancy, forever--certainly the former Queen of Hearts seems now to care for
only one heart.  She says:

"You must be having a lovely time in such a charming place.  We have been to Saratoga.  It
was stupid enough to send your worst enemy there."

June 17.

This week has been quite lost, so far as study is concerned, for nearly every day has been
interrupted by visitors.

Looking out of the window this morning, I saw a carriage containing two strange young ladies
stop before the house.  In answer to their inquiry for Miss Greeley and Miss Gabrielle, Minna
informed them, in her broken English, that they were both in the city for the day.  They looked
quite aghast upon receiving this information, for they had already dismissed their carriage,
in which they had driven from Pleasantville, and knew probably that there was no down train
till 4.45, so quite helplessly they inquired if no members of the family were at home. Learning
that Mrs. Cleveland and her daughters were here, one of the young ladies, a stylish girl in
mourning, desired Minna to announce Miss Hempstead and her cousin.  I puzzled a little over
the name while glancing in the mirror to see that my crape ruffle was properly adjusted, and
my hair in tolerable order.  The name seemed familiar, and yet I knew that no friend of mine
bore it.

I found the young ladies in the music room.  Miss Hempstead introduced herself by saying:

"Perhaps you may have heard my name, although you do not know me.  My brother was a friend
of Mrs. and Miss Greeley, and was purser of the Missouri."

I was then somewhat surprised that I had not divined Miss Hempstead's identity from the name
and her black dress; but the burning of the Missouri made scarce any impression upon me at
the time, surrounded as I was last fall by such heavy family afflictions; and the name of the
young purser, whose tragic fate then filled the newspapers, had since then almost entirely
passed from my memory.

An ordinary passenger ship is wrecked or burned, "Extras" are issued, a three days' excitement
follows, and it is then a thing of the past; but as the Missouri bore, on this memorable voyage,
not indeed Caesar and his fortunes, but the supposed fiancé of dear Ida, its loss is an event
still interesting to the gossiping public.  It was useless to try to convince any one that
no engagement had ever existed between Mr. Hempstead and Ida: no one would credit my most solemn
protestations. Many people not personally acquainted with us, but who knew the facts "upon
the best authority," as outsiders usually do, said that the marriage was to have taken place
before the election, but after Aunt Mary's death it was postponed for three months.  Before
two weeks had elapsed, however, Mr. Hempstead was, in the poetic language of the journals,
"sleeping beneath the coral wave," and poor Ida received as many well-meant condolences over
his death as over Aunt Mary's.

When the tragedy of last autumn was all over, the interest of the public was greater than ever,
and Ida, "who had within four short weeks lost mother, lover, and father," formed the subject
of many a pathetic editorial and sermon.  A London journal styled Ida the "maiden widow," spoke
of uncle's fond attachment to Mr. Hempstead, and announced that the loss of his prospective
son-in-law was an affliction that precipitated Mr. Greeley's death.

I first heard of Mr. Hempstead in the winter of 1869-70.  Aunt Mary, who was then commencing
to fail, went with Ida to Nassau to spend the cold months.  Her state-room, engaged at the
last moment, was a very uncomfortable one, and Mr. Hempstead, then purser of the Eagle, gave
up for her use a large deck state-room with three windows--a great comfort to Aunt Mary, who
was always so partial to an airy bedroom. The voyage proved, however, a very stormy one, and
the waves dashed in through these three windows, quite drenching poor Ida, who suffered so
much from sea-sickness as to be quite indifferent to danger or discomfort.

In writing to me after reaching Nassau, Ida mentioned Mr. Hempstead in a few words:

"The purser was an agreeable and gentlemanly officer, and so kind to mamma."

She did not, however, mention his name, and I never knew it till last summer.

After their return to New York, in the spring of 1870, Aunt Mary invited Mr. Hempstead to visit
them at Chappaqua, as she felt under some obligations to him for having given her his state-room,
and subsequently executed some little commissions for her, between New York and Nassau.  He
came out here, and made a visit of a week.  In July of the same year.  Aunt Mary and Ida went
abroad, and from that time the acquaintance dropped.  That he admired Ida know, but how any
one could manufacture an engagement from such slight material, I cannot imagine.

One day last summer, during the excitement of the campaign, I had taken up a rose-tinted society
journal as a little respite from politics, when my eyes fell upon a paragraph announcing Ida's
engagement to Mr. William Hempstead, Purser of the Missouri; and then I for the first time
learnt the officer's name.  My astonishment can be imagined; and to this day it remains an
enigma who invented that little society item. If a fertile-minded reporter had desired to head
his column of Engagements in High Life with Ida's name, and had announced that she would shortly
be led to the hymeneal altar (I believe that is the correct phrase in newspaper parlance) by
any one in our circle of acquaintances with whom she was at all intimate, it would not have
been surprising; but why a person whom she had not seen or heard of for two years should have
been selected, is a mystery worthy of G. P. R. James.

But in writing about Mr. Hempstead, I have neglected his sister.  Miss Hempstead was a tall,
fine-looking young girl, with, however, a strikingly foreign appearance for an American pur
sang.  She was born, she told me, in Belize, Central America, where her father was United States
Consul.  A tropical sun had given her a complexion of Spanish darkness, heightened by large
black eyes and jet black hair--the exact counterpart, Ida afterwards told me, of her brother,
who was often mistaken for a Cuban.

When the period of the consulate of Mr. Hempstead père was over, he had become so much attached
to Belize, that he decided to make it his future residence.  His daughter said she could not
imagine what he found to like in the place, for between earthquakes and yellow fever, one was
in a continual state of terror; there was no society, the population being almost entirely
negro, and no schools; consequently the children of the few white resident families were obliged
to go to England or to the United States to be educated.

Miss Hempstead was sent to London, and five or six years of the discipline of a first-class
English school have made her quite different from the fully fledged society queens who graduate
from our Murray Hill pensionnats at sixteen or so.  A little English reserve to tone down somewhat
their sparkling natures is all that our bewitching American girls need to make them perfect,
but I fear they will for several years yet bear the stigma of, "Charming, but too wild."

June 16.

Sunday is, I think, a very triste day in the country (low be it spoken).  I cannot remain longer
than an hour at church, for the Mass is a low one, and the sermon consists of fifteen minutes
of plain, practical instruction, unembellished by rhetoric, to the congregation. The church,
it is true, is four miles distant, but Gabrielle's aristocratic ponies, Lady Alice and The
Duchess, fairly fly over the ground--up or down hill, it is immaterial to them--and consequently,
I find myself, when my religious duties are over, with many idle hours upon my hands.

The croquet balls and mallets, our "Magic Rings," and other out-of-door games, are put away
in the "children's play-house," a little white hut on the borders of the croquet ground, where
Ida and dear little Raffie used to keep their toys, and where Gabrielle in later days housed
her menagerie of pets.

The piano, too, is not only closed, but locked, for the flesh is weak, and I fear the temptation
of the beautiful cold keys.  It may be the baneful effect of a foreign education, but I cannot
see that there would be any evil result from a little music on Sundays.  However, we have a
Dissenting church for a next-door neighbor, and the residents of Chappaqua are chiefly Quakers,
who frown upon the piano as an ungodly instrument; so with a sigh, I replace in my portfolio
that grand hymn that in 1672 saved the life of the singer, Stradella, from the assassin's knife,
and a beautiful Ave Maria, solemn and chaste in its style as though written by St. Gregory
himself, but composed and dedicated to me by mamma's friend, Professor F. L. Ritter.

My pretty bits of fancy work with their bright-colored silks, the tiny needle-book worked while
in Munich in an especially pretty stitch, and in the Bavarian colors--blue and white--and my
Bavarian thimble--silver and amethyst--are put away in a bureau drawer, for although a Catholic,
I do not imitate our Lutheran maid, who spends her Sundays in sewing and knitting.

Plato and Kohlrausch, our week-day sustenance, do not come certainly under the head of Sunday
reading, although I see nothing objectionable in them; but after all, one requires, I think,
a change of literature on Sundays as well as a different dress, and an extra course at dinner.

"What shall we do?" says Gabrielle.

We have each written a letter or two, for Sunday is, I am sure, every one's letter-writing
day, and now we put on our broad-brimmed garden hats, with their graceful trimmings of gauze
and crape, and stroll off to the spicy pine grove, where we sit down on the dry spines, and
Arthur repeats to us quaint bits from some of the rare old books he read in the British Museum
three years ago, or entertains us with some of his own adventures when travelling on foot over
beautiful France and Italy, and "Merrie England."

Ida and I, however, wandered away from the others this morning, and strolled up to the dear
old house in the woods where she passed her childhood.  This is, to my mind, the sweetest and
most picturesque spot upon the entire estate, and I do not wonder that Aunt Mary, with her
keen love for the beautiful in Nature, her indifference to general society, and her devotion
to her children, to study, and to reflection, preferred the quiet seclusion of her home shut
in by evergreens, with the deep ravine, and the joyous little brook at her feet, to the most
superb mansion that graces our magnificent Hudson.

One of the purest springs on the place is in the ravine, or "Ida's Glen," as uncle christened
it long ago.  Here at the foot of the long wooden staircase is a basin of natural rock, and
flowing into it is the sweetest, coolest water in the world.  This water Aunt Mary always preferred
to any other on the place--even to the spring at the foot of the side-hill, so celebrated in
the campaign times as the spot where uncle and his visitors would stop to "take a drink," when
returning from a walk.  Exquisite in her neatness, Aunt Mary would frequently order the basin
of her favorite spring to be well purified by a thorough scrubbing with brush and soap, followed
by a prolonged rinsing with water.  During her illness last fall, she frequently asked to have
a pitcher of water brought from this spring, which she always especially relished.

That uncle shared his wife's partiality for this spring is evident by his description of it
in his "Recollections":

"In the little dell or glen through which my brook emerges from the wood wherein it has brawled
down the hill, to dance across a gentle slope to the swamp below, is the spring,--pure as crystal,
never-failing, cold as you could wish it for drink in the hottest day, and so thoroughly shaded
and sheltered that, I am confident, it was never warm, and never frozen over.  Many springs
upon my farm are excellent, but this is peerless."

The house in the woods was built by uncle to suit Aunt Mary's taste, and very comfortable and
complete it is.  Uncle says of it:

"It is not much--hastily erected, small, slight, and wooden, it has at length been almost deserted
for one recently purchased and refitted on the edge of the village; but the cottage in the
woods is still my home, where my books remain, and where I mean to garner my treasures."

The house consists of two stories with that most necessary addition to a country house, a broad
piazza.  To the right stands a white cottage, built for the servants.  Almost in front of the
house is a large boulder, moss-grown and venerable.  This, Aunt Mary would not have removed,
for she loved Nature in its wildest primeval beauty, and now the rock is associated with loving
memories of Raffie's little hands that once prepared fairy banquets upon it, with acorn-cups
for dishes; but now those baby hands have long since been folded quietly in the grave.

The little play-house, that has since been removed to the croquet-ground, once stood not far
from this rock, and has been used, as I said, by Gabrielle as a menagerie for her pets.  A
strange assortment they often were for a little girl.  Inheriting her mother's exquisite tenderness
of feeling towards helpless animals, Gabrielle would splinter and bandage up the little legs
of any baby robin or sparrow that had met with an accident from trying its wings too early,
would nurse it till well, and then let it fly away.  At one time she had in the play-house
a little regiment of twelve toads, a red squirrel, and a large turtle.  Aunt Mary never wished
her to cage her pets, as she thought it cruel; consequently they had the range of the play-house,
and Gabrielle fed them very conscientiously.  She ought, however, to have followed the example
of St. Francis, who used to preach to animals and insects when he had no human audience, and
given her pets a daily dissertation upon brotherly love and tolerance, for they did not, I
regret to say, live together in the Christian harmony that distinguished Barnum's Happy Family.
The result was, that one day when Gabrielle went to minister to their physical wants, she found
only a melancholy débris of little legs.  Her supposition was that the turtle had consumed
the toads and then died of dyspepsia, and that the squirrel had by some unknown means escaped
from the play-house, and returned to primeval liberty.

Forgetting this sad experience, Gabrielle endeavored at another time to bring up a snake and
a toad in the way they should go (this time in an empty hen-coop); but the snake certainly
did depart from it, and astonished the family much by gliding into the kitchen with the unhappy
toad in his mouth.  Poor Gabrielle's feelings can be imagined.  She endeavored courageously
to wrest the toad from its enemy's jaws, but all in vain; she was obliged to see the hapless
creature consumed by the snake.

Mamma has often described Aunt Mary to me as she looked when she first met her.  The portrait
mamma draws of her as a bride would scarcely be recognized by those who only knew her after
long years of weary illness had

  "Paled her glowing cheek."

I will give it in mamma's own words:

"Immediately after your uncle's marriage, he sent for me to come from my parents' quiet farm
in Pennsylvania, to spend the winter in the city with himself and his wife.  A great event
this was to me--far greater than your first visit to Europe, for the journey occupied double
the time that is now spent between New York and Liverpool, and I was a young girl whose acquaintance
with the world was confined to the narrow limits of the little village of Clymer; I had never
even been sent away to boarding-school.

"One bright September morning I started upon my eventful journey.  Your uncle Barnes drove
me in a buggy to Buffalo, a distance of three days at that time.  At this city--the first large
one that I had ever seen, my brother left me in charge of a party going through, as he supposed,
to New York.  Then ensued two weeks upon a canal boat; very slow travelling you children would
consider it, accustomed as you are to whirling over the country in an express train; but at
my romantic age, this dreamy, delicious style of boat travel was the perfection of happiness.

"At Rochester my friends left me, first placing me under the care of the captain of the canal-boat,
who promised to put me upon the steamboat when we should reach Albany.

"The prospect of the day to be spent upon the Hudson possessed no charms for me, but on the
contrary, untold terror.  I had never before seen a steamboat, but they had been introduced
upon Lake Erie, near enough to my home for me to hear, with alarm, of all the accidents that
had so far befallen them upon that very turbulent sheet of water; consequently, I embarked
upon the 'Washington,' in the full conviction that I was about to meet with my doom.

"All that day I sat motionless in a corner of the promenade deck, reading my Bible.  Perfectly
oblivious alike to the magnificent scenery that I was passing, and to the elegant toilettes
such as my country-bred eyes had never before beheld, by which I was surrounded; I neither
spoke to nor looked at any one, nor dared to leave my seat even to go to dinner; but endeavored
to gain, from the sacred volume in my hands, strength for the terrible fate that I was confident
awaited me. I have often since wondered what my fellow-travellers thought of the still, shy
little figure whose eyes were never once lifted from her Bible.

"About four o'clock a terrible explosion was heard, the boat was thrown violently upon her
side, and a scene of confusion, shrieks, and fainting-fits then ensued.  I did not faint--I
was much too alarmed for that; I merely turned very white, and trembled from head to foot.
The wheel-house had been blown away, I learnt before long, but no one fortunately was injured,
and after a delay of an hour or so the boat was righted, and we proceeded upon our journey,
at a snail's pace, however.

"Owing to the accident, we did not reach New York until ten o'clock. No one was at the pier
to meet me, for brother had supposed that I would arrive before sunset.  As I did not appear,
however, he concluded that I had not left Albany at the time appointed.  But my adventures
of the day were not yet over.  I secured a cab, and drove to the address he had given me, 123
Hudson Street, which in 1836 was by no means the plebeian locality it is at present, but a
fashionable street, devoted exclusively to elegant residences.  Upon inquiring for Mr. Greeley,
my consternation was great to learn that although he had looked at rooms in that house, he
had not engaged them, and the landlady had no idea of his address.  I was almost as timid about
cabs as I had been about the steamboat; for I had heard stories of young girls being robbed
and murdered by New York cab-drivers, and here I was, late at night, in all the whirl and excitement
of the metropolis, driving I knew not where, and entirely at the mercy of an assassin.  However,
my modest trunk did not look very inviting, I suppose, for I reached The New Yorker office--the
only other address I knew in the city--without further adventure, where I ascertained that
brother was now living at 124 Greenwich Street--a most beautiful situation close by the Battery--then
the fashionable promenade of New York.  He had written to tell me of his change of residence,
but the letter failed to reach me.

"It was half-past eleven when I finally reached my home.  The large parlor was ablaze with
lights, and crowded with people; for it was Friday, the night that The New Yorker went to press,
and brother's reception evening.  I was trembling with fatigue and excitement, and very faint,
for I had not eaten since early in the morning; but all these emotions vanished when I was
introduced to my new sister.  I had seen no pictures of her, and knew her only through brother's
description, and a few letters she had written me since her marriage, and I was quite unprepared
for the exquisite, fairy-like creature I now beheld.  A slight, girlish figure, rather petite
in stature, dressed in clouds of white muslin, cut low, and her neck and shoulders covered
by massive dark curls, from which gleamed out an Oriental-looking coiffure, composed of strands
of large gold and pearl beads.  Her eyes were large, dark, and pensive, and her rich brunette
complexion was heightened by a flush, not brilliant like Gabrielle's, but delicate as a rose-leaf.
She appeared to me like a being from another world."

To continue mamma's reminiscences of uncle's first year of married life:

"I found my sister-in-law's tastes," she said, "quite different from those of the majority
of young ladies.  In literature her preference was for the solid and philosophic, rather than
the romantic class of reading; indeed, I may say that she never read, she studied; going over
a paragraph several times, until she had fully comprehended its subtleties of thought, and
stored them away in her retentive memory for future use.  During that year, I never knew her
to read a work of fiction; but philosophy or science formed her daily nourishment; whilst brother,
whenever he had a free evening, read aloud to Mary and I from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire, sweetened now and then with a selection from Lord Byron or Mrs. Hemans--the
two poets that at that time he preferred.

"But although your Aunt Mary had such severe literary tastes, she was by no means gloomy in
her disposition, as you might perhaps infer. Your uncle being at that time editor of a weekly
journal, he was comparatively a man of leisure, and he and Mary went frequently to the theatre,
and to hear lectures--a source of great enjoyment to both of them.  They also mingled considerably
in general society, for Mary was then very fond of dancing, although there was rarely or never
any at her Friday evenings, for literary people then, as now, eschewed the goddess Terpsichore.

"I told you that I arrived in New York upon brother's reception-night. Those Friday evenings
wore a great source of pleasure to me, introducing me as they did to the literary coterie of
the metropolis. Nearly all the men and women of note at that time met in our parlors on Greenwich
Street, and many of them were regular or occasional contributors to brother's journal.  Among
the names that I can recall, were Gen. Morris, then editing the New York Mirror; the two Clark
brothers, editors of the Knickerbocker, one of whom, Willis Gaylord Clark, was at that time
writing his clever 'Ollapodiana;' Fitz-Greene Halleck, the poet; George M. Snow, who later
in life became financial editor of The Tribune, and is now deceased; Professor A. C. Kendrick,
of Hamilton College, the translator of Schiller's 'Victor's Triumph,' which subsequently appeared
in The New Yorker, and which, you will remember, your uncle has occasionally read for us at
our own Tuesday evening receptions; Mrs. O. M. Sawyer, the accomplished wife of brother's pastor,
then making her débût in the literary world with poems and occasional translations from the
German; Elizabeth Jessup Eames, who was writing stories and poems for The New Yorker, under
the signature of 'Stella;' Mrs. E. F. Ellet, in 1836 a handsome young bride, who had come up
from the South, and was contributing translations from the French and German to the same journal;
Anne Cora Lynch, now Madame Botta; and many others.

"I must not forget to mention Fisher, the sub-editor of The New Yorker, and, in his own estimation,
the most important person upon that journal.  He was what might be called a literary fop, and
was much given to the production of highly-wrought, Byronic poems and sketches. I remember
hearing that some one called one day at the office, and asked to see the editor.  Fisher immediately
presented himself.

"'What!' said the visitor, somewhat surprised, 'are you Mr. Greeley?'

"'No,' said Fisher, running his fingers nonchalantly through his curls, 'I am not Mr. Greeley,
but,' drawing himself up, 'I am the editor of The New Yorker.  Mr. Greeley is only the printer.'

"This incident having got out among brother's friends, it was considered so good a joke that
for years he was called in the office and by the literary fraternity, 'The Printer.'

"The entertainment at these Friday evenings was mainly conversation, varied by the occasional
reading of a poem.  Your Aunt Mary was much admired that winter, both for her exquisite beauty
and the charm of her winning, artless manners.  As I said, she was very fond of dancing; but
brother never had time to accomplish himself in the art.  I remember, however, that at a Christmas
party given by his partner, Mr. Wilson, he was induced to dance a quadrille.  His mathematical
accuracy enabled him to go through the figures perfectly, when he had once seen them danced;
and he enjoyed it so thoroughly, and wore such an air of unconscious happiness, that an old
Quaker lady (the mother-in-law of Mr. Wilson) who was looking on remarked to me, 'I didn't
think thee could find so beautiful a sight as thy brother's dancing this side of heaven.'

"I have described your Aunt Mary as beautiful, and perhaps you would infer that she was also
over-fond of dress.  She was no devotee to fashion, and her toilet was, even at that period,
characterized by great simplicity, but was noted, at the same time, for picturesqueness."

Ida showed me, the other day, a very interesting letter written to her father by a friend,
Mr. Yancey, who was present at his marriage, and as it confirms what mamma has said of Aunt
Mary's beauty, I will make some extracts from it.  Mr. Yancey was the son-in-law of Squire
Bragg, at whose house Aunt Mary resided while teaching school in North Carolina.

"GERMANTOWN, TENNESSEE, July 6, 1847.

"MR. GREELEY:

"DEAR SIR:--Sitting to-night 'all solitary and alone,' my mind has wandered back upon scenes
that have past eleven years ago, though vivid now even as yesterday.  It was about that time
that I saw you first, and indeed saw you last.

"Little did I then dream that I beheld in that modest personage one who is now acknowledged
as the 'distinguished and accomplished Horace Greeley.'

"You well remember your first visit to the South, I dare say.  You cannot have forgotten many
incidents that occurred at a little village of North Carolina, called Warrenton?  No, there
is one circumstance I feel assured you never can forget while memory lasts, and there are others
to which I claim the right to call your attention: for instance, do you remember your first
meeting with a certain Miss Cheney at the house of Squire Bragg, the father of Capt. Bragg,
who lately distinguished himself at Monterey and Buena Vista?  Do you now remember to whom
you related the secret of your visit, who procured the parson, and what persons accompanied
you to church, and then with your beautiful bride returned to breakfast?  We saw you take the
solemn vows, we witnessed the plighted betrothal, and when you bore away from us this prize,
you also carried our best wishes that you might be ever blessed, and she be made always happy.
May it not have been otherwise."

. . . . "I would, my dear sir, be pleased to hear from you, and to learn something of the results
and changes which time has brought about in your own family.

"Be pleased to remember me to your sweet wife, and if there be any, or many little G------s,
my kind regards to them also.

"Very respectfully,

"A. L. YANCEY."

June 18.

While out on the croquet ground this afternoon, a lady and gentleman alighted from a carriage,
and walked up to join us.  They proved to be our friends, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Wilbour,
of New York, who had driven over from White Plains to make us an afternoon call.  Mrs. Wilbour
is a charming, intellectual woman, the president of Sorosis, and a friend of many years of
both mamma and Aunt Mary.  In appearance she is tall, handsome, and queenly, dressing in perfect
taste, and a graceful hostess.  Her pretty daughter Linny is a school friend of Gabrielle's
at St. Mary's.

Mr. and Mrs. Wilbour spend much time during the summer, driving about from one town to another;
certainly the most comfortable and agreeable mode of travelling that one could adopt.

We have some agreeable neighbors here, who contribute somewhat to the general entertainment.
The aristocracy of Chappaqua are chiefly Quaker families who have lived here since the days
of the Indians, and who look down quite doubtfully upon the New York families who come out
here for the summer only, and of whose ancestry they know nothing.  The fathers and mothers
wear the Quaker dress, and use the "Friends" phraseology, which I think very pretty and caressing,
but the young people depart somewhat from the way of grace, in speech, costume, and habits.
The young girls wear whatever color of the rainbow best suits their fresh complexions, are
skilled in flirting, and with the assistance of the young gentlemen, have organized a club
for weekly croquet parties and private theatricals at the residences of the different members,
whilst picnics and riding-parties to Croton and Rye Lakes, and other pretty points of interest,
are of frequent occurrence. But of the riding-parties Gabrielle has just written a sprightly
description to a school friend, and before the letter goes to the post, I will transcribe it.

CHAPPAQUA, June 18.

"DEAR MOLLIE: I received your charming letter and photograph last week. Many thanks for both.
You ask me how do I pass my time, and what is the latest excitement?

"Well, to begin with, you must know that we have just started a club in Chappaqua for mutual
amusement, but as I have been indisposed for some time, I certainly have not yet derived much
benefit from it, but spend most of my time reading.

"Last Saturday I was just longing for something to happen, and apostrophizing the world as
a hollow sham, when Minna came up to say that we had all been invited to an equestrian party,
to start after tea.  You would have imagined I had been offered several kingdoms by my delight.
I gave two or three screams of condensed joy, while dancing wildly around the room, much to
Aunt Esther's surprise.

"But on second thoughts, what was I to do for a horse?  My ponies had never been broken to
the saddle, but having made up my mind to go, go I would, if I had to ride a wild buffalo;
so I ordered Lady Alice around an hour before the time to start.  When she arrived, the balcony
was filled with a large and anxious audience, and rather than fail before so many, I was determined
that either I should break the horse in, or she should break me.  I sprang into the saddle,
but before I could seat myself or put my foot in the stirrup, she jerked her head away from
Bernard, and commenced a series of exciting manoeuvres, rearing, plunging, and kicking.  For
about five minutes I defied all the laws of gravitation.  But when the coachman tried to seize
her bridle, she shied so suddenly that I was surprised to find myself on terra firma. I jumped
up directly and assured every one that I had not hurt myself in the least, in fact had never
felt better; but between you and me, I felt very like the dog that was tossed by the cow with
the crumpled horn.  I am afraid that by this time I had let my little angry passions rise--in
other words, I was decidedly angry.

"I got on splendidly this time, and was quite ready to start with my cousins when the time
came, although my Lady Alice evinced serious objections to the gate, and preferred ambling
gently along sideways up the hill.  After a while I intimated kindly with my whip a desire
to gallop.  I fear that, like some of our friends, she is hard to take a hint, for she progressed
by the most wonderful plunges, garnished with little kicks; but I kept her head well up, and
clawed out several handfuls of her mane.  When we came to the rendezvous, my cavalier proposed
running her for two or three miles to take down her spirits a little, after which she went
beautifully, and I never enjoyed a ride so much before.

"We rode to Lake Wampus, and everything looked so lovely, for the full moon lighted it up like
a mirror, and we had singing and thrilling ghost stories.

"Dear me, how awfully long this letter is!  Be sure you answer it soon.

"Yours lovingly,

"GABRIELLE."

June 19.

The heat and dust are becoming insufferable, for we have had no rain, save in very homoeopathic
doses, during the three weeks that we have been here.  The shrubs and bushes by the roadside
look so piteous under their weight of dust, that I feel half inclined to try the effect of
a feather brush upon their drooping leaves; and Bernard, who is never prone to take cheerful
views of anything, grows daily more gloomy when we inquire after the progress of the kitchen-garden.
But, although we are sighing under the heat, it is nothing, we are told, to what the New Yorkers
are now enduring, and our friends, Mrs. Acheson and Dr. Taylor, who came out yesterday from
the city to spend the day with us, congratulated us upon the coolness of the temperature at
Chappaqua.

The morning was passed out of doors playing croquet and walking

  "Sotto i pini del boschetto,"

to use the words of the coquettish Countess and her arch waiting-maid in the "Marriage of Figaro"
(that Letter Duo contains, I think, some of the most delicious music that the joyous Mozart
ever wrote).

The sun was too hot after our early dinner, for us to find much pleasure in croquet; so we
sat in the music-room, and upon the piazza, and listened to a few songs from Marguerite, and
watched the skill of papa and the handsome blond doctor in the "Magic Rings,"--a very easy
game, to all appearance, but one which really requires much dexterity of hand.

The music-room is, I think, the coolest and pleasantest room in the house.  It is one of the
additions built by uncle after he had purchased this house--a large, square room on the ground
floor, with curtained windows opening upon the balcony, and upon the old apple-tree.  It is
singularly favorable for music, for it contains no heavy furniture, and the floor is uncarpeted.
We had intended to remove all the pictures from the walls, that they might not deaden the sound
of the music, but we could not resist an exquisite "Mary in the Desert," purchased by uncle
in Florence, in 1851; so this painting is now hung over the piano.

Our sprightly brunette friend with the merry black eyes, Mrs. Acheson, looked unusually pretty
and charming yesterday.  I love to describe stylish toilettes as well as any fashion-writer;
so here is hers in all its details: steel-colored silk trimmed with turquoise blue, demi-traine,
her hair beautifully dressed (or coiffured, to use the fashionable newspaper word) in puffs
and rolls, and finished with a little blue feather; while an elegant fan attached to half a
yard of gold chain depended from her belt.

When the 4.45 train was at hand, Ida and I walked down to the station with our friends.  Quite
luckily there was a drawing-room car attached to the train, although such luxury is generally
confined to the express, which does not stop here.  I learnt, however, from the station-master,
that this car had borne some happy pair as far as Albany the day before, had stayed there over-night
for repairs, and was now returning in a leisurely manner to New York.

June 21.

In honor of Midsummer Day, Marguerite and I have spent the morning at the piano, playing Mendelssohn's
delicious fairy music from the Midsummer Night's Dream.

We have had little time to practise or read this week, for company has been of almost daily
occurrence; Marguerite returned yesterday morning from a flying visit to the city, accompanied
by our friends, Colonel Rogers and Mr. Hows, the artist, who is a neighbor of ours in our rural
part of the city--Cottage Place.  Colonel Rogers was dressed entirely in gray, a costume that
looked delightfully cool, and was a perfect match for his eyes.

The morning was spent in playing croquet, and in showing our guests over the place, whose wild
beauty delighted Mr. Hows' artistic eyes. We walked first to the flower-garden, where we gathered
flowers to dress the table for dinner, and then visited the pine grove, the romantic dell,
and the stone barn of which uncle was always so proud, where we spent an hour amid the sweet hay.

For the evening a drive was proposed, as we have now quite recovered from our former dread
of malaria.  Ida held the ribbons on this occasion, and as I was not one of the party, I will
insert her graceful description of the pleasant evening.

"CHAPPAQUA.

"DEAR JULIA: I was so sorry to get your letter saying you could not come.  I wish you had not
let your tiresome old dressmaker deprive me of the pleasure of your company on our expedition
to Croton Lake.

"I must tell you all about the delightful time we had.  Two of the numerous friends of our
blue-eyed Marguerite, Colonel Rogers and Mr. Hows, whose exquisite pictures you and I have
so often enjoyed together, were our cavaliers on this occasion.  As our light carriage only
has room for four, I drove the ponies myself.  We started just about sundown, and the pleasant
coolness of evening came on while there was still daylight enough to light up the constantly
changing panorama of hill and dale, and forest and distant river, beyond which the blue mountain
range dimly seen, now seemed to emerge into bolder relief, and again to fade back into cloud-land.

"Mr. Hows' delight in the scenery was certainly equalled by mine in listening to its praises.
I am very fond of this part of Westchester, and when people talk of the beauties of the Adirondacks,
I listen with the silent conviction that we have everything here but the musquitoes and the
bad cooking, with both of which I cheerfully dispense.

"But to return to our drive.  The last mile the road ran through a dark forest, following the
course of a stream called Roaring Brook, which generally makes good its title to the name,
but now, owing to the recent drouth, was reduced to roaring as gently as Bottom's Lion promised
to do.  At last the lake was reached, and turning to the right, we were soon skimming along
at a great pace on the wide boulevard that skirts the water as far along as Pine's Bridge.
There we put up our ponies at a hotel with an impossible and unpronounceable Indian name, and
accepted the Colonel's kind invitation for a row.  We all regretted there was no moon, with
as much self-reproach as if it had been accidentally left behind, but were glad enough to get
into our little white boat, that looked quite silvery against the dark current.

"The gentlemen, who had been dying to hear Marguerite sing ever since coming out here, now
suggested that her voice was all that was needed to make the hour perfect; so Marguerite, who
is as sweet and unaffected about her singing as if she hadn't the most exquisite soprano ever
heard off the stage, consented without any tiresome urging, and asked what it should be.  We
were evenly divided between 'Robin Adair' and Mario's 'Good-bye, Sweetheart,' so our pretty
songstress kindly gave us both.

"I cannot recall the delicious effect of her singing as we were drifting along in the sombre
twilight, better than by quoting Buchanan Read's charming lines, which I dare say you have
seen before:

  "'I heed not if
  My rippling skiff
  Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff;
  With dreamful eyes
  My spirit lies
  Under the walls of Paradise.

  "'Under the walls
  Where swells and falls
  The bay's deep breast at intervals;
  At peace I lie,
  Blown softly by
  A cloud upon this liquid sky.

  "'No more, no more
  The worldly shore
  Upbraids me with its load uproar:
  With dreamful eyes
  My spirit lies
  Under the walls of Paradise.'

    "I. L. G."

June 24.

The week commenced with a dash of rain, but this morning it was again as hot as though no clouds
had darkened the sky.  Croquet was out of the question, and not even for the sake of trying
my new beaver and stylish habit, so becoming to a slight figure, could I confront the dust
and the sun's blazing rays upon Nancy's back (for such is the unromantic name of the horse
that oftenest has the honor of bearing me when we ride).  No one seemed inclined to drive,
so Lady Alice and the Duchess, that had been for some time impatiently stamping, and arching
their pretty necks, evidently impatient to be off, were sent back to the stables, much amazed,
I doubt not, at our capricious conduct; while we--mamma, Marguerite, and I--sauntered up to
the cool pine grove, accompanied by Arthur, bearing a camp-chair for mamma, and a couple of
wise-looking tomes, in whose society we were to spend the morning.

But I have not yet introduced Arthur.  He is neither brother, cousin, nor fiancé, but bound
to us by almost brotherly ties, having been our playmate when we were little children; and
after the death of his parents (our eminent historian Richard Hildreth, and his gifted artist
wife), he became mamma's ward, and was our constant companion in Italy and France.  Arthur
has come on from Cambridge, where he has just taken his degree as a lawyer, to make us a visit
of some weeks, and we have had much pleasure talking over with him those poetic days that we
passed together in Florence and Venice.

But our life is never made up of talking and dreaming, delightful though it may be, and we
have a certain amount of reading to do every day, which we despatch as conscientiously as we
do our prayers.  There is no rule, however, limiting the reading to any one person, and Arthur
often relieves us of that duty.  I enjoy his reading very much, especially when one of Plato's
"Dialogues" is the lesson of the day, for into them he throws so much enthusiasm and dramatic
force, that they are quite a revelation to me.  I was amused this morning, upon turning over
the leaves of my journal of last winter, to find my first impressions of the "Dialogues" thus
laconically expressed:

"I have to-day commenced to read Plato aloud.  I cannot say that I find him very refreshing
as yet; still I try to admire him as much as I conscientiously can."

I must confess that at first the abstruse subtleties of Socrates and his brother logicians
were too much for my little brain, but now that I am more familiar with them, I quite delight
in following their arguments.  These "Dialogues" remind me of a fugue in musical composition;
only melody is wanting to make the resemblance perfect, for here, as in the "Well-tempered
Harpsichord," one train of thought is taken up, viewed from every side and in every light--that
is to say, pursued through every possible key only to return and end at the original starting-point.

June 25.

"What a delightful evening for story-telling!" said Gabrielle, as she listened to the heavy
rain-drops falling upon the leaves of the old apple-tree; "will you not give us one, Aunt Esther?"

"Yes," said Ida and Marguerite, drawing their chairs closer to mamma's sofa.  "Do tell us about
yourself when you were a young girl, and about grandpapa and grandmamma!"

"Ah," said mamma, with a sigh, "you children have never known my dear parents!"

Marguerite was the only one of the young quartette who remembered having seen grandpapa, and
her recollections of him were confused with memories of people in Europe, where our childhood
was spent.

"How did he look when you were a little girl, mamma?" I inquired.  "I think he is quite imposing
in your little picture taken the year before he died, and he must have been very handsome when
he was young."

"He was not only handsome: he was an unusual man," said mamma, decidedly.  "No biographer,
in speaking of our family, has ever estimated him correctly, and even dear brother himself
does not give sufficient importance to father's fine character and mental qualities; but you
know that he left home when a boy of fifteen, and after that time he only saw father at long
intervals.

"You remember, Cecilia, that all the foreign sketches you have ever read of brother, announce
that his parents were 'common peasants,' while many American writers, although they do not
use the word 'peasant,' convey a similar impression.  Father was by no means a common man,
for to be 'common' one must be vulgar or ignorant, and father was neither.  He was not uneducated,
although his schooling was very slight; but he was a good reader, was very skilful in arithmetic,
and wrote an excellent hand--an accomplishment for which our family are not celebrated--beside
possessing a hoard of self-acquired information upon different subjects.  During the long winter
evenings in our lonely Pennsylvania home, he taught us younger children arithmetic, and was
very fond of giving us long sums to puzzle out.  I have often, heard him say to brother Barnes,

"'You must store your mind with useful knowledge, that when you go out into the world you will
have something to talk about as well as other people.'

"A poor farmer in those days did not have much opportunity to acquire accomplishments, as you
may well imagine; but father possessed one talent that, if properly directed, might have made
his fortune and ours.  I have never yet heard a natural voice that excelled your grandfather's;
a high, clear, powerful tenor, with unsurpassed strength of lungs, which, added to his handsome
presence, would have made him one of the finest singers that has yet trodden the boards.  Of
course his voice was uncultivated, with the exception of the slight training of country singing-classes,
and the songs that he knew were simple ballads; but his memory was very retentive, and his
singing was in great demand when company was present.  At husking-parties and apple-bees, when
supper was over and the young people wished to dance, if no fiddler was present, father would
be petitioned to sing.  I have often known him to sing country dances for hours, and he sung
so heartily, and marked the time so well, that the young people enjoyed the dancing as much
as if the music had been furnished by the most skilful violinist.

"I told you that father was a handsome man.  He had large blue eyes, soft, silky, brown curls
clustering around a magnificent brow, a set color in his cheeks, and a hand that the hardest
field labor could not deprive of its beauty--long, tapering fingers, and pointed nails, such
as novelists love to describe, but in real life are rarely seen outside of the most aristocratic
families.  His teeth were small, white and even, and at the time of his death, when eighty-seven
years old, he had only lost one.  His figure, though less than six feet, gave the impression
of a much taller man; for he was slenderly built without being thin, and his carriage was almost
military.  To this fine presence was added an air of dignity and almost hauteur, that was very
unusual in a poor farmer.  But father was proud to an unparalleled degree.  Indeed, it was
his pride that caused him to plunge into the wild forests of Pennsylvania.  His haughty nature
could not bear the life of subordination that he led in Vermont, where he did not own an acre
of land, and was obliged to work under the orders of others, often far inferior to him, and
where he fancied the story of his flight from New Hampshire was known to every one.  Smarting
with mortification, he toiled until he could save a few hundred dollars to buy some acres in
the wilderness, far from all his former associates, and there he buried himself with my dear
mother and their five little children.  But these morose feelings were somewhat subdued as
the years rolled on.

"With his children he was affectionate, but, like an old-school father, very distant.  He never
struck one of us in his life--a glance being sufficient to enforce obedience, or subdue the
wildest spirits.  He was always as particular about the etiquette of the table as though we
were served by footmen in livery; and in our poorest days, when cups and saucers were scant
and spoons still more so, we were obliged to observe the utmost decorum till we were helped;
and any laughing or chatter among the younger ones was immediately quelled by the emphatic
descent of father's fork upon the coverless table, with the words, 'Children, silence!'

"Father was highly respected by our neighbors in Pennsylvania, and was often urged to accept
some county office.  However, he always declined."

"Do you think, mamma," said Marguerite, "that grandmamma was as handsome as grandpapa?"

A pause of a moment or two.

"They were very different," was her reply.  "Mother had neither father's brilliant face, nor
his imposing presence, but she was a very handsome woman.  She had soft blue eyes, a perfectly
straight nose, a mouth rather large, perhaps, for beauty, but full of character, brown hair
tinged with red, and a transparent, though not pallid complexion. If you wish more minute details,
look at your uncle's picture.  No man ever resembled a woman more strikingly than he did our
dear mother."

"In a recently published life of uncle," said I, "the author speaks of grandmamma as often
working in the fields, and describes her as large and muscular, and possessing the strength
of a man.  Is not that an exaggeration?"

"Mother was above medium height," was mamma's reply, "but her figure was slender, with small
and well-shaped hands and feet.  It was her pride that water could flow under the arch of her
instep; and her fingers, notwithstanding the hard toil of daily life, remained so flexible,
that, when fifty years old, she could still bend them backwards to form a drinking-cup."

"Let me tell you, Aunt Esther," interposed Ida, "how grandmamma is remembered in Vermont. 
When Gabrielle and I were quite small children, we went there on a visit, and papa took us
to see some old lady (whose name I have forgotten) residing in Westhaven.  This lady had known
grandmamma very well, and, after contemplating Gabrielle and I for some time, remarked curtly,
'Neither of you children are as handsome as your grandmother was.'"

This uncomplimentary remark caused us all to laugh heartily.  Mamma then resumed her story.

"As for field labor, your grandmother may, while we were in New Hampshire, have sometimes assisted
father for a day or two during the pressure of haying or harvesting time; but never, since
I was old enough to observe, can I recollect seeing her work in the fields. Certainly mother
was not a woman to hesitate to do cheerfully whatever necessity required.  But she had quite
enough to occupy herself at home with the entire duties of a house, with the spinning, weaving,
and making up of all the linen and woollen cloth that the household used; and the care and
early instruction of her little ones--for it was her pride that all of her children learned
to read before going to school. I remember that when I was first sent to school, at the age
of four, the teacher, with a glance at my tiny figure (for I was a small, delicate child),
called me up to read to her, and opened the book at the alphabet.  Deeply injured, I informed
her that I knew my letters, and could read over in 'An old man found a rude boy in one of his
apple-trees,'--a fable that all familiar with Webster's Spelling-book will remember.

"My first distinct recollection of mother is in the dark days in New Hampshire.  Father, as
you know, had lost everything that he possessed, and was obliged to fly into the next State
to escape imprisonment for debt.  After he left, his furniture was attached and sold.  I remember
seeing strange, rough men in the house, who pulled open all the trunks and chests of drawers,
and tossed about the beautiful bed and table linen that mother had wrought before her marriage.
Another picture, too, is impressed indelibly upon my mind--how mother followed the sheriff
and his men about from room to room with the tears rolling down her face, while brother Horace,
then a little white-haired boy, nine years old, held her hand and tried to comfort her, telling
her not to cry--he would take care of her.

"But mother, although humiliated and heart-sore at the poverty and disgrace that lay before
her so early in her married life, was not a woman to fold her hands and think sadly of what

  "'--might have been.'

She wiped away her tears, and her busy fingers were soon preparing warm hoods and dresses to
protect her little ones from the bitter cold during the journey that lay before us, for in
the course of two or three months father had by hard toil earned money sufficient to send for
us.  I remember very well that journey over the mountains covered with snow into the State
of Vermont, and our establishment in what was called the 'small house by the ledge' in the
little neighborhood of houses clustering on and about the old Minot estate.

"You children, accustomed as you have been from your infancy to the attractive text-books of
the present day, would quite scorn the system of instruction at the school I attended in Westhaven.
I went there three winters, but although I soon rose to the first class in reading and spelling,
in which branches I was unusually precocious, my education was confined entirely to those two
departments of learning. Few text-books were then used in the school, for the parents of the
children were generally too poor to pay for many, and the musty old Grammar and Arithmetic
were kept in reserve for the older scholars.  On account of my youth the teacher did not advance
me, and I went again and again through the old Spelling-book, and learnt by heart what was
called the 'fore part of the book'--some dry rules of orthography, which never conveyed the
slightest idea to my mind, although I repeated them, parrot-like, without missing a word, and
which the teacher never thought of explaining to me.  From the spelling-book I was in time
promoted to the New Testament (not as easy reading as might have been selected, by the way).
This was followed by the American Preceptor, and subsequently by Murray's 'English Reader,'
a work reserved for the most advanced scholars.

"My brothers did not go to school during the summer months, for their services were then required
to assist father in his work; and I, too, had to leave school every day at eleven o'clock to
carry their dinner to them at the place, a mile and a half distant, where they were clearing
a portion of the Minot estate.

"When brother Horace was thirteen years old he was taken out of school, as the teacher could
instruct him no longer.  I was kept at home also, and brother taught me, giving me lessons
in arithmetic and penmanship, which studies had been prohibited me at school.  Here commenced
a most tender attachment and sympathy between brother and I.  As there were two children--Barnes
and sister Arminda--between us, our difference of years had hitherto kept us somewhat apart;
but after brother had been for several months my instructor we were from that time the nearest
in heart in our large household.

"I think that mother must have entirely regained her spirits during the four years that we
lived in Vermont, for I remember that men, women, and children alike delighted in her society,
and our house was the centre of the little neighborhood.  We resided very near the school-house,
and rarely did a morning pass without a visit from some of the girls, to have a few words of
greeting from mother on their way to their lessons.  When recess time came, they would arrive
in numbers to spend the time with her, and beg for a song or a story from the inexhaustible
supply with which her memory was stored, and there they would remain, fascinated by her sweet,
low voice until she would be obliged to playfully chase them out of the house to compel them
to return to school.  From the teacher, for tardiness, punishment was a very frequent occurrence,
but it made slight impression upon the girls in comparison with the enjoyment of listening
to one of mother's thrilling or romantic stories, for the following day they would return to
our house to again risk the penalty.

"I told you that brother taught me after we were taken out of school. He was the gentlest and
kindest of instructors, and was always ready to lay down his own book to help me out of any
difficulty that my lesson presented, although it was by no means easy to make him close his
book under other circumstances; such as the solicitations of his young friends to join them
in a game.

"I have described father to you as a stern man in his every-day intercourse with us, but although
his motto was 'Work,' he was always willing to grant us a holiday or a play-hour, when he thought
we had earned it.  He would relax his dignity, too, somewhat when young people came to pass
the evening with us; would encourage us to play games and dance, and would often join us; for,
although he never played cards himself, nor would he allow them to be played in his house,
he himself taught us how to dance.

"When our young friends came to see us, there was much rejoicing from brother Barnes, who was
full of life and spirits, and always ready to play, and from Arminda and myself; but brother
Horace, not at all allured by blind-man's-buff or a dance, would retire to a corner with a
pine knot (for in those days candles were few), preferring the companionship of his book to
our merry games.  Coaxing was all in vain: the only means of inducing him to join us was to
snatch away his book and hide it; but even then he preferred to gather us quietly about him
and tell us stories.  I remember that before he left home he had related to us, among other
things, the thousand and one stories of the 'Arabian Nights,' and 'Robinson Crusoe.'  This
gift of story-telling he inherited from mother, whose talent in that line certainly equalled
that of the beautiful Sultana Scheherazade herself.  At this time, although I had never seen
a copy of Shakespeare, I was familiar with the names and plots of all his imaginative, and
many of his historical plays, which mother would relate to us in her own words, embellished
now and then with bits of the original verse, as she sat at her spinning-wheel, or busied herself
about the household work.

"It was, I think, at this same time--our last year in Vermont--that a large ball, for young
people only, was given in our neighborhood.  Much speculation was excited among our young friends
as to whether Horace would dance at this ball, and especially if he would fetch a partner with
him.  It was the general opinion that he would not, as he did not bear a high reputation for
gallantry.  Great, then, was the astonishment of all present when Horace entered the ballroom
with Anne Bush, the prettiest girl in the neighborhood, upon his arm.  He opened the ball with
her, and his deportment quite silenced those who had questioned his appearance.

"Before long, preparations for another journey were in progress. Father had earned money sufficient
to buy some land, and I heard that we were going to Pennsylvania.  I was, however, too young
to be much impressed by this news, and it was not until I saw mother once more in tears that
its importance was apparent to me.  This time mother wept as bitterly as before, for not only
was she to be separated by a greater distance from her family in New Hampshire, to whom she
was fondly attached, and from the pleasant circle of friends she had made in Westhaven, but
her darling among us children, her beautiful eldest boy, of whom she was so proud, was to be
left in Vermont."

June 26.

Gabrielle and I have just returned from spending the day at Croton Dam. A large party from
the prominent families of Chappaqua was organized by Miss Murray, the pretty daughter of one
of our neighbors, and at nine o'clock a number of carriages, packed to overflowing with young
people and lunch-baskets, and led off by a four-horse wagon, started caravan-wise from the
place of rendezvous, Mr. Murray's elegant grounds.

The drive was a very pretty one, skirting for some distance the beautiful little lake that
supplies the great thirsty city of New York; and the spot chosen for the picnic--shady, terrace-like
heights, with a gradual slope to meet the water, and a rough bench here and there--was declared
the most suitable place in the world to lay the cloth.  One or two members of the party remained
behind to unload the carriages, count the broken dishes, and estimate the proportion of contributions--many
people fetching salt in abundance but forgetting sugar, whilst others furnished elaborately
frosted cakes, but omitted such necessaries as knives and forks.  Meantime, we climbed the
stone steps leading to the waterworks, and after a glimpse of the seething dark-green water
through the heavy iron grating, we hunted up the overseer and asked him to unlock the doors
for us, that we might have a nearer view.  He assented, and admitted us very obligingly, giving
us meantime a graphic description of the yearly journey of the Inspector in a boat down the
dark passage to New York, and pointing out the low narrow place of entry from the water-house
where they must lie down in the boat.

Dinner hour is generally a most interesting moment in a picnic, and this was the time when
the young gentlemen showed their gallantry by partaking only of such viands as had come from
the baskets of their favorites among the young ladies.

A cloth was spread upon the ground; seats were extemporized for the ladies out of carriage
cushions, waterproofs and wraps; the knives, forks and plates were dealt out as impartially
as possible, and we passed a very merry hour.

When the repast was over, the party dispersed--some to play croquet, others to row upon the
lake, or to stroll about under the trees; some young ladies produced books and bright bits
of fancy-work, while Gabrielle, Arthur and I, with our pretty captain, Miss Murray, and one
of her attendant cavaliers, decided to pass away the time by playing a game--no trivial game,
however; neither "consequences" nor fortune-telling, but an eminently scientific one entitled
"Twenty Questions."  For the benefit of the uninitiated I will remark that the oracle chooses
a subject (silently), and the others are allowed to put twenty questions to him to enable them
to divine it--usually commencing with "Is the object that you have in your mind to be found
in the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom?"

Gabrielle is very clever in this somewhat abstruse game, for she possesses her mother's spirit
of inquiry and love of reasoning, and she passes entire evenings with Arthur, pursuing the
most perplexing and intangible subjects.  She and Arthur are admirably matched in this game;
for if she is unparalleled in the quickness with which she will follow up a clue and triumphantly
announce the mysterious object, after asking eighteen or nineteen questions, Arthur is no less
adroit in selecting unusual subjects, and so artfully parrying her questions as to give her
the least possible assistance.  I often hear them call to each other--

"I have chosen a subject; you will never in the world guess it!"

Then follows an hour of questions and reasoning, with inferences drawn and rejected, and a
display of sophistry that would do credit to a more fully fledged lawyer than Arthur is at present.

Yesterday, after dinner, they launched into one of their games, and Gabrielle guessed after
eighteen questions what would have required forty, I am sure, from any one else--the eighty-eighth
eye of a fly!

Another was even more puzzling.  The object belonged, Arthur assured her, to the vegetable
kingdom, the color was white, and he had often met it within a dozen yards of the railway station.
"A daisy," was the first and natural solution, but she was, he assured her, very far adrift.
"A telegraph post," she next announced, but she was again unsuccessful.  At this point I left
them; but after an hour had passed Gabrielle ran up to my room to tell me that she had guessed
it--a polka dot upon one of her morning dresses!

The object chosen by Arthur at the picnic was the right horn of the moon.  Gabrielle, this
time, sat beside me and enjoyed the perplexity of the questioners, for not until we were about
to step into the carriage to return home did they guess it.

June 27.

A letter this morning from our pretty cousin Evangeline, announcing that she is engaged to
a Dr. Ross of Chautauqua county, where she lives.  Evangeline is the only daughter of mamma's
youngest sister, Margaret.  She is eighteen years old, of medium height, and well formed, with
a fair complexion, the chestnut hair that is peculiar to the younger members of the Greeley
family, and brown eyes inherited from her father's family, for the Greeley eye par excellence
is blue. Although Evangeline has been brought up in the quiet little village of Clymer, she
has been well educated, and besides being uncle's favorite among his nieces, she was much admired
in general society during the winter that she spent with us in New York two years ago.  At
uncle's birthday party, which she attended, she was by many pronounced the handsomest young
lady present.

We have never seen Dr. Ross, but mamma remembers his family well, and says that "he comes of
a good stock."  He is not wealthy, but he is in a good profession, is of unexceptionable character,
and very devoted to our dear Evangeline; so they have my blessing.  The marriage will not take
place until December, when Evangeline will have laid off her mourning.

Marguerite's portfolio is open upon her writing-table, and a letter to Evangeline, not yet
sealed, lies between the blotting-sheets.  As it speaks of Evangeline's betrothal, I will insert
it here:

"CHAPPAQUA, June 27.

"DEAREST EVANGELINE:--You complain in your last letter that I do not write enough about Chappaqua
and 'the farm.'  You wish particulars.  My sweet cousin, I thought that you were familiar with
descriptions of this dearest spot on earth, as I remember that dear uncle gave each of us a
copy of his 'Recollections' the last Christmas that you were with us--the last Christmas indeed
that he spent upon this earth.  Peruse that volume, dear, for in it you will find a more vivid
picture, a more poetic description of his dearly loved home and surroundings, than anything
that I can say.

"As to Chappaqua being a large or small village--it is small, very small, not half so large
as Clymer, where you live; but it is far more picturesque.  There are only a dozen or two houses
in all, including a couple of stores, a post-office, a 'wayside inn,' and a church without
a bell.  There are, however, many fine residences scattered over the township; whichever way
we drive, we see elegant mansions nestling in a copse of wood, or crowning some hill-top.

"The valley through which we approach Chappaqua is faced on either side by a succession of
beautiful undulating hills that are thickly covered with dark-green foliage.  This farm, consisting
of eighty-four acres (for you know that there is another lying adjacent of nearly the same
size), presents very beautiful and varied scenery.  Near the house in the woods, where uncle
and aunt lived so many years, a pretty brook winds down by the lower barn, and goes singing
away through the meadows bright

  "'With steadfast daisies pure and white.'

But this is not all; this lovely, babbling brook fills a large pond, high up in the woods,
then flows over a stone dam, and comes rushing down in a succession of waterfalls, stopping
for breathing-space in one of the wildest story-telling glens I ever saw.

"And here, in the gloom of the forest-trees, where the birds love to congregate, and a thousand
perfumes of clover and new-mown hay, and the aroma of the evergreen grove, come up, Ida and
I spend many an hour, forgetful of city life, and heedless about ever returning to it.

"This year we are occupying the roadside house, which, although not so beautiful as the new
one on the side-hill, nor so retired and romantic as the one in the woods still is lovely and
has a very charming prospect.  It stands on sloping ground that is skirted by forest and fruit
trees.  Some of them throw their grateful shade on the piazza and balcony that run the width
of the front of the house.  My room opens on the balcony by three French windows, and here
I often walk to catch the last gleam of departing day, or linger after nightfall to see the
far-away stars come out.  The moonrise here is perfectly enchanting, climbing up as it does
over the eastern hills, and throwing its pensive light over the silent meadows, and distant,
dark woods.

"But I have filled my sheet before speaking of your engagement.  As I have not seen your handsome
doctor, you will not expect me to be enthusiastic.  I hear that he is intelligent, clever in
his profession, and of excellent character, but not rich.  Well Evangeline, you know I approve
of wealth, combined with other good qualifications; but if I had to choose between a man of
mind and a man of money, I don't think I would hesitate long which to take; so you are sure
of my approbation, and you have my best wishes for your future happiness.

"Your loving cousin,

"MARGUERITE."

June 29.

A visit yesterday from our friend Mrs. Sarah L. Hopper, the clever contributor to several Southern
journals.  Among them the Washington Gazette, and the True Woman--the latter an anti-suffrage
journal. Mrs. Hopper not only writes well; she is also a woman of varied and excellent reading,
and the appreciation of the modern classics is displayed in one of her poems--an admirable
apostrophe to the character and works of Dante.  This poem, which was published some time since,
Mrs. Hopper once recited to us, and both mamma and I were struck with the true ring of poesy
so apparent in it.

June 30.

Upon returning from church yesterday, we found the front door standing open, a couple of arm-chairs
upon the piazza, and a newspaper or two in lieu of the occupants--proof unmistakable of a masculine
invasion.  Who it was we could not imagine; that it was not a neighbor we were convinced by
seeing the morning Herald and Times, for the Sunday papers cannot be obtained here, save by
being at the depot when the interminable way-train comes up from New York, and waylaying the
newsboy who accompanies the cars; and for this our neighbors are rarely sufficiently enterprising.
Unmistakably our visitors had come from the city.

Upon questioning Minna, she gave us a graphic description of the gentlemen.  One was "tall,
oh so tall! with dark hair and red cheeks"--in him we recognized Mr. Walworth Ward--the other
was a blonde gentleman whom she had seen here before.

"Lina has already made wine padding," she said, seeing Ida about to descend and inspect the
larder.  "Miss no fret--all right."

Ida and I then started to walk to the grove, where we thought we would probably find our guests
awaiting our return.  Not there, indeed, but in the vegetable garden we found them, where they
were kindly looking after the interests of the family by weeding the strawberry-beds, regardless
of the Sabbath, and notwithstanding one of the gentlemen was a grandson of a D.D.  In answer
to our regrets that we should have been absent when they arrived, they mildly intimated some
surprise, one having telegraphed his proposed coming, and the other sent a message through
papa the day previous; dear papa, however, had as usual forgotten to deliver the message, and
whither the telegram went, no one could imagine.

July 1.

A visit yesterday from the little colored sculptress, Edmonia Lewis. Miss Lewis was accompanied
by a box of formidable size, containing, she told us, a marble bust of Mr. Greeley, which she
had brought out here for the opinion of the family; but as Ida was in the city where she had
gone for a day's shopping, we reserved our judgment until she should return and see it with us.

I was very glad to learn that Miss Lewis was prospering in both a pecuniary and an artistic
point of view.  She had, she told me, received two orders for busts of uncle--one from the
Lincoln Club, and one from a Chicago gentleman.  She intends returning to Rome before long.

Miss Lewis had already opened a studio while we were in Rome four or five years ago, and I
heard much talk about her from her brother and sister artists.  I intended at one time to visit
her studio and see her work, but several sculptors advised me not to do so; she was, they declared,
"queer," "unsociable," often positively rude to her visitors, and had been heard to fervently
wish that the Americans would not come to her studio, as they evidently looked upon her only
as a curiosity. When, therefore, I did see her for the first time (last summer), I was much
surprised to find her by no means the morose being that had been described to me, but possessed
of very soft and quite winning manners. She was amused when I told her what I had heard of
her, and remarked, quite pertinently:

"How could I expect to sell my work if I did not receive visitors civilly?"

Miss Lewis expressed much gratitude to Miss Hosmer and Miss Stebbins for their kindness to
her in Rome, and of Miss Cushman she said enthusiastically, "She is an angel!"

She is, I have been told, very well received in society abroad, and when baptized a Catholic
in Rome, two ladies of high position, Countess Cholmondeley and Princess Wittgenstein, offered
to stand godmother for her.  Edmonia chose Lady Cholmondeley, whom I remember well in Rome
as a great belle and a highly accomplished woman.  She wrote poetry, I was told, and modelled
in clay with much taste, and her finely trained voice and dainty playing of the harp I well
remember as one of the attractions of Miss Cushman's receptions.

Edmonia has, beside her somewhat hard English appellation, two pretty baptismal names--Maria
Ignatia.

July 2.

This morning we have had a family picnic at the side-hill house, where the amusement was, however,
neither "Twenty Questions," gossip, nor croquet; but arranging and cataloguing uncle's large
library.  The books had hitherto been kept in the house in the woods, with the exception of
those in daily use, filling three good-sized bookcases in our present residence; but as the
house in the woods had been twice broken into last winter, Ida thought it safer to move them
all down this summer to the side-hill house, where Bernard sleeps.  Accordingly, a wagon-load
or two was brought down the other day and deposited in the dining-room, and this morning, as
we had no guests, and no very pressing occupations, we all, including Minna, went up there
directly after breakfast to look them over.

"I am resolved," Ida had said, "to have the books catalogued, that I may know in future how
many I yearly lose by lending them to my friends."  Consequently the work was doubled by the
necessity of writing down the names, and we had unluckily chosen the hottest day that we had
so far experienced for this laborious task.  We all went to work, however, with as much energy
as though the temperature was at a reasonable degree, and I felt quite proud of my achievements
when the work was done, having catalogued, myself, over three hundred volumes.

Our work was divided: mamma read off the names of the books, and Marguerite and I wrote them
down, and Minna then dusted and carried them into the next room to Ida, who placed them upon
the shelves, dividing the library into compartments for poetry, biography, science, fiction,
etc.  An endless task it seemed at first to sort the books, for more than one thousand volumes
of all sizes and in every variety of binding from cloth to calf, had been thrown promiscuously
on the floor, and the hottest antagonists in the political and religious world were now lying
side by side in the apparent enjoyment of peace and good-will.  "Slavery Doomed" and "Slavery
Justified" composed one externally harmonious group, while "Footfalls on the Boundary of Another
World," "How I became a Unitarian," and Strauss' "Life of Jesus," lay beside their rigidly
orthodox neighbors, the "Following of Christ," by Thomas à Kempis, Cardinal Wiseman's "Doctrines
of the Church," and a Jesuit Father's idea of the Happiness of Heaven.

Uncle's fondness for his country home was manifested by thirty or more large volumes upon Agriculture,
and several others upon Rural Architecture, while his literary and aesthetic taste was displayed
by a superb edition of Macaulay, in eight octavo volumes, combining the whitest of paper and
the largest and clearest type, with richest binding; Lord Derby's translation of the Iliad,
Mackay's "Thousand and One Gems," a large and elegant volume of Byron's complete works, and
Bryant's "Library of Poetry and Song"--the two latter beautifully bound and illustrated.  Xenophon,
Herodotus, Josephus, and Caesar lay off at an aristocratic distance from their neighbors, and
looked down with scorn upon anything so modern as Noel's "Rebellion," or Draper's "Civil War
in America;" while memories of the buried "Brook Farm" arose from the past as mamma took up
a volume or two upon Co-operative Associations.

Uncle's strict temperance principles were illustrated by half a dozen volumes upon the "Effects
of Alcohol," including "Scriptural Testimony against Wine;" and a work or two upon the Tariff
Question recalled many a Tribune editorial penned by the dear, dead hand.

A large dark pile of some twenty volumes loomed up from a distant corner--Appleton's useful
Cyclopaedia--and beside them lay an enormous Webster's Dictionary, handsomely put up in a chocolate-colored
library binding.

Many elegantly bound volumes were presentation copies from their authors--among them a magnificent
album of languages, beautifully illuminated, and bound in scarlet morocco, containing the Lord's
Prayer in one hundred different tongues.  This book sold, Ida said, for one hundred dollars a copy.

In striking contrast with this gorgeous volume were two little yellow-leaved, shabbily bound
books, valued, however, at one hundred dollars each, and treasures which no money could have
bought from uncle--one a copy of Erasmus, dated Basle, 1528, and the other "The tvvoo Bookes
of Francis Bacon on the Proficience and Aduancement of Learning, diuine and humane," printed,
the fly-leaf states, at London, in 1605.

July 3.

I have not yet, I believe, spoken of more than one or two of the pictures that uncle bought
while in Europe the first time.  He then spent ten thousand dollars on paintings, a piece or
two of sculpture, and a few little curiosities of art in the way of mosaics and antiquities
from different ruins of Italy, which, for a man who was by no means a Stewart or an Astor,
showed great liberality.  Uncle could not afford, like ostentatious millionnaires, to dazzle
the public with paintings bought by the yard; but for a man of his means he displayed, I think,
a true love for art and a strong desire to encourage it.  His purchases, too, were very different
from the second-rate pictures so often purchased abroad by uncultivated eyes, for instead of
depending merely upon his own judgment, he asked the assistance of the sculptor Story in choosing
his souvenirs; and his collection, though small, is admirable, containing two or three bonâ-fide
old masters, purchased at the sales of private galleries in Florence and Rome.

The pictures, like the books, have been kept hitherto in the house in the woods, but this spring
Ida moved them all to the roadside house that we might constantly enjoy them, and the parlor
now presents quite the appearance of a museum.  It is over the music-room, and its long French
windows open upon a balcony, from which we daily admire our tender, Italian-like sunsets. 
To the right it is overhung by the branches of our favorite apple-tree, from whose clusters
of tiny fruit we each chose an apple some days since.  Gabrielle then marked them with the
owner's initial cut out of paper, the form of which we will find in the autumn indelibly impressed
in the apple's rosy cheek.

But to return to our museum.  Upon ascending the stairs one's eyes first rest upon the "very
saddest face ever painted or conceived," as Hawthorne describes the beautiful Cenci.  While
in Rome I resided upon the Piazza Barberini, opposite the palace containing this exquisite
painting, and I visited it with a devotion almost equalling Hilda's. Much excitement prevailed
that winter in art circles concerning the authenticity of this picture, and hot discussions
took place wherever the believers and unbelievers chanced to meet.  No possible proof existed,
one party would declare, that Guido had ever painted Beatrice Cenci; and no one had thought
of it as other than a fancy head until Shelley had aroused the interest of the public in the
half-forgotten tragedy of poor Beatrice's sad life by the sombre drama, "The Cenci." From that
time, they say, caprice has christened this picture Beatrice Cenci, and Hawthorne has added
much to its interest by the prominence he gives it in the "Marble Faun."  They, however, are
unable to find the traces of sorrow, the "tear-stained cheeks" and "eyes that have wept till
they can weep no more," so eloquently described by all writers and art-critics of the present
day; and so far I agree with them--the face does not impress me with such depths of woe.

Their opponents, however, hold the time-honored tradition that Guido painted Beatrice in her
cell upon the morning of her execution, or as she stood upon the scaffold--for there are two
versions of the story--and that the gown and turban which she wears were made by her own hands
on the night preceding the fatal day.  But no words of mine can give a fair idea of this celebrated
painting: I will transcribe Hawthorne's description of it.

Next to the Cenci a St. Francis hangs, his hands devoutly folded and his head bowed in pious
meditation upon the sufferings of his Redeemer, whose figure bound upon the Cross lies before
him.  The skull at his feet and the dreary landscape surrounding him indicate his hermit-life
of isolation and penance.  The Saint is dressed in the coarse brown habit of a mendicant friar,
and his face is luminous with that gentleness that distinguished his character after his conversion;
for it is recorded of him that he would step aside rather than harm the smallest insect.

Above St. Francis is one of the most precious gems, historically and intrinsically considered,
of the collection.  The picture is small--only cabinet size; but it is none the less valuable
on that account, when we reflect that it dates from the sixteenth or early in the seventeenth
century.  It is a portrait of Galileo painted from life by Andrea Bartone, and was bought at
a sale of the Santi Gallery.  Only the head and bust are represented--the latter clothed in
a dark-brown open vest, with a scarlet mantle thrown over the shoulders; but the face is one
that would not easily be forgotten--a rugged, powerful face, with great, earnest eyes, scant
hair well sprinkled with gray, and deep furrows lining the dark brow.

Over the doorway, opening into the room that was formerly Aunt Mary's, is an antique marble
medallion of Juno, the haughty Mother of the gods; this was dug up near Tusculum.

Next comes an exquisite Madonna and Child by Carlo Dolce (a copy).  The mother's face is youthful
and radiant with divine beauty: the Infant Jesus stands upon her knee, and extends a plump
little hand in benediction.

Next, a portrait of uncle painted in 1839--two years earlier than the one that hangs in the
dining-room.  This picture, mamma says, was an excellent likeness of him when he was twenty-eight
years old; and the biographers who are so prone to describe him in his younger days as having
been "uncouth" and "awkward," would be, I think, much startled if they could see it.  His coat
is black, with a black tie, like other gentlemen, and his air, instead of being "rustic" or
"gawky," is expressive of gentle dignity, while his face, so often described as plain, is to
me beautiful enough to have represented a young saint.

Next these pictures is another medallion--the "Mother of the Gracchi," and under them a small
table upon which stand several marble curiosities: a model of the tomb of Scipio, Minerva issuing
from the head of Jupiter, and two busts of Roman soldiers in the time of Titus--antiques, and
quite yellow and valuable.

In the centre of the parlor is a round table bought in Rome, and made of variegated marble
taken from the ruins of the palace of the Caesars.

In a corner, upon a handsome pedestal, stands Powers' bust of Proserpine, of which uncle was
especially proud.

A very prominent picture, and one that was a great favorite with uncle, is an original portrait
of Luther, by Lucas Cranach, one of the great lights of the Flemish school of painting.  I
have seen in the Dresden Gallery the counterpart to this picture, painted by the same artist,
but representing Luther after death.  I much prefer the animated expression of the living picture,
for it is hard to think of the fiery reformer as dead, even at this late day.

Over the sofa is a large Holy Family, a painting in the school of Raphael, and underneath it
hangs one of our most valuable pictures--a veritable Guercino, painted in 1648.  The subject
is St. Mary Magdalen.

I wish that I had time to write in detail of all the beautiful things in the parlor--a card-table
made like the centre-table of classic marble from the ruins of Rome, an exquisite moonlight
view of a Benedictine Convent upon the Bay of Naples, with a young girl kneeling before the
shrine of the Madonna; a Venetian scene--the Doge's palace with its graceful, Moorish architecture;
St. Peter and St. Paul; the Cumaean Sybil, a beautiful female figure whose partly veiled face
seemed full of mystery; St. Agatha, and an Ecce Homo.  There are still some more marble medallions
that I have not mentioned; several valuable antiques, portraits of Alexander the Great and
Tacitus, and a bas-relief representing the flight of Aeneas--the former found near the Appian
Way--and two others that are comparatively modern--likenesses of Pope Clement XI., and Vittoria
Colonna, the gifted Italian poetess of the fifteenth century.

But I have not yet spoken of the pearl of our museum.  This piece of sculpture was not one
of uncle's Italian purchases, nor does it date back for centuries, but it is priceless to us,
especially as it is, we believe, the only copy now existing.  I allude to the bust made of
uncle in 1846 by Hart, the Kentucky sculptor.  This bust was the first work of importance that
Mr. Hart had ever executed, for he was then in the first flush of manhood, and the early vigor
of that genius that has since wrought out so many beautiful creations.  Then, however, he had
not modelled his fine statue of Henry Clay, ordered by the ladies of Virginia, nor had he even
dreamed of his lovely "Triumph of Woman" that when finished will send his name down to posterity,
as our greatest creative American sculptor.

Mamma was living with uncle when Mr. Hart arrived in New York with a commission from Cassius
M. Clay to make this bust, and she has often told me all the circumstances of the sittings.
Uncle was then, as ever, extremely busy, and it was very difficult for him to give Mr. Hart
an occasional half hour for a sitting.  As ordinary means failed, Mr. Hart brought his clay
and instruments to The Tribune office, and there he worked whilst uncle rested from his daily
editorial labors; but even while "resting," his lap was full of newspapers, and he could not
afford the time to "pose," for his eyes were rapidly scanning their columns.

"I never," said mamma, "knew an artist to make such a study of another's face as Mr. Hart did
of brother's.  He was not content with a mere sitting from him now and then; he visited him
at the house; he watched his face in company, and attended every occasion when he spoke in
public, that he might model him, he said, in his best mood. Consequently the bust was the most
perfect likeness that had ever been made of brother, and as his face was then delicate and
his features so classic in their cut, it was, I thought, the most beautiful piece of sculpture
that I had ever seen.  It was quite a revelation to dear brother, who in his modesty had never
had an idea of his own beauty."

Ten plaster busts were struck off for the family and a few intimate friends, but as none of
them were ever put into marble, they have all, I believe, with the exception of this one, been
destroyed.  Mamma's copy was overthrown by Marguerite's little hands when a child; another
belonging to one of our cousins was broken by her little son; and although Cassius Clay's copy
was buried, Mr. Hart told me, during the war to save it from the hands of the soldiers, he
had no reason to suppose that it finally had escaped the fate of the others.  Aunt Mary, however,
in her anxiety to preserve her copy, at once enveloped it in linen, and packed it in a box.
Consequently it is now as perfect as the day it left the studio; but mamma had never seen it
from that time until this spring, when Ida exhumed it from the store-room.

Mr. Hart and uncle were always warm friends, although Mr. Hart left for Europe soon after completing
this bust, where he has since remained, with the exception of a flying visit to America about
twelve years ago.

July 5.

Yesterday was the pleasantest Fourth I ever experienced in America. Last year at this time
I was upon the Catskill Mountains, and was aroused at an unearthly hour by the discharge of
a cannon, whose reverberation was something appalling, and made me doubt if I was not shot.
The hotel was graced with the presence of some thirty or forty children, whose fond parents
had invested largely in fire-crackers and toy cannon for them, and no place upon the grounds,
it seemed, was so favorable for the ebullition of youthful patriotism as the spot directly
under my window.  Consequently, as I was already weak from the effect of a prolonged attack
of nervous fever, I was before nightfall in a state akin to distraction, and filled with anything
but patriotic sentiments.  I could not then but think with regret of a previous Fourth spent
upon the steamship St. Laurent, where fire-crackers were tabooed, and the celebration consisted
entirely of a magnificent dinner, and speeches--during the latter I made my escape to the deck.

This year was pleasanter still.  I do not know if the Chappaqua people are less patriotic than
other citizens of the Union, but our nerves were only disturbed by the occasional popping of
a fire-cracker in the garden of our neighbor, the train-master over the way; and when we strayed
off to the Glen after dinner, we were as free from disturbing noise as though our country had
not been born ninety-seven years ago. But although noisy demonstrations do not seem the fashion
here (perhaps owing to the predominance of Quakers in the neighborhood), the dormant enthusiasm
of the people for the Fourth was aroused at sundown, when a mass meeting was held at the tavern,
or "Chappaqua Hotel" as it is grandly styled, and lengthy and energetic speeches were delivered.
From our piazza we could hear the orators' voices ascending to a very high key as they warmed
with their topic, and quite congratulated ourselves that we were not obliged to be of the audience.

After dark there was a small display of Roman candles and sky-rockets; and so ended the glorious
Fourth.

July 6.

I have again dreamed away an entire morning upon the piazza of the house in the woods--to me
the stillest, sweetest spot in the world.  I have described this dear old house and its romantic
surroundings again and again since I have been here this summer.  I can scarcely turn over
half a dozen leaves of my journal without finding some allusion to it; but it is a subject
possessing such fascination for me that I must again revert to it.  I like to pass a quiet
hour upon the steps of the piazza, or upon the large moss-grown boulder in front of the house
where Ida, Raphael, and Gabrielle have all played; and while my fingers are busily employed
with some fanciful design wrought with gold thread or emerald-green silk,

  "My thoughts wander on at their own sweet will,";

oftenest returning, however, to Aunt Mary's life here in the woods with her little children.
A lonely, comfortless life many women would have deemed it, so entirely shut in as she was
from the outer world; and to any one less self-reliant and self-sustained than Aunt Mary it
would have been so.  For that there were discomforts in her country life I do not doubt, although
they were much lessened by uncle's easy circumstances; and the house itself was finished off
with all the city improvements and conveniences practicable to introduce into a building of
its size and situation.  Still, the house was distant from good markets, and the trees encircled
it so closely that the sun's rays did not penetrate the rooms until ten o'clock; but Aunt Mary
loved her trees as though they were human, and at that time would not allow one to be cut down,
notwithstanding the dampness that they created.  An idle woman would have regretted the distance
at which the house stood from the public road, as no distraction ensued from looking out of
the windows; and a timid or nervous one would have dreaded the long nights in that solitary
house when uncle was in the city or absent upon lecturing tours, and no neighbor was within
calling distance in case of danger.

Occasionally, too, Aunt Mary would be left without servants, for all American ladies know how
difficult it is to retain them in the country, especially in so small and lonely a place as
Chappaqua was then, and although she frequently had some friend making her long visits of months,
still there were days when she would be alone with only the sad memory of her buried darlings,
her splendid Pickie, the pride and hope of both parents, and sweet little Mary Inez, and her
two living children, too young to be very companionable.

Raphael, mamma says, was a beautiful boy, although not perhaps so noticeable as Pickie, for
he had not his brilliant color, and his hair, too, was not so dazzling in shade, but very much
like his father's. His features, however, were quite as finely cut as those of his much admired
brother, and his temperament was gentle and loving.  Ida cherishes very tender memories of
him, for he was the only brother whom she knew, and her constant playfellow before Gabrielle's
birth.  There were seven years difference in the ages of the brothers.  Pickie died at five,
of cholera; and Raffie at seven years old, of croup.

But although Aunt Mary had such sad memories in the past, she had two beautiful children left
to her, and for them she lived this life of seclusion at Chappaqua, remaining here six months
of every year that they might acquire a fine physical development from walking, driving, and
riding in the pure country air.  Ida has often told me of the wild games of play she used to
have when a child with Osceola, a little Indian boy, and dwelt especially upon her prowess
in racing down hill in emulation of him.  The parents of this boy then occupied the roadside
house, which did not at that time belong to uncle.

Gabrielle's stories are different.  She loved to ride the unbroken colts, and tend her menagerie
in the play-house.  She has, too, much to tell about the way her mother used to train her to
be as fearless in case of fire or thieves as she was when seated upon a bare-backed horse,
and often she has made me smile, though fully recognizing the wisdom of Aunt Mary's lessons,
when telling me how she was obliged to rehearse imaginary escapes from fire or midnight attacks.

Besides a devoted love for her children, a passion for the beautiful in Nature, and fondness
for solitude and books, or the companionship of some one person of congenial tastes and highly
cultured mind, Aunt Mary possessed a fund of moral strength and heroism that one might indeed
read in the flash of her black eyes, but which a casual observer would think incompatible with
her frail figure.  It was, however, many times severely tested during uncle's absence when
she had no male protector to whom to look for assistance: but then she proved all-sufficient
in herself.  At one time a number of workmen were employed upon the place--rough, sullen creatures--who
used to come to her to receive their pay; and knowing her, a delicate, sickly woman, to be
there alone, they would often clamor for more wages than they were entitled to receive, but
never could they frighten her into granting it, for though generous and charitable, nothing
was more repugnant to her feelings than an attempt to take an unfair advantage of her.

Upon one occasion, a man with whom she had had some business transactions came to claim a payment
that was not due him.  Aunt Mary explained to him that he was not entitled to it, and refused
to see him again.  He returned another day, and she would not allow the door to be opened.
He then remained outside pulling the bell and thumping for admittance.  Aunt Mary spoke to
him from the balcony above, and requested him to leave.  He vowed he would not stir without
his money, and tried to coerce her by the most frightful threats and oaths.  "When his imprecations
were at their highest, Aunt Mary descended, and throwing open the door, told him to come in;
then turning to Gabrielle, who stood beside her, said:

"Go upstairs and fetch my pistol off from the bureau."

Upon hearing these words the man left very quickly, and never returned again to annoy her.
In relating this incident to me, Gabrielle said:

"Of course I knew perfectly well that I would find no pistol upon the bureau, but I had been
too well trained by mamma to show the slightest surprise, and promptly went upstairs in quest
of imaginary firearms."

But this exhibition of cool courage paled in contrast with the true heroism of Aunt Mary displayed
at the time of the terrible anti-draft riots in July, 1863.  Living in the retirement of the
woods, she was not in the habit of going down to the village or associating with the neighbors;
consequently, she was rarely informed upon the local news. She wondered that no letters or
papers had arrived for a day or two, but merely supposing that some accident upon the road
had delayed the mails, she went about her ordinary occupations, perfectly unconscious of the
peril she was in.  Finally, Mr. Quinby, a Quaker neighbor, came to the house by a long circuit,
and informed her that a mob of about three hundred men, who had collected from Sing Sing and
other parts of the country, were drinking at the tavern, and threatening to sack "Greeley's
house," and hang the family to the nearest trees.  It was at the risk of his life that Mr.
Quinby had come to warn Aunt Mary, and he implored her to escape as quickly as possible, and
offered to conceal her and the children in his house.

Aunt Mary did not shriek or fall down in a fainting fit upon learning that hundreds of desperate
men were threatening her life.  Although she had been very ill and was still weak, perfectly
cool and collected, she considered what was best to be done.  Her husband was in New York,
and of the dozen or so Irish laborers employed upon the place, two or three had already been
seen drinking amicably with the rioters, and the others, as well as the Irish servant, she
feared to trust Clark, the overseer, a very competent Englishman, was an excellent shot; but
what could one man do against three hundred?  As for saving herself by deserting her house,
Aunt Mary scorned to do it; but immediately devised a plan that reminds one of the heroism
of a Dame Châtelaine of the Middle Ages.

First of all, the valuables were to be moved, but without exciting the suspicions of the servant
or workmen, as they might inform the rioters. The men were accordingly sent off to a distant
part of the farm to work, and the maid kept busy, while twelve trunks were lowered into a wagon
standing at the back of the house.  Mr. Quinby immediately covered them with hay, and drove
to his own house, where he stored them until the trouble should be over, and then sent his
son back to help the family.

To Gabrielle's surprise, her mother and Ida now appeared in very voluminous and housewifely
looking aprons, and were constantly going up and down stairs.  At last an untimely draught
blew Aunt Mary's apron aside, and Gabrielle, who had not been informed of the danger, caught
a glimpse of the picture of the Archangel Gabriel.  All of the pictures and pieces of sculpture
were then removed to a little hut in the orchard near the stables, built in the side of a hillock,
half under ground, and quite overgrown by vines; and when both pictures and the precious books
were safely out of the house Aunt Mary felt that she could breathe.  By that time Clark had
returned from Sing Sing, where he had purchased a large amount of gunpowder by Aunt Mary's
direction. This he arranged in a train from the house to a distant point, and the preparations
were then completed.  When the rioters should come Aunt Mary was to speak to them from the
balcony and warn them to go away, and in the meantime Mr. Quinby and Clark were to take the
children out of the house by the back window, which was but a step to the top of a low woodshed,
from which they could easily get to the ground.  Then, while the rioters were storming the
barricaded doors, Aunt Mary was to make her escape, and when she and the children were at a
safe distance a match was to be applied to the gunpowder, blowing up alike house and rioters.

Mr. Quinby, being a Quaker, had looked on reluctantly while the mine was being laid, and when
he had done all he could to help Aunt Mary, he returned to the tavern to see the state of affairs
there.  He found the mob still drinking, and uttering horrible threats against the family.
His conscience then obliged him to give the wretches a hint of the doom that awaited them,
ending with these words:

"Heed my warning, my brethren; Horace Greeley is a peace man, but Mary Greeley will fight to
the last!"

After dark, the rioters came to the gates and howled, and uttered threats, but dared not approach
very close to the fortress armed by a sick woman and two children; and when weary of exercising
their lungs went peacefully away.  Meantime, Aunt Mary, being fatigued by the exertions of
the day, laid down, Ida said, when everything was in readiness to meet the rioters, and slept
peacefully till morning.

July 8.

While looking over a box of old letters and newspapers this morning I came across a little
sketch descriptive of our quartette, written last winter for a New York journal.  This sketch,
or "Pen Portraits," as it was styled, veils our identity under fictitious names, the initials
only being preserved, and although it passes over our imperfections and very much exaggerates
our accomplishments, still it contains, I think, so much that is characteristic that I will
preserve it by copying it into my journal.  The writer commenced with a description of mamma's
room in Cottage Place, and dwelt particularly upon a picture of uncle hanging over the mantelpiece,
but that portion of the sketch has been torn off and lost.

. . . . . . "But let us regard the living pictures.  You see that youthful group!  A group
to inspire a poet or painter!  They are four--they are cousins.  Two are orphans; you see a
resemblance to the face in the frame wreathed in immortelles.  We will first observe those
two that sit with arms entwined, smiling up into each other's eyes.  It is the gentle Lela[1]
and her cousin Majoli, belle Majoli we may call her.  These cousins are nigh the same age,
and their hearts beat in sweet accord.  And there is a certain likeness, spiritual more than
physical--for Majoli is taller and slighter, and fairer, too, if we reckon by the hue of the
hair and color of the eyes.

"Lela has soft, soliciting, brown eyes; Majoli is azure-eyed, laughing or languid according
to her varying mood.  Lela's face is pale as moonbeams; filial solicitude and divine sorrow
have left their chastening impression upon her exquisite lineaments.  Her countenance is Madonna-like
in purity, ingenuousness, and self-abnegation.

"Majoli's delicate features are untouched by pain or care, and though her spiritual countenance
is often tinged with melancholy, no harsh experience has traced those pensive lines.  'Tis
but the soul's limning--a musical nature is hers, emotional and imaginative.

"Lela's head is large, though not unfeminine, and the magnificent wealth of tawny-colored hair
reminds one of Guercino's Holy Magdalen. She has pretty, modest ways of looking down under
those pale, drooping lids with her calm, confiding eyes, and if the mouth is somewhat large,
the teeth are white and even, and the lips are coral-tinted.  The nose is straight and slender,
and suggests the chisel of Phidias, and from the expansive brow we infer a broad culture and
comprehensive understanding.  It is the seat of Philosophy, as well as the throne of the Muses.

"Majoli's head is smaller than Lela's, but its pose is aristocratic and graceful.  The blonde
hair is artistically coiffed, and though the features are not strikingly regular, there is
sympathy and great sweetness in the face, and art and refinement are expressed even by the
slim, pale hands.  An airy, lithesome figure she has, and the beat of her footfall is cadenced
to the measure of joyous music.  Frail she seems compared with Lela's well-rounded figure,
but if she has not equal strength, she has elasticity; and if more energy and power is indicated
by the physiognomy of Lela, Majoli has ambition and judgment to compensate.

"We have compared Lela's face to the rich portraiture of Guercino; Majoli's suggests the pencil
of that famous old Spanish master, Ribera, whose pictures of women were always a blending of
the elegance of a court lady with the simplicity and naïveté of a church devotee.  Half belle,
half religieuse we may style her.

"And on what have these dainty minds been nurtured, and who have been their intellectual mentors?
Lela has been bred within a cloister's walls, and foreign travel has polished both mind and
manners.

"In no school has Majoli's mind been formed, nor is she greatly indebted to learned professors
for her mental attainments.  A mother's love has quickened the budding intellect, a mother's
intelligence has trained and directed the unfolding powers.  The grace of foreign speech is
on her tongue, and scenes and pictures of distant lands are enshrined in her memory.  Ancient
lore has for her a peculiar charm; history is her delight; Plutarch, Josephus, Gibbon, Macaulay,
she has conned well.  Poesy she loves much.  The poetry of the Bible, Dante, Schiller, Herbert,
Browning, are her favorites.  In sacred books she finds sweet enjoyment.  The Fathers of the
Church afford her great pleasure; St. Augustine, St. Basil, Thomas à Kempis, etc.  She has
the grace of devotion, but her love of the Church is affected more by its aesthetical qualities
than its theological dogmas.

"Lela is a passionate book-lover.  There are few modern writers that have not furnished entertainment
to her accomplished mind, and she is not unacquainted with the best Latin and Greek authors.
English, German, and French literature are alike open to her.  Biography, essays, dramas, poetry,
with more serious reading, occupy her time. Virgil and Horace, Bacon, Shakespeare, Racine,
Victor Hugo, Heine and George Eliot may be mentioned as among her preferences.

"But while we are attempting to portray some noticeable characteristics in Lela and Majoli,
how are Celina and Guerrabella occupied?  You see Guerrabella has a pencil in her hand.  She
is sketching a head; if we look closely, we shall probably recognize our own, grotesquely drawn,
for there is no denying that our young genius is fond of caricaturing her friends.  Celina
sits by a table; her large, open eyes have a distant, dreamy expression.  Her pen moves rapidly
across the page; she is writing a Musical Recollection, we may presume.

"Guerrabella is the youngest of the group.  She is tall, picturesque, imposing.  Her face is
radiant with blushes, dimples, and smiles.  She looks so fresh and beautiful that she might
have set for Greuze's picture of 'Sweet Sixteen.'  A sense of thorough enjoyment flashes from
the bright, blue-gray eyes, and is indicated by the rose-bloom on cheek and lips.  There is
an air of strength and courage perceptible, and a certain dash in her manner that associates
her with Scott's favorite heroine, Di Vernon.  She has great mimic powers, and might adorn
the histrionic stage.  Towards art and literature she seems equally attracted, and what she
will eventually decide to follow we cannot now predict.  She will fail in nothing for want
of talent.

"Celina's height scarce reaches to Guerrabella's shoulder; her figure is fragile and dainty;
and though her cheek lacks bloom, the lines are soft and graceful, and the face pensive and
poetic.  The mouth is small and well curved, and the air of repose that rests upon the imaginative
brow resembles the Muse of Meditation.  The serenity that is uniformly spread over her unique
countenance is in strong contrast to the animated, vivacious features of her cousin.  Celina's
head is fashioned after a classic model, and the mass of amber-hued hair which crowns it might
be taken for an aureola.  Her pansy-like eyes are full of sweet, poetic vision.  The brow is
marked by delicately defined eyebrows, and the eyelashes are long and silken.  'Tis a melodic
countenance, foreshadowing that dream-world from which our young heroine has never for a moment
awakened.  Too petite, some might deem her, for womanly perfection; but physical symmetry,
ease, and a dignified bearing elevate the fairy figure to the true standard.  She moves about
with an airy grace, and nothing earthly is lighter than her footfall.  Her small, delicate
hands grace the keyboard, and music in her has an enchanting interpreter.

"Guerrabella participates in the family passion for literature.  She possesses great intellectual
independence, and her preferences are decided, usually inclining to the bold and strong.  She
is fond of Macaulay's 'Heroic Lays of Many Lands;' she rejoices in Becky Sharp; and there is
a tradition that she learned to read in the works of Thackeray, spelling out the words of that
magnificent novel, Henry Esmond.

"Celina has explored the treasures of classic lore in music and literature.  Homer, Herodotus,
Plato, she has read, with Tasso and his chivalrous lays, and Spenser and his stately verse.
In music, Glück and Grétry, Beethoven and Boieldieu's dulcet tones have helped to fashion her
musical mind.

"But we must not dismiss our heroines without indicating the toilettes that most become them.
Velvets and rich brocade befit the Lady Lela's superb figure.  Scarlet is her color, and diamonds
her essential ornament.  The moss-rose should be her favorite flower.

"Soft gray or pale azure of light fabrics do best agree with Majoli's sylph-like form.  Pearls
and feathers are consonant to her artistic taste.  Her emblematic flower is the lily, of sacred
and legendary lore.

"All shades and fabrics of whatever texture harmonize with Guerrabella's style.  Ample should
be the folds that habit her majestic figure, and brilliant the gems that are to rival her flashing,
sparkling eyes: yet we might indicate couleur de rose as best blending with her own exquisite
tints, and the opal with its mysterious light as in some way prefiguring her genius and high
destiny.

"And how shall we vest our mignonne--Celina?  Gossamer tissues, fabrics of airy texture--a
magic web for the daintiest Lady in our Land.  No color of human invention; their dyes would
oppress her. White with a gleam of moonlight upon it; a reflection of the aura of her hair,
or the first pale beams of the morning.  Other gems would I not but those wondrous starlike
eyes, to light up a face radiant with thought and sensibility."

July 10.

"Auntie, is it possible," said Gabrielle, indignantly running into mamma's room with an open
volume in her hand, "that papa was as homely and awkward when a boy and young man as this writer
describes him? 'Tow-head,' 'gawky,' 'plain,' and 'clownish,' are some of the most uncomplimentary
epithets applied to him.  He is described as having 'white hair with a tinge of orange at the
ends,' and as 'eating as if for a wager;' while grandpapa, the writer says, was so poor that
papa had to walk barefooted over the thistles, without a jacket, and in trousers cut with an
utter disregard of elegance or fit, and it was remarked that they were always short in the
legs, while one was invariably shorter than the other.  Was it possible that grandpapa could
not afford an inch more of cloth to make poor papa's trousers of equal length, and was it true
that papa never had but two shirts at a time until he came to New York, and that he never had
any gloves?  When he was an apprentice in Portland every one used to pity him, Mr. ------ says,
as he walked shivering to the Spectator office on cold winter days, thinly clad, and with his
gloveless hands thrust into his pockets to protect them from being frost-bitten!"

"My child, you overwhelm me with your questions," said mamma.  "Let me take them singly, and
I will do my best to refute this writer's unpleasant statements.

"First as to personal appearance.  You say he styles your papa 'plain' as a boy.  That is absurd,
for his features, like mother's, were as perfect as a piece of Grecian sculpture.  'Tow-head'
is also a mis-statement.  Brother's hair never was at any time tow-color, and the tinge of
orange at the ends existed only in the author's imagination. Tow-color, you know, is a sort
of dirty white or gray; whereas brother's hair, until he was thirty years old, was like Raffie's,
pure white.  After that time, it commenced to change to a pale gold-color, which never, however,
deepened into orange.  What was your next question, my dear?"

"About papa's wardrobe," said Gabrielle, her cheeks still flushed with excitement; "were you
indeed so miserably poor, auntie?"

"We were certainly very poor after father failed," said mamma firmly, "but we were by no means
reduced to abjectness.  I can never remember the time, in our poorest days, when the boys had
not, besides their brown linen work-day shirts, cotton shirts for Sunday, and father his 'fine
shirt' to wear to church and for visiting.  Your papa was dressed suitably for our station
in life--neither better nor worse than the sons of neighbors in our circumstances.  As for
going barefoot, all country boys at that time did so during the summer months; your papa was
not an exception.

"You speak of his gloveless hands.  I never saw a pair of kid gloves worn by farmers while
we lived in Vermont or Pennsylvania; and certainly they would have been very inappropriate
for a boy-farmer or a printer's apprentice to wear; but brother was always, both at home and
at Poultney, supplied with warm woollen mittens of mother's knitting. As for the cut of his
trousers, I am surprised that any sensible author should use so unfit a word as 'elegance'
in speaking of a poor farmer's clothing.  I told you the other day that our wardrobe for every-day
wear was spun, woven, and made by mother, and it is not to be expected that home-made coats
and trousers should have the cut of a fashionable New York tailor; but they were, at all events,
warm and comfortable. That brother's trousers were always short, and especially in one leg,
is an absurd fabrication.  The story may perhaps have risen from some one who remembers his
lameness in Poultney, when he acquired the habit of dragging one leg a little after the other,
and that style of walking may have apparently shortened one of the trouser legs.  Have you
anything else to ask, little one?"

"Yes, auntie," said Gabrielle, smiling at mamma's methodical way of answering: "was papa an
awkward boy, and did he eat vulgarly?"

"I have told you, dear," mamma replied, "how we were brought up.  I never saw your papa eat
ravenously while he was at home; for father was a despot at table, and any appearance of gluttony
would have been quickly checked by the dreaded descent of his fork upon the table.  I think
it probable that later in life, when your papa became a distinguished man, and every moment
was of value, that he did eat quicker than was consistent with the laws of etiquette, but not
when he was a boy.

"As for his awkwardness, I can readily imagine that a boy so intensely preoccupied would not
appear in so favorable a light to strangers as one who should seek the society of people rather
than books, and a superficial observer might have mistaken his air of abstraction for rustic
bashfulness.  You know that he was always absorbed in a book from the time he was three years
old.  Father would often send him to do an errand--to fetch wood or the like; he would start
very obediently, but with his eyes upon his book, and by the time he had reached the door he
would have completely forgotten everything outside the page he was reading, and it was necessary
to send some one after him to remind him of his errand.  He certainly was very unlike every-day
boys, not only in appearance, but in habits and moral qualities.  Never did I hear a coarse
or profane word pass his lips; the purity of his soul was radiant in his beautiful modest countenance;
while his slender, boyish figure, with the ponderous white head poised upon his long, slim
neck, always reminded me of a lovely, swaying lily."

"I have seen recently in some book," said Marguerite, "that uncle was never at his ease in
polite society.  This I think very absurd.  To be sure he had not the manners of a dancing-master,
but--"

"Yes," interrupted mamma; "this statement is another of the usual exaggerations current about
brother.  As you say, he had not the manners of a dancing-master, and when importuned and annoyed
by shallow people, may often have been abrupt with them; but when in society, I have always
seen his company as much or more courted than that of any other person present, and have never
known him to shrink or be embarrassed in the presence of people of distinction or rank.  Few
men have, I think, been more misrepresented, though often with the kindest intentions, than
my dear brother."

"You spoke of papa's lameness while at Poultney, Aunt Esther," said Ida, looking up from a
letter that she was reading; "pray how did he become lame?  Was it serious?  I do not remember
hearing him mention it."

"It occurred, I believe, in this way," said mamma.  "Whilst your papa was in the Spectator
office, he chanced one day to step upon a rough box, which turned over, and hitting him upon
the leg, inflicted a cut below his knee.  At first, brother thought it a mere scratch not worth
noticing; but when he subsequently took cold in it, he found it very troublesome, and although
he then consulted several medical men, they were unable to cure it, I do not remember hearing
that he was ever confined to the house with it--probably because he could not afford to give
up his work long enough to have it properly treated; but for two or perhaps three years he
limped to and from the office.  When he went subsequently to Erie, Pennsylvania, to work as
a journeyman printer, the wound, which had partially healed, had again opened, and was very
painful.  Some old woman residing there, however, gave him a simple remedy which soon cured
it permanently."

"From whom is the letter that you are reading, Ida?" inquired Gabrielle, putting up her father's
biography in a bookcase; "does it contain a request for a loan of $500, or is it an offer of
a home in a Christian family?"

"Neither, for once," answered Ida.  "It is from The Tribune office, and contains a slip cut
from the Omaha Bee, headed, 'Horace Greeley upon Girls.'  It appears that a lady, Miss Hewes,
who did not know papa personally, wrote to him to ask if he recollected his first school-house,
and a former playmate of his, named Reuben Nichols, whose acquaintance Miss Hewes had just
made.  Here is papa's answer, dated Washington, 1856.  Let me read it to you, Aunt Esther,
and tell me if you think it is genuine."

"'MISS HEWES:--As I do not know you, and am little interested in any but a part of your letter,
you will allow me, in my terrible hurry--having two days' work that ought to be done to-day,
while I must leave at evening for a journey to our Pittsburg Convention--to speak only of that.

"'I very well remember the red school-house in which I first began to learn (the paint was
worn off long since, and it was very far from red when I last saw it); I remember the Nichols
children, who lived, just below the school-house, in a large house.  But I was very young then,
and I do not make out a clear mental picture of Reuben Nichols.  I think he must have been
considerably older than I.  But I recollect one Aseneth Nichols, one of two girls not much
older than I, whom I thought very pretty, so that while I was a very good speller, and so one
of the two at the head of the first class in spelling, who were entitled to "choose sides"
for a spelling match; I used to begin by choosing these two pretty girls who couldn't spell
hokee to save their souls.  Well, this was found not to answer; I knew enough to spell but
not to choose sides; so the rôle had to be altered, and the two next to the one at the head
had the honor of "choosing sides."  Ask Mr. Nichols if he had a sister Aseneth, and if he remembers
any such nonsense as this.  My kind regards to him.

"'Yours,

"'HORACE GREELEY.'"

"I don't believe," said Gabrielle, "that papa ever wrote that letter."

"It does not sound much like him," rejoined Marguerite, "with the exception of 'Yours, Horace
Greeley'; what do you think, mamma?"

"The letter is characteristic," was mamma's reply; "the style is his, but there are several
words that I have never known him to use; however, they may have been illegible in the original,
and their place supplied by the printer's ingenuity.  I remember hearing father and mother
often speak of Reuben Nichols who lived near grandfather in Londonderry, and I believe that
he had a son named Reuben, and a daughter named Aseneth, so the letter must be genuine, I suppose."

"Was it true, mamma?" inquired Marguerite, "that uncle was fond of little girls?  You know
it has been said of him that he was as a man quite indifferent to women."

"Yes, he was very partial to little girls," was mamma's reply, "when they were pretty and gentle.
Not, however, in the love-making way of the present precocious generation, but he liked to
talk to them, and relate stories from the books he had read.  Perhaps the secret of his preference
lay in the fact that they made more attentive and sympathetic listeners than his rough boy-friends.

"I told you the other day that at the ball he attended when thirteen years old, he was the
escort of Anne Bush, the prettiest girl in the village.  She was perhaps a year younger than
he, and as I remember her, extremely pretty--a slender figure, cheeks like roses, blue eyes,
dark hair, and very gentle, ladylike ways.  She had a sister Sophie, who was as plain as Anne
was pretty; and a wild, mischievous girl, but my inseparable and dearest companion.

"There were two other girls of whom brother was very fond at that time; Cornelia Anne Smith
and Rebecca Fish.  Cornelia Anne was older than the other girls, about fourteen, I think, and
was the fondest of learning of the trio.  I remember that she often used to bring her school-books
to brother when some difficulty had arisen in her lessons, and he would explain the hard points.
I think that he always corresponded with these girls, and visited them occasionally after they
became women, for you know with what tenacity he clung to his early associations.  He has often
spoken to me of Rebecca Fish, who is now Mrs. Whipple, of Fairhaven.

"You would be amused if I were to tell you how he used to pass the time that he spent with
these three girls.  A city-bred boy of thirteen or fourteen would have been quite capable of
arranging an elopement with the prettiest one, but brother's style of courtship was quite unique;
he used to correct their grammar when they conversed, and gravely lecture them upon the folly
of wearing stays!

"The corsets which so aroused his ire were quite different from those of the present day. 
At that time, you must know, the Empire dress, that you have seen in portraits of the time
of the first Napoleon, was all the fashion; no crinoline, skirts so extremely scant and gored
that they clung to the figure like drapery upon a statue, and waists a finger and a half in
depth, with inch-wide bands instead of sleeves. This style of dress was very graceful and becoming
when worn by a woman of slender figure, and those who were not thus favored by Nature made
the best of their figures by wearing what was then called 'busks,' or more popularly 'boards.'
The corsets worn in those days did not clasp in front, but merely laced behind, and inserted
in the lining of the front was the 'busk,' a piece of steel, or (among poorer people) wood
two inches wide, and the depth of the corset.  This busk, with the addition of very tightly
drawn lacing-strings, was supposed to give great symmetry to the figure.  No village belle
ever liked to own that she laced tightly, or that she wore a board; as it was a tacit admission
that her figure could not bear unaided the test of the Empire dress; consequently brother's
remarks would be received by his young friends with an injured air, and a vehement protest
against such a false accusation.  Brother would then test their truth by dropping his handkerchief
and requesting them to pick it up; if they 'wore a board,' stooping would be impossible, or,
at all events, very difficult; an ordeal that would cover them with confusion, when the philosopher
of thirteen years old would resume his moral lecture upon the laws of hygiene, and the follies
of fashion."

July 13.

Going to the post-office for the morning mail is, I think, our greatest daily pleasure.  For
some reason, we seldom have many letters by our second mail, the 6.30 P.M. train, but in the
morning our box is always well filled, for we receive regularly the dear daily Tribune, six
weekly journals, and the leading magazines, and as we all have quite a number of correspondents,
we feel deeply aggrieved if our box is not filled to repletion at least once a day.

Ida, of course, is blessed with the greatest number of letters in the family, for besides those
from her own and her father's friends,

  "The cry is, still they come!"

in shoals from unknown people of high and low degree, sometimes containing merely poems, or
expressions of sympathy and interest in the sad history of our beautiful cousin, but varied
occasionally by some of the extraordinary appeals for help which I have already mentioned.

This morning I went down to the office when the mail came in.  There was the usual number of
expectant faces--Miss Murray and Miss Cox in their carriages, and our more rural neighbors
standing about the pigeon-hole; however, every one makes way for us in Chappaqua, and I approached
nearer, and asked for our letters.  A very rough-looking man standing near by, looked on with
interest while the postmaster handed out letter after letter, and finally said:

"You belong to the family, do you not?"

"Yes," I said, for I always answer the rustic salutations of the people about here, knowing
them to have had a sort of feudal attachment to uncle.

"I thought a great deal of the old gentleman," he said with a rude pathos in his voice that
was very touching.  "I used to see him very often, for I live in these parts, and he always
used to say good-morning so pleasant, and was never ashamed to shake my dirty, hard hand!"

This reminds me of a little incident that mamma related yesterday.  She was standing upon the
balcony when an old gentleman who was driving past, seeing mamma, stopped his horses, looked
up and bowed, hesitated, and then said:

"Excuse me, but is thee the sister of Horace Greeley that was?"

Mamma assented.

"I thought so," he said, "I saw it in thy countenance."

He then told mamma his name, and, after making a few remarks about uncle that showed thoroughly
good feeling, drove on.

It is not uncommon for those driving past to slacken their horses and gaze earnestly at the
house, and, if any of us are upon the piazza or at the windows, they always bow--a mark of
respect that is also shown us by all the farmers and working people about here.

But I am forgetting Ida's letters.  I brought her this morning as many as six or eight, some
of which were put up in yellow-brown envelopes, and directed in very questionable chirography.
In a few moments she knocked at mamma's door and said,

"I have brought you a few letters from some of my extraordinary correspondents, Aunt Esther."

"We will compare notes, my dear," said mamma, looking up from a rose-colored sheet embellished
with decidedly scrawly writing.  "I have just received one that is quite astounding."

"From Tennessee," said Ida, looking at the postmark.  "I know the writing; that man has sent
me as many as half a dozen letters, wishing to enter into correspondence.  I suppose that finding
me so unresponsive he thinks he will try another member of the family."

"He comes to the point in a most emphatic manner this time," said mamma, "by asking me for
your hand; and as the letter is really a curiosity in a literary point of view, I will read
it to you." [1]

"NASHVILLE, TENN.

"MRS. JOHN F. CLEVELAND:--I reckon I am one of the spoilt children of the South, similar to
what Mr. Greeley says of South Carolina.  I want to Marry Miss Ida, because she is the daughter
of the most powerful Man that has yet appeared on the American Continent.  Mr. Greeley turned
four millions of slaves loose with the Pen can't I win his daughter with the same facile weapon?
Now Mrs. Cleveland won't you help me?  I am not a Humbug, I have too many bullet holes through
my body to be classed with that tribe of insects.  I begin to feel a little skittish about
my age, 35 and not yet Married.  Yet I have always been rather a fatalist and incline to Worship
some star.  The Greeks Worshiped the sun, And moon under the Name of Isis and Osiris, but I
am more like the Arab look to the stars for something sublime and unchanging among all the
bright lights that hang and move in the firmament.  The North Star Appears to be the most important.
The Axis on which our Earth daily turns.  The point from which all Mariners calculate their
course in mid ocean, and safely guides Them from continent to continent.  Without the North
Star there would be no Magnetic Meridian by which Governments could be surveyed and divided
equitably to its inhabitants and civilization would lose its strong hold in being based on
Justice.  If there is any South Star that plays such an important part on this continent or
Europe I have never heard of it.  Miss Ida is the North Star made so by the fact her father
was the great center around Which The whole country swung.  And As she is the oldest the crown
of greatness ought to rest on her head.  And if she will Marry Me I will do as hard fighting
as Caesar did to put it there.  With great respects yours Truly

"------ ------."

This letter would have excited more astonishment than it did, had it not been only a fair specimen
of what Ida has been daily receiving since her father's death.  She then read us one from Indiana,
addressed to herself, and written, as the newspapers would say, with a view to matrimony, but
couched in quite a business-like strain:

"MISS IDA GREELEY:

"May I not surprise you by the fact that I desire an acquaintance with you.  I send you my
photograph (which however is too light to be perfect), hoping yours in return.  If answered,
I in my next will give my age and history generally.

"Yours truly

"------ ------."

Another was from a widow with a son at college, who was very badly in debt.  The mother appealed
to Ida as a lady of fortune and generosity, and the only person to whom they could look for
aid, to pay the son's debts, "And," Ida added with mock indignation, "she does not even promise
that I shall be ultimately rewarded with the young man's hand."

A third was dated Illinois, and bore the sonorous signature of Greeley Barnum M------.  This
epistle was extremely prolific, inasmuch as it gave the occupations, ages, and a personal description
of not only the immediate members of the writer's family, but even extended to cousins once
or twice removed.  He had also much to say about his name of Greeley; sometimes he was proud
of it, and sometimes the reverse, according to the company he was in.  Passing over all this
prelude, we discovered that Greeley Barnum M------'s object in writing was to request a complete
outfit for his sister who was about to go to school. "You are a young Lady, Miss greeley,"
the writer touchingly said, "and know everything that my sister would be likely to want." 
The clothes, he kindly intimated, could be put up in a box, and sent by express, prepaid; and
having done so, Ida was requested to notify his sister and also an uncle and aunt at some distant
point, that they might not be distressed by thinking their niece was going to school without
a suitable outfit.

The next letter that Ida took up was from a Kansas man, more modest in his requests than the
others, for he neither asked for her hand nor a loan, but being anxious for self-improvement,
solicited a little assistance from her in that line.  This letter was written in an even, flowing
hand, with very few mis-spelt words.

"WICHITA, KANSAS.

"MISS IDA GREELY:

"Well, here is another fool, will no doubt be the first thought that will pass through your
mind, and it is quite likely that you may in the main be correct.

"I have a very high regard for all womankind.  I have read so much about your sympathetic nature,
I thought perhaps our sympathies might be mutual in some respects.

"I am always desirous of improving, and have heretofore looked to much to persons no better
qualified than myself to instruct or improve in correspondence of any kind.  Knowing that you
are educated and refined I apply to you as a perfect Gentleman for a small portion of your
time say one half-hour in four weeks as a time set aside to answer any letter I might write,
at same time corract misspell'd words etc.  And do it unreservedly.  I am formerly from the
east: come west less than one year ago, have lost my wife, am thirty years old, and like you
without friends.  In return for your favor I can write you a description of this great Arkansas
Valley and county beyond, of the rapid growth of the country etc. which may in part repay you
for your trouble to please one lonely heart far from home.  Will not give you any description
of Self or business unless I receive some answer but will say that I am of good family, in
good business, and doing well.

"With respect

"------ ------."

"Here is another letter that at all events is short," said Ida, continuing to read:

"MISS GREELEY:

"For some years past your father very kindly gave me assistance during three months of the
year; if you can continue this, it will be a great charity, as I am very much in need of it.

"Yours respectfully

"------ ------."

"Have you not yet exhausted your mail?" enquired Gabrielle.

"No," said Ida, "I have still two or three letters to read to Aunt Esther.  Here is one in
which you will be interested, Gabrielle.  The writer calls you familiarly 'Elite': I think
he must have read that very accurate description of you that went the rounds of the papers
last summer, in which you remember you are a shy and shrinking flaxen-haired fawn.  He would
be quite surprised, I think, if he could see what a majestic 'Elite' you are."

"ALLEGHANY CO. PENN.

"To whom it may concern:

"Know ye that I have had a desire to know more about the Greeley girls for several months,
and that the desire for acquaintance became so strong after meeting your father and sister
a few nights since (while sleeping) that I concluded to write.

"It seems to be Gabrielle's acquaintance I particularly desire, but she being young and inexperienced
I address you as her natural guardian, allowing you to dispose of my communication as you think
best.

"Being what some folks call an eccentric individual; feeling lonely in the world, and believing,
from what I know of the laws of Hereditary Descent and your parents that you and your sister
must possess the noblest natures; and believing that no harm but good--at least to me--can
come from our acquaintance, I write to ask a correspondence.

"If you or 'Ellie' feel like sending a reply--well; if not, there shall be no hard feelings,
but it would be a satisfaction to me to know that my letter had been received.

"Sincerely wishing you and all the world all happiness, I close. Accept my warmest sympathy
in your bereavement, and believe me to be the friend of Humanity.

"VICTOR MELVIN.

"P.S.  For reasons not necessary to mention, I write under an assumed name.  Write, PLEASE."

The next one was from Chicago, addressed to Miss ida greeley.  The writer said:

"I am about to pen you a few lines, hopeing you will not receive them in a contemptious manner,
but rather in a business than a formal way.

"Pleas to put the form of introduction and society regulations aside, and consider your future
happiness, pleasure and welfare only.  I am well aware that you are very much anoid and persecuted,
thereby I mean persistant attentions from undesirable persons; now my obgect at present is
to aid you in a manner that you can soon and forever shut down on all disagreeable attentions.

"now I would suggest some beautiful locality in California or orogon there to live a quiet
retired life free from former acquaintances and continnad anoyances.  now if you think you
could accept my services, they are honorably tendered and would be kindly and heartily given.
Pleas to inform me at the earliest conveniance.  Pleas to not misinterpret my intentions.

"yours in sincerity

"pleas to

"Address -------- --------."

After listening to this extraordinary epistle, mamma said dryly:

"I think, my dear, that that is the strangest letter you have yet received."

"It is nothing, auntie," was the reply, "to one I have in reserve, in which the writer not
only has a request to make, but actually proposes making me a present; it is not, however,
his hand, for a wonder!"

"DEERLODGE, MONTANA.

"To MISS IDA GREELY:

"Young lady I suppose you will be surprised at receiving a letter from the frontier, my motive
for writing is this.  I am a mountaineer--that is a trapper a good many years ago I met with
your father Horace Greely on the plains, and greatly admired the old gentleman.  The way I
came to make his acquaintance is this.  A drunken, unruly Cuss seeing that your father appeared
quiet and peaceable thought it safe to play the bully at his expence so he commenced to insult
and threaten Mr. Greely in a pretty rough manner.  Seeing that your father was quiet and peaceable
and did not wish to quarrel with the Cuss I took the Cuss in hand, and spoiled his beauty for
him, and taught him a lesson to mind his own business.  Mr. Greely greatly overated the trifleing
service I had done, he thanked me warmly, he became very friendly with me and gave me good
advice.  Among other things he advised me to do was to get a breach loading rifle instead of
my muzlle loading rifle.  I laughed at the idea I supposed my old muzlle loader was the best.
Since then I have found out that Mr. Greely was right and that I was rong.  Mr. Greely at the
time offered to purchase one and give it to me I refused to accept it.  He then told me any
time I changed my mind to let him know, and he would send me a good breech loading rifle. 
I have often thought about it since, but never wrote to him.  My reasons for writing to you
now are these; I and my partner Beaver Bob started down the Yellow Stone last fall to trap
near the Big Horn river.  We were pretty successful and made the Beaver mink martin and other
vermin suffer--but one day we were attaced by a hunting party of 15 or 20 Ogallala Sioux. In
the fight my old partner Beaver bob was wiped out I was wounded but managed to make my escape
and after a pretty hard time reached the Mission on the head of the Yellow Stone--I mean near
the head.  I lost my horses all my outfit in fact almost everything.  When my ammunition was
expended--I mean used up--I threw my rifle away and took to the brush and ran for it--I mean
the chance of life.  Lately I have heard that Mr. Greely has handed in his chips--that is passed
in his checks--I mean gone to limbo you know.  I'm sorry for the old man but we must all go
some time you know.  and now miss what I want to know is will you instead of your father send
me a breech loading rifle.  If you do I shall be much obliged to you and if you don't I hope
there is no harm done.  The kind of rifle I want is one of Sharps new improved shooting rifles
with a barrell 36 inches in length and a barrell 16 pound weight Calibre 44.  They are mad
in Sharps factory Connetticot in a place called Hartford.  If one was sent to me by Wells and
Fargoes express to Deerlodge city Montana Territory, I should get it.  The name or rather the
nickname by which I am known among mountain men is Death Rifle.  The redskins I mean the Indians
gave me that name many years in Dacotah Territtory and it stuck to me ever since.  My right
name is Hugh De Lacey so when you wish to adress or direct any thing to me direct to Hugh De
Lacey, Deerlodge City, Montana.  Miss Greely a great many eastern men we remarked seem to think
that we mountaineers are to blame for having trouble with the redskins I can assure you we
never bother the infernal vermin only when they bother us and that is pretty often for when
they get a chance to go for our hair they take it no more at present I remain

"Yours respectfully

"HUGH DE LACEY.

"N.B.  I have heard you eastern ladies are in the habit of useing a deal of false hair in your
toilets if you choose miss Greely I will send you a lot of Indians hair any time you want it.
I remain yours respectfully

"HUGH DE LACEY."

"It reads like a chapter from one of Cooper's novels," said mamma, "and the romantic name of
Hugh De Lacey would be more appropriate to the handsome young descendant of some old Huguenot
refugee family than such a rough trapper as your correspondent 'Death Rifle;' but the present
he offers you is most singularly inappropriate; no one who had ever seen your wealth of hair,
my child, would think of presenting you with a chignon;" and as she spoke she loosened and
shook out Ida's heavy clusters of hair, which, released from their orderly Marguerite braids,
swept over her black dress like a tawny mantle.

[1] I insert this and the subsequent letters precisely as they are written, merely withholding
some of the signatures.

July 14.

"Aunt Esther, in all the stories of your early days that you have told us, you have not yet
described your life in Pennsylvania," said Ida one evening, when we were gathered about the
piano.  "Do tell us about it. You have once or twice merely alluded to living in the woods,
and my curiosity is quite excited.  Were they veritable forests?  I do not remember hearing
papa say much about them."

Mamma smiled sadly.

"What makes you think of Pennsylvania to-night, my child?" she asked.

"I do not know, auntie," was the reply, "unless perhaps it was hearing Cecilia sing 'My love
is like the red, red rose.'  You told me, I remember, that grandmamma used often to sing that
pretty little Scotch ballad."

"Yes, it was one of mother's favorite songs," said mamma.  "I can remember perfectly the way
she used to sing it.  Not in your English version, Cecilia, but with Burns' own Scotch words,
and in her sweet, low voice, with a ring of passion that one rarely hears in a drawing-room
at the present day.  As Charles Reade says of one of his heroines, 'She sung the music for
the sake of the words, not the words for the sake of the music--which is something very rare.'

"I am not surprised that you have never heard your papa say much of our life in Pennsylvania,
for you remember that he did not accompany us there, but only made us occasional visits.  Before
we left Vermont father had already apprenticed him, at his earnest desire, to the publishers
of the North American Spectator, at Poultney, and brother Barnes (who is fifteen months his
junior) then took his place in the household.  I think that your papa had been some time in
the Spectator office before our departure for the woods, in September."

"Yes," said Marguerite, who always remembers dates; "he was apprenticed the April before you
left, and came over to Westhaven to bid you all good-by.  I remember what he says of the parting
in his 'Recollections:' [1]

"'It was a sad parting.  We had seen hard times together, and were very fondly attached to
each other.  I was urged by some of my kindred to give up Poultney (where there were some things
in the office not exactly to my mind), and accompany them to their new home, whence, they urged,
I could easily find in its vicinity another and better chance to learn my chosen trade.  I
was strongly tempted to comply, but it would have been bad faith to do so; and I turned my
face once more towards Poultney, with dry eyes but a heavy heart.  A word from my mother, at
the critical moment, might have overcome my resolution.  But she did not speak it, and I went
my way, leaving the family soon to travel much farther and in an opposite direction.  After
the parting was over, and I well on my way, I was strongly tempted to return; and my walk back
to Poultney (twelve miles) was one of the slowest and saddest of my life.'

"Do commence at the beginning, mamma," Marguerite continued, "and tell us all about the journey
to Pennsylvania, and how your new home looked when you arrived.  How large was the family then?
Aunt Margaret was born in Vermont, was she not?"

"Yes, and a very pretty little creature she was," said mamma, with a sister's pride in the
youngest of the family.  "She was extremely small for her age--indeed, she weighed only three
pounds and a half at her birth, and I recollect hearing some one say that the nurse put her
into the family coffee-pot and shut down the lid."

"The coffee-pot!" we all exclaimed, in chorus.  "Pray how large was it? Somewhat over the ordinary
size, I trust."

Mamma laughed.  "Yes, it was larger than coffee-pots of the present day," she said; "an old-fashioned
tin coffee-pot, broad at the bottom and gradually narrowing towards the top.  But still it
was extraordinary that a baby could be put in it, and the lid shut down."

"What induced grandpapa to select Pennsylvania for a residence, Aunt Esther?" inquired Ida.
"Was land cheaper there than elsewhere?"

"You have answered your question yourself, dear," was mamma's reply. "Land was very cheap there,
and through our careful economy in Vermont, father had saved enough money to buy about two
hundred acres, to which he subsequently added, from time to time, so that the old Greeley homestead
now consists of between three and four hundred acres.  Then two of father's brothers, Uncle
Benjamin and Uncle Leonard, had settled in Wayne township three or four years previous, and,
to use your papa's words, had 'made holes in the tall, dense forest that covered nearly all
that region for twenty to fifty miles in every direction.'  Father went to Pennsylvania in
advance of us, bought his land, and then returned to fetch us to our new home.

"I remember seeing mother weep bitterly when she left Vermont; but, as ever through her brave
life, she made no complaint.  As for myself, I remember no regrets, save at parting with dear
brother; for I was too young to feel other than childish exultation at the prospect of making
a long journey; and that journey from Vermont to our new home upon the 'State line,' between
New York and Pennsylvania, I must here remark, occupied a month.  Locomotion, you see, was
not so rapid in the year 1826 as it is now."

"I should think not!" exclaimed Gabrielle.  "Pray, auntie, in what way did you travel to advance
at such a snail's pace?  I should think you could almost have walked the distance in that length
of time."

"You will be amused when I tell you the length of the first day's journey," replied mamma.
"Father hired a large wagon, and stowed away our trunks, furniture, and all of his family in
it, and we went as far as Whitehall, a distance of about nine miles.  Here we stopped over
night, and the next day took the boat for Troy, where we again broke the journey after travelling,
I believe, two days.  At that time there were no regular ferry-boats to cross the river from
East to West Troy, and passengers were taken over in row-boats.  I remember that the boatmen
stood by the river-side and called all day and night:

"'Over, over, over, going o-o-o-o-ver!' to attract custom.

"Now came the most delightful part of the journey--going from Troy to Buffalo upon the canal-boat.
There were two different kinds of boats that went between those cities; the packet-boats, carrying
the mails and passengers but no freight, and the line-boats, which took both freight and passengers,
and were consequently cheaper.  These were used by people like ourselves, who were moving from
one part of the country to the other, with furniture, who wished to economize, and to whom
time was no object; for the packet-boats travelled twice or thrice as rapidly as the line-boats.

"I think I never enjoyed myself so thoroughly when a child, as at that time.  My sisters and
I were much petted by the captain and the passengers; and the excitement of being on the water,
and the constant change of scene, kept up our spirits to the highest pitch.  Margaret, who
was then four years old, was, I remember, an especial favorite on the boat; for she was extremely
pretty, with her fragile, doll-like figure, her clear complexion, bright blue eyes, and reddish
gold curls. She inherited the family talent for spelling, and was very fond of displaying her
accomplishments in that line; for sister Margaret was a very self-possessed little creature,
and was afraid of no one--not even of father himself.  I recollect that when the boat stopped
at any small town to take on passengers, Margaret's bright eyes would if possible discover
a shop with the sign 'Grocery;' and then, going up to some one of her new friends, would gravely
spell 'G-r-o, gro, c-e, ce, groce, r-y, ry, grocery;' followed usually by an intimation that
a reward of merit would be acceptable.  She was so extremely small for her age, that her achievement
of spelling a three-syllable word was looked upon as something marvellous by the passengers,
and some one would immediately take her ashore, and buy her some candy or fruit from the grocery.

"Another incident that impressed itself strongly upon me during this journey, was eating a
peach for the first time.  I had never seen a peach in either New Hampshire or Vermont.

"But, during those long September days that we children spent running over the boat, and indulging
in all sorts of wild mischief, poor mother had by no means an easy life.  It was impossible
for her to keep us together and under her eyes; and what with the fear that we might fall overboard,
or meet with some accident from the bridges, I know that she only looked forward to the time
when the journey should be over, and we safe on land again."

"The bridges, mamma!" said Marguerite, "to what danger were you exposed from them?"

"The bridges crossing the canal," explained mamma, "were so extremely low, that no one upon
the boat could stand upright; often the boat could barely glide under them without grazing
the rails of the deck. The captain used to keep on the lookout, and as we approached one, would
call, 'Bridge ahead.'  Then the women and children would rush down the staircase to the little
cabin, and the gentlemen would usually throw themselves at full length upon the dock until
the bridge was passed.  That was always a moment of terrible anxiety for poor mother if we
were out of sight; for accidents and even loss of life had been known to occur; indeed, on
father's previous journey, he witnessed an accident of a most terrible character.  A woman,
who was going only a short distance in the boat, was very much afraid that she would be taken
past the town where she wished to stop, and paid no attention to the warning to go below as
they approached a bridge.  The captain, seeing the danger she was in, seized her by the arm,
and thrust her downstairs.  She rushed up, and he again pulled her down.  Confident that she
was about to be taken past her destination, the poor woman for the third time broke away from
him, and reached the deck just in time to be struck by the bridge and instantly killed."

"Frightful!" said Marguerite with a shudder.  "Tell us about the rest of your journey, mamma.
How did you travel after you left Buffalo? Upon Lake Erie, I suppose?"

"No, indeed!" replied mamma, "although there were at that time steamboats upon the lake; but
father had had so terrible an experience upon his previous journey, that he would not subject
his family to the caprices of Lake Erie.  He had started from Buffalo upon a schooner, but
a dreadful storm arose, in which the boat struggled for three days and was then obliged to
put back to Buffalo a complete wreck.  Father declared at that time that he would never expose
his family to the hair-breadth escape from death that he had undergone; consequently, he hired
a strong wagon at Buffalo, and we travelled along what was called the 'Lake Shore Road' to
the town of North East, whence we took a southern course to Wattsburgh.

"When at Wattsburgh, we were only eight miles distant from our destination, but as we were
now to leave the main road and plunge into the deep forest, father exchanged his horses and
wagon for a heavy wooden sled and a yoke of oxen.  Then we commenced to realize what our new
life was to be.  There was no road through the woods, and the only indication of the route
was blazed or marked trees.  Huge logs, so high that the oxen could barely step over them,
lay occasionally across our path, and from time to time we had to stop while father and brother
Barnes hewed down the trees that obstructed the way.  We children thought this pioneer episode
even preferable to our experience upon the boat, but I remember that dear mother sighed often
and deeply.

"At the close of the second day, the eight miles were accomplished, and we reached father's
property.  He had bought with the land a rough little log-house, or rather hut, as it had but
one room, and in this we were to live until he could build a better one.  At the sight of her
dreary home, mother's heart fairly sunk, and I shall never forget her tears."

Mamma paused for a moment; then steadying her voice, said:

"I am prouder than ever of my mother when I think how nobly she bore the separation from her
darling son, and her exile from her family, and, you may almost say, from civilization.  She
could not, at first, it is true, restrain her tears, but from that moment never a murmur of
complaint crossed her brave lips, and we children never dreamed, till years later, how keenly
she felt the sacrifice that she had been compelled to make."

"But were you really so far out of the world, Aunt Esther?" inquired Ida.  "Did you have no
neighbors at all?  We had two uncles there, I thought.  Surely they must have been some society
for grandmamma?"

"I do not believe," mamma replied, "that any other spot upon the globe, not even Robinson Crusoe's
island, could now seem so desolate and shut off from all communication as our home in the woods
did then.  You must remember that there were no railways in 1826, which fact made us still
more remote from the rest of the world.  Now, with the railways spreading in every direction
over our vast Republic, you can scarcely imagine what it was to live with an almost impenetrable
forest between yourself and your nearest neighbor.  Uncle Benjamin occupied what was called
the 'next lot,' and had the ground been cleared, the distance from us would still have been
three-quarters of a mile; but when the distance was increased three-fold by the darkness of
the forest, and there was in addition every probability of meeting a bear or two on the way,
you can imagine that being neighborly was scarcely practicable."

"Bears!" exclaimed Gabrielle, her eyes sparkling with excitement; "how lovely!  Darling auntie,
do tell us more about them.  It must have been like one of Captain Mayne Reid's stories, to
live in that delightful Pennsylvania!"

"Our life there," said mamma, "certainly equalled the wildest tales of adventures experienced
by early settlers that I have ever read, and we children found it quite as 'lovely' as you
imagine it to have been.  We never felt isolated, although our entire 'clearing' consisted
of only four acres, upon which our house stood, and any further prospect was shut out by the
woods.  To us it was delightful to realize the adventures of Robinson Crusoe, which, as I told
you, brother had read to us in Vermont, merely changing tropical animals and scenery for that
of the North.  I do not remember ever being afraid, but the wolves, who nightly howled in gangs
about our slightly built house, the bears who ate up the corn in our little patch, the porcupines
who gnawed the hoops off our pork barrels, and the frightful, screaming owls, struck terror
to poor mother's heart.

"I recollect that one night father went out to drive away a porcupine whose teeth and claws
he heard busily at work upon a barrel hoop, but the creature rushed into the house through
the open door, and ran across the trundle bed where sister Arminda and I slept.  I need not
tell you how dangerous it would have been had one of his quills penetrated our flesh."

"Do go on, auntie; this is delightful," said Gabrielle.

"When father had paid for his land," said mamma, "and bought a yoke of oxen and a cow--two
essential things for a farmer--he had very little, if any, money left.  There was no danger,
however, that we should suffer from want, for the woods were so full of game that father would
take his gun in the morning and go out to shoot something for dinner with the same confidence
that he would have gone to a market to buy it. Partridges and pigeons in the greatest abundance
formed our daily fare, while the deer used to walk into our corn-patch and almost offer themselves
as targets for father's or brother Barnes' gun.  Venison, I recollect, was so plentiful that
a farmer, after shooting a deer, would only trouble himself to fetch home the hind-quarters
and hide--the latter being marketable.  In the spring there were cowslips and other wood plants
in abundance, which made a delicious substitute for spinach.  Tea was very scarce with us,
and was kept for Sundays; but beech nuts, burnt and ground, made a very palatable coffee, that
formed our daily beverage.  Butter must have been an unmarketable article, for I remember that
during the first three years we spent there, it sold for six cents a pound."

"Did you grow anything on the farm to sell, mamma?" I inquired.  "I suppose not, during the
first years."

"'No," said mamma; "and if we had, there would have been no market for it."

"Then what did you do for money, Aunt Esther?" said Ida.  "Grandpapa had very little, you say."

"I must not forget," said mamma, "that we had one marketable production, and one that you would
not easily guess.

"I wonder, Gabrielle, if your favorite chemistry goes back so far into elementary principles,
as to tell you from what black salts are made? School-books seldom, I think, trouble themselves
with the origin of things, so I will tell you that after the great logs were burnt that father
had felled in clearing, the ashes were collected and leeched, and the lye boiled down in immense
cauldrons till it became granulated like sugar.  It then formed what was called 'black salts,'
and these salts are the basis of potash, soda, etc.  The salts could always find a ready market,
and with them we paid our taxes, and bought what necessaries we could not raise ourselves."

July 16.

An air of mystery has pervaded the house for the past week.  My offers to take Ida's letters
to the post, or to go and fetch home the mail, have been met with a hasty negative, and Minna
despatched forthwith to attend to them; and whenever I might enter Ida's room, it would appear
to be at a most inopportune moment, for the earnest conversation that had been going on between
herself and Gabrielle would instantly stop, and their countenances assume a most transparent
expression of indifference.  Long whispered conversations with mamma were continually taking
place, and Ida seemed to be more frequently called to the kitchen by Lina than I had ever before
known her to be, that autocrat being ordinarily by no means tolerant of her presence there.
Finally, Ida was summoned to New York upon important business--to meet her lawyer, I supposed,
but wondered why she did not simply authorize papa to represent herself, as well as Gabrielle,
whose guardian he is, and thus spare herself a tedious day in the city in such sultry weather.

Yesterday was my birthday, and to-day is Marguerite's.  As the fêtes occur in midsummer, we
are usually--if in America--upon the Catskill Mountains, or some equally inaccessible place,
so that a celebration is not practicable; indeed, our birthdays have not been celebrated since
1869, when some friends in Paris took us all to St. Germain, where we passed a most delightful
week at the Pavilion Henri Quatre (a hotel built upon the spot where Louis XIV. was born),
and daily drove and picniced in the grand old forest for which St. Germain is noted.  The events
of yesterday were therefore most unexpected and agreeable.

Ida and Gabrielle, after congratulating Marguerite and I, and giving us some elegant presents
(for we usually receive our presents upon the same day, as less than twenty-four hours separate
our anniversaries), asked us to drive down to the station with them to meet the train, and
gently intimated that as some one might come up from New York with papa, we had better put
on our best bombazines.  Quite obediently I went upstairs, put on the dress with its weight
of crape, clasped on my new black velvet ceinture, with its buckles of oxidized silver in delicate
filagree work, (Marguerite's gift), and obtuse to the inappropriateness of a dress fan for
morning use, suspended from the châtelaine another birthday gift--a black lace fan.  Then,
when I had put the finishing touch, in the shape of dear Ida's present--a vinaigrette of oxidized
silver formed like a half-furled fan--I was quite satisfied with my toilette; before the day
was over, however, my ceinture was adorned with a tortoise-shell châtelaine, whistle, and tablets,
as well as a dainty riding-whip--papa's present--and I deeply mourned the impossibility of
wearing two beautiful pictures, a new novel, and a large box of Iauch's best bonbons.

When the train arrived, papa emerged, followed by our artist neighbor, Mr. John Hows.

"Why, papa has brought up Mr. Hows!" I said.  "How very--" my exclamation of pleasure was checked
by surprise at the appearance of his brother, the musical editor of the Express, followed by
our friends, Dr. Taylor and Colonel Rogers.

"Is this a surprise party?" Marguerite and I inquired blankly.

My dear friend Lela Paraf then tripped out, assisted by her elegant husband, and followed by
Mr. Eugene Durkee and his brother, two Paris friends of ours.   Then the car door opened once
more, and "our young chief," as papa calls Mr. Reid, and Colonel Hay issued--a surprise party
indeed.

Ida had intended to invite only a few young gentlemen to spend the day with us, fearing that
if she sent out invitations to ladies to dinner, some enterprising reporter might announce
that she had given at least a fête champêtre, if not a bal masqué, which in our deep mourning
would not be an agreeable report to be in circulation; but Lela is so charming and dear to
us all, and has remained so faithfully my most intimate friend for the last six months, notwithstanding
the rival that I dreaded in her husband, that Ida made an exception for her.

As we were marshalling our regiment to return to the house, a tall, dark, distinguished-looking
gentleman, elegantly dressed, hastened towards us.  Who he was I could not imagine, but as
his face seemed familiar, I welcomed him with a beaming smile.  He must, however, be very near-sighted,
I thought, for he overlooked my extended hand, merely bowing very low, and going on towards
the house.

"Who is he, Ida?" I said in a whisper; "I don't remember his name."

"I suppose not," said Ida, laughing; "though you have seen him often enough.  It is Emile,
from Delmonico's.  I sent for him to help Minna serve the table."

I was no longer surprised that my distinguished-looking gentleman did not shake hands with me.

When we were upon the croquet ground, I had an opportunity to admire Lela's toilette.  A born
Queen of Fashion, her dresses even when as a school-girl were my admiration, and her toilette
for my birthday showed the refinement of delicacy and taste: for, not wishing to be the only
lady present in colors, she wore a black grenadine, with black bows and a black lace hat; her
diamond ear-drops and one half-blown deep red rose alone testifying that her mourning robe
was only worn through sympathy.

We had sat three hours at the table, and were lingering over the ices and awaiting the coffee
and fruit, when a shrill whistle, warning the guests that the train was nigh, caused a flight
more rapid than that of Cinderella.  Farewells were left unspoken, and "French leave" taken
in good earnest, as our friends made a short cut through the garden of Bischoff, the trainmaster,
who lives opposite us.  Their departure could scarcely be said to be graceful, but as they
had only three minutes' time to meet the train, it was obligatory.

Lina had exercised all of her art in preparing the birthday dinner, and as Ida gave her carte
blanche in her most extravagant demands--such as twenty pounds of beef for gravies, and an
entire bottle of Madeira for the soup, the dinner was very elegant and satisfactory.  Lina
would, I fancy, have been much aggrieved, had she known that her artistic dishes were supposed
to have been sent up from Delmonico's.

July 20.

A drive to Tarrytown to-day.  After two months of inland air, the change to the exhilarating
salt breeze blowing up from the Hudson was very refreshing, and made us quite regret, during
the few hours we spent there, that Chappaqua could not be occasionally transported to the seaside.

"I am especially fond," said Ida, "of living by the sea, although I do not enjoy an ocean voyage;
but a cottage at Newport is my ideal home for the summer."

"Newport air," said mamma, "would, I think, be too strong for me.  The most agreeable sea air
that I ever experienced was upon the Isle of Wight.  There the climate was so mild as to be
very beneficial to me. But you must know as much or more than I do about the Isle of Wight
air, for you spent several months there with your mother when last in Europe, did you not?"

"Yes, we spent a winter and spring at Ventnor," said Ida; "that town, you know, is especially
recommended to people with lung troubles, although I could never see that it did poor mamma
much good."

"Did you ever see, Aunt Esther," inquired Gabrielle, "the poem that was addressed to Ida while
she was at Ventnor?"

Mamma had not before heard of it; therefore, upon our return, Ida took it out of her portfolio,
and showed it to us.  It was written by a New York editor and poet, and was, we all thought,
very beautiful and appropriate.  As it was in MSS., Ida allowed me to copy it into my journal.

  A FAMILIAR IDYL.

  FOR IDA LILLIAN GREELEY.

  Dear friend!  If I could step to-day
    Upon your cosey English isle,
    Victoria's chosen home erewhile,
  And hallowed by the Laureate's lay;

  Though beauty breaks from every view,
    And one long splendor edge the shore,
    I should not pause an hour before
  I touched the terrace graced by you.

  For what's a Queen's or Poet's worth?
    The light that lies on land and sea
    Resplendent?  Dearer far to me
  The friendship which outweighs the earth.

  Should I not find you--happy chance--
    Just where your ivied cottage stands,
    Dreaming with hope of western lands,
  Or facing torn and tortured France?

  And you could tell of sunny days?
    Of chalky cliffs and spreading downs;
    Nature is more than bustling towns,
  And country life than city ways.

  But hearing now a robin sing,
    I wonder if his English mate
    May not be hopping near your gate,
  A harbinger, with ours, of Spring.

  I know the precious charge you hold;
    But now, when comes the budding year,
    I wish the rather you were here
  To see our leafy months unfold.

  To watch the coming choir of birds,
    And note the lengthening twilight hours,
    The miracles of buds and flowers,
  And tender shows too sweet for words.

  But you who hear the throstle sing,
    And greet the lark's high ecstasies,
    May learn to care no more for these,
  And spurn each weaker voice and wing.

  I will not think it--home is home;
    And much as other skies may do,
    Ours will not reach its sweetest blue,
  Nor May seem perfect, till you come.

March 1, 1871.

July 25.

"It is some time, auntie," said Gabrielle, from the sofa, "since you have told us any stories.
Now I wish that this evening, while I am working upon my pin-cushion, you would relate some
more episodes of your Pennsylvania life;" and she opened her work box, and took out a little
roll of canvas, upon which she was busy delineating in pale yellow wool a stiff little canary,
with a surprising eye, and an impossible tail.

"I have forgotten what I have already related, dear," replied mamma; "you must tell me where
to take up my story."

"You left off at the manufacture of black salts," said Gabrielle, "and I want you to commence
at that very point, and not forget anything that occurred."

"Perhaps you would like to hear about sugar making," said mamma; "that was one of father's
yearly enterprises, and great sport we young people thought it."

"Oh, do tell us about it," said Gabrielle, with sparkling eyes; "that will be delightful; almost
as good as meeting a bear."

"Although not so exciting, I fear," said mamma, laughing; "I am sorry that I have no encounters
with bears to meet your demands for thrilling adventures to-night; but if, as I suppose, you
have never seen the process of sugar making, you will find an account of it quite interesting."

"Father had upon his extensive acres hundreds of grand old forest maples, which, growing as
they did, in patches in the wilderness, formed what were called in country parlance 'sugar
bushes,' or, in the more elegant language of books, 'sugar orchards.'  Early in the spring,
when the sun stood high, and the snow began to melt, the maples would be 'tapped,' as the farmers
say; sometimes by boring into them, and often by driving in a chisel; then a wooden spout would
be inserted through which the sweet sap would begin to trickle down into the troughs placed
there to receive it.  From these troughs it was collected and carried in buckets and pails
to an immense receptacle hollowed out of the trunk of some great tree; usually selecting what
was called the 'cucumber tree,' as its soft wood could be more easily excavated than that of
other trees.  The men used to wear a yoke upon their shoulders with hooks from which the pails
were suspended; and thus equipped they would traverse to and fro with the sap.  I well remember
lending my assistance to father by trudging valiantly through snow that reached my knees, to
carry buckets of sap, but without the assistance of a yoke.

"The process of making sugar is very like that I described in the manufacture of black salts.
The sap is poured into immense cauldrons, and boils sometimes for several days.  As fast as
it evaporates, fresh sap is poured in until the syrup becomes thick, and then follows granulation,
or, as the farmers call it, 'sugaring off.'  These periods of sugaring off, which occurred
usually once or twice a week during the sugar season, were participated in by the neighbors
from far and near, who would come to eat sugar and make merry.

"I forgot, however, to tell you that while the sap was boiling, some one had to spend the night
in the woods to refill the cauldron, and to keep up the fire.  In our family this duty fell
to brother Barnes, who took much delight in it.  With some boy friend he would camp out upon
a bundle of straw before the fire, and with a nice supper, and songs and stories, diversified
by rising every half hour to stir up the fire, and watch the cauldron, and to have a private
sugaring off for their own benefit, the boys would pass away the night.

"But were they in no danger from wild animals, mamma?" inquired Marguerite.

"Not much," replied mamma; "the boys always took their guns with them, but although the deer
would rustle over the leaves, and bears and wolves would creep softly up to the little encampment,
the fire was usually sufficient protection, and the wolves would content themselves with howling,
and with a dissatisfied grunt the bears would move slowly away.

"Often the boys would see through the darkness a pair of fiery eyes glaring at them, and seizing
their rifles they would shoot; but if they missed aim, the bears or wolves would have been
sufficiently alarmed by the noise to make their escape whilst they could.  Boys accustomed
to a pioneer's life feared nothing; such adventures were as great sport to them in the woods,
as they are to you, Gabrielle, while listening to them safely housed."

"But in novels, and books of travel in new countries, auntie," said Gabrielle with a dissatisfied
shake of her pretty head, "when you fire at a bear or other wild animal and do not kill him,
he instantly turns and kills you.  Were the bears and wolves of Pennsylvania less ferocious
than those of other countries?"

"They did not often seem bloodthirsty," replied mamma, "for the reason, I suppose, that the
woods were full of smaller animals on which they could prey, and consequently they did not
need to attack human beings for sustenance.  I remember, however, one incident that may perhaps
satisfy your desire for more thrilling adventures.

"An old woman living near what was called 'the Carter settlement,' some six miles from us,
started to pay a visit to a friend in the next 'clearing.'  To reach her destination she had
to pass through the densest part of the forest, with no indication of a path to guide her:
but she never thought of danger as she started upon her long, lonely walk.

"Several days elapsed before it was fairly realized that the old lady was missing; and then
the neighbors started en masse through the forest with tin pans, tin horns, and stalwart lungs,
to look for her.  Their shouts met with no response, but after a long search they met a pack
of wolves who fled rapidly past them.  Fairly alarmed now lest the old woman should have perished
from fatigue and exposure, they pursued the search with desperate haste, and not far from the
spot where they had met the wolves, found some scraps of a dress that was recognized as hers,
a few bones, and her feet, which, encased as they were in stout boots, the wolves had disdained
to devour.  Whether the old woman had fallen a live victim to the wolves, or had died of hunger
and fatigue and then furnished a repast to them, we never knew; this latter supposition, however,
seemed hardly probable, for she could have found in the woods wild berries, succulent roots,
and water sufficient to subsist upon for several days."

A shiver of horror went around our little circle, and even Gabrielle's love for the terrible
was satisfied.

After a short pause, Marguerite said:

"You must often have felt lonely, mamma, did you not, living so far away from all places of
amusement, lectures, and the like?  Indeed, I suppose that buried as you were in the woods,
you did not even have the excitement of going to church."

"No," said mamma; "we were dependent for entertainment entirely upon our own resources and
the few books we had brought with us from Vermont; but we children were never conscious of
a lonely hour, and if dear mother felt sad and weary of our uneventful life, we never knew it.

"We worked hard all day, every one of us, even little Margaret having something to do; but
in the evening we had a change of occupation.  At twilight, when father and brother Barnes
had come home, and our early supper was over, father would say:

"'Mary, what have you to read to us to-night?'

"Immediately fresh logs would be piled up in the great open fireplace, the candles lighted,
we girls would draw up to the table with our knitting or sewing, Barnes would throw himself
down before the fire, and mother would take up a book for the evening's reading.  This reading
was as much a part of the routine of the day as dinner or supper, and was indeed our only means
of culture that winter, distant as we were from schools and all other educational advantages.
Mother always monopolized the position of reader; indeed, until after her death, father seldom
read a book, but contented himself with being a listener."

"And was he a good listener, mamma?" I inquired, "or did he stop grandmamma from time to time
to comment upon the author and the events?"

"Father's intentions were the best in the world," replied mamma smiling, "but you must remember
that he would sit down to listen, completely exhausted from a day's work that had commenced
with the first tinge of dawn, and before very long, soothed by mother's musical voice, his
breathing would become more and more audible, and his head commence to nod.  Quite patiently
mother would continue her chapter, feigning not to be conscious of the heavy breathing that
proceeded from the arm-chair, and often from the boyish figure stretched before the fire, until
their slumber would become too apparent, when, closing the book, she would call them severely
to task for their inattention.

"Rubbing his eyes, father would rouse up, and indignantly refuting the accusation, declare
that he had heard every word.

"Instantly putting him to the test, mother would inquire what she had been reading about?

"After a moment of deep reflection, father would say penitently:

"'Well, Mary, if you will just read back a page or two, I will remember all about it.'

"Very indulgently mother would turn back, but often before she had reached the former stopping-place,
father's breathing would announce that he was again resting from the hard day's toil.

"Barnes was somewhat better as a listener, but he, like father, worked hard, and it was often
difficult for him to keep awake during the reading of history or novels; but we three girls
were a most interested audience, and somewhat compensated for masculine inattention.

"But father was not always drowsy; at times he would listen with keen interest to the evening
reading, and very much vexed he would be if the arrival of any neighbor should put a stop to it.

"'My wife is reading something extremely interesting to us,' he would artfully say; 'perhaps
you would like to listen to it also?'

"'By all means,' the unsuspecting visitor would reply, and not another opportunity would he
have to speak until it was time to take leave."

"What books did grandmamma read to you?" inquired Marguerite.  "You have mentioned both history
and novels, but without giving any names."

"Your uncle," replied mamma, "supplied us with light literature from the resources of the Spectator
office--newspapers, pamphlets, periodicals, etc., and mother's own little library was sterling
in its quality as her own old-fashioned ballads; it was quite varied, too, considering how
few volumes it contained.

"One of the books that I remember was Butler's 'History of the United States;' a ponderous
tome that I presume you children have never seen.

"Another volume from which we derived much information and pleasure was a large 'Universal
History;' the name of its author I have forgotten.

"The 'History of the Jews,' by Josephus, was also a great favorite with mother; this work did
not, however, belong to us, but was lent us by your other grandfather, Marguerite.  Mr. Cleveland,
a neighbor of ours, you know, had, like us, a small library of standard books, which he was
always glad to lend to an appreciative reader.

"The 'Wonders of Nature and Providence' was another book that I remember well, and a 'Life
of Napoleon,' by what author I do not know, but which was a source of endless delight both
to father and mother. The emperor, you know, had been dead only since 1821, consequently his
exploits were fresh in every one's memory, and some of mother's most stirring songs were about
'General Bonaparte.'  You four children come legitimately by your devotion to Napoleon, for
both father and mother were enthusiastic in their admiration for the great French hero.

"Among our smaller books was a life of Prince Eugene of Savoy, and the memoirs of Baron Trenck,
whose romantic history we enjoyed as much as the most thrilling novel.

"As for novels, we had not many at that time, although the newspapers with which brother furnished
us usually contained serial stories that mother used to read aloud.  I remember, however, that
mother owned 'Waverley,' 'Rob Roy,' and 'Francis Berrian,' a romance of which father was especially
fond, and all of which she read to us.

"For poetry, we had a volume of selections from English poets, accompanied with brief sketches
of their lives, a volume about two-thirds the size of Dana's 'Household Book of Poetry,' a
copy of Cowper, whose poems mother particularly liked, especially 'The Task'; a small, unbound
copy of Byron's 'Corsair,' and a volume of English songs, a collection that I have never since
seen.  This list refers, you know, to our first years in the woods, and everything that I have
mentioned was read aloud to us by mother.

"On Sundays we had a change of literature.  Father, although not what would be called a religious
man, as he was not a member of any church, had a great respect for the observance of the Sabbath,
and unlike his less scrupulous neighbors, rested from work on that day.  The morning was devoted
to reading the Bible, and in the evening father would sing with his splendid voice, 'God of
Israel,' the 'Rock of Ages,' and other fine old psalm tunes.  One hymn of which he was especially
fond, I remember commenced,

  "'The day is past and gone,
    The evening shades appear;
  Oh, may we all remember well
    The day of Death draws near.'

"This he used to sing with great expression of devotion.

"I have often wished that I had had the advantage of living in New York when a child, but I
would not now exchange a city education for the sweet memory of our quiet evenings at home,
and the sphere of intelligence and affection in which I was nurtured."

Mamma paused a moment, then continued:

"These books that I have mentioned were not new to mother: she had read and knew them almost
by heart long before she commenced reading them to us, and her mind was an inexhaustible source
of knowledge.  Although her school-days were limited, she was not ignorant of the common branches.
She had studied, she told me, the 'Ladies' Lexicon,' from which she had obtained a very thorough
knowledge of English grammar. She wrote a trim hand, she had a practical knowledge of arithmetic,
and geography had claimed a portion of her time in school; but what she had learnt there was
but a commencement.  She must subsequently have studied astronomy, for she taught me without
books to recognize the planets and trace the constellations, and at any hour of the night she
could tell the time by looking at the position of the stars.  She had the talent for dates
that you have inherited, Marguerite, and was authority for the neighborhood upon all disputed
points in politics since the days of Washington; indeed, it was quite amusing to see the men
all come to consult 'Aunt Mary' rather than father, when a knotty question arose."

"As you have described grandmamma," said Marguerite, "she appears to be superior to grandpapa.
Do you so consider her?"

"Mother was father's superior," replied mamma, "intellectually and morally.  Father was rather
cold in his nature, but mother had a warm heart.  She was an enthusiastic friend, and she loved
every living thing.  I do not remember ever hearing her speak an ill word of a neighbor, and
I am sure she never had an enemy in her life.

"Though I do not call father warm-hearted, he certainly had great affection for mother, and
was sincerely attached to his family.  I have heard him say that he would walk all night, rather
than stop short of his home.

"Father was sometimes called by our neighbors a hard parent.  He never was, it is true, demonstrative
in his affection, but he was strictly just, and never harsh in his treatment of us.  As I have
often told you, he believed in work for himself and his family, and I have heard him say that
sooner than have a child of his grow up idle, he would make him pick up stones in one lot,
and throw them over into the next one.  He considered that he had been generous in allowing
brother Horace to leave home, or, as country people call it, 'giving him his time,' six years
before he became of age, and he was willing at any time to allow his daughters to seek their
fortunes away from home, should they desire to do so.

"This winter of 1826-27 was the last one that we four children spent at home together.  The
next year sister Arminda, although only twelve years old, opened a school in the little log-house
upon our west farm--"

"When only twelve years old!" we interrupted in chorus; "pray whom did she teach?  Babies?"

"No," replied mamma, "she had a dozen or fourteen pupils, little boys and girls, some of whom
were older than herself, for very young children could not have walked that distance--three
and four miles."

"But I should think," interposed Gabrielle, "that the scholars would have felt more inclined
to play with Aunt Arminda, than to learn the lessons she gave them; she was such a child."

"Your aunt was tall and well-developed," replied mamma, "and had a natural air of dignity that
gave her the appearance of being older than she really was.  She did not find it difficult
to impress her pupils with respect, or to enforce obedience."

"What did she teach them, Aunt Esther?" inquired Ida; "only the elementary branches, I suppose?"

"Reading, writing, and spelling," replied mamma; "arithmetic and grammar, geography, sewing
and knitting."

"And how much did she make?" I inquired, being of a practical turn of mind at that moment.

"She was paid by the week," said mamma, "and received the same salary as the majority of school-mistresses
in those primeval days; seventy-five cents and her board.  She 'boarded around,' as the phrase
was, among her pupils.  This may seem very little to you, but you must remember that in those
days a good milch cow cost only ten dollars, and everything else was proportionately cheap.

"The next two winters, sister Arminda was in school herself, and the following year, when she
was fifteen, she was married to our handsome cousin Lovel, Uncle Benjamin's son."

Another exclamation of amazement from the little group, and a chorus of--

"Married at fifteen!  How surprising!  And did she make a pretty bride?"

"She was a very handsome girl," replied mamma, and made a striking contrast to her blonde brothers
and sisters, for she had a rich brunette complexion, large, dark-blue eyes, glossy dark hair,
and set roses in her cheeks, which, even now that she is a great-grandmother have not entirely
faded.  She was womanly far beyond her years; not so romantic, perhaps, as sister Margaret
and I were at her age, but that she possessed talent, enterprise, and ambition, is shown by
the success of her school, established at an age when most girls are contentedly dressing their
dolls.

"Sister Arminda is a woman of superior character, and a devoted wife and mother.  She has had
many severe trials to contend with during her long married life.  Her heart has known bitter
sorrow, for of her family of eleven beautiful children only four are now living; but she has
borne all these afflictions with enduring heroism.  The devotion of herself and her husband
is something people of the world would consider quite Arcadian in these days of matrimonial
infelicity, for until your Aunt Arminda paid me that visit three years ago, she had never,
since her marriage, left her husband two successive nights."

August 4.

A gap in my journal of several days, during which time I have found it impossible to write.
I have now several events to record.

Papa came out Saturday afternoon to make us his weekly visit, accompanied by Mr. Reid.

Papa's "young chief" looked as well as though he had not the weight of the new nine-story Tribune
building upon his shoulders this hot weather, and was exceedingly agreeable.  Those who have
only known Mr. Reid in New York salons and in editorial rooms can have no idea what a different
man he is when enjoying the relaxation of the country.  Never could I have imagined that the
haughty young proprietor of The Tribune would condescend to participate in "ring toss," croquet,
and similar frivolities; but I have found this summer that, besides being an adept in the masculine
accomplishments of driving and riding, he is an enthusiastic champion of croquet, taking apparently
the same pleasure in sending an adversary's ball to the extreme limits of the croquet-ground
that he would in refuting a Times editorial.

The evening was devoted to cards and ballad-singing, for, although so prominent a member of
New York literary society, Mr. Reid does not, I am glad to say, think it necessary to dislike
music.

For the next day an expedition to Croton Lake had been planned.  When alone, we never drive
on Sunday, except to church, lest our sober Puritan neighbors should be shocked; but as we
had a guest for that day, we made an exception to our usual severe rules; for a Sunday in Chappaqua
is somewhat gloomy to a visitor.  Immediately after breakfast, therefore, the carriage came,
and Ida and I, with papa and Mr. Reid, started on this pleasant little excursion, papa mischievously
suggesting that we should look pious, and the neighbors would never know that we were not going
to church.

One little contretemps marked our departure.  The Duchess had been lame for a day or two, and
another horse had been hired for the day to replace her.  The strange horse was evidently the
property of a Quaker, and more accustomed to going to meeting than on frivolous pleasure parties,
for she was a very staid and subdued animal, and strongly disinclined to keep up with the lively
pace adopted by spirited little Lady Alice.  The drive, therefore, was decidedly an interesting
one.  Papa held the reins, and Mr. Reid devoted himself to whipping up the laggard beast. 
In this style we proceeded over the country at a moderate pace, and finally reached the beautiful
lake and the hotel upon its banks.  The shade of the broad piazza formed a very pleasant relief
from the heat overhead, and we were glad to rest a little while.  We had not been there many
minutes before some one recognized Mr. Reid, and informed the portly landlord, who immediately
hastened upon the scene, and welcomed him to Croton Lake with enthusiasm.

In the parlor the piano was open, and half a dozen children were drumming upon it; therefore,
seeing that "music" on Sundays was not prohibited by the rules of the house, I went to the
piano when the children wearied of it, and sung, at Ida's request, an Ave Maria, and grandpapa's
favorite "Rock of Ages."  We had some little amusement over the necessity of going four miles
from home in order to enjoy music on Sundays.

The water looked very inviting, rippling up to the beach, and a row to Croton Dam was proposed.
After some little delay, a boat and a very good-natured negro boatman were procured, and we
departed.

The sun, I must own, was rather hot at that hour of the day, and struck with peculiar force
upon our hot bombazine dresses, and heavy crape veils.  Ida and I looked with a sigh at Mr.
Reid's cool white flannel suit.  Sam, the boatman, ceased to row, and let the boat drift, being
overcome by the heat, while papa sat in the bow, and looked disconsolate that he had not the
morning news to read.

We were now at quite a distance from the shore, and as there was no one present but the boatman
to be shocked by hearing secular music, I ventured to sing a few simple ballads, for music
and water I think blend most harmoniously.

Soon light, fleecy clouds commenced to shield us from the sun's scorching rays; we closed our
parasols, and played with the deliciously cool water, wondering meantime like Miss Helen, in
that exquisite "Atlantic" story, if we could call up a mermaid front below.  But while we were
drifting along so charmingly, the clouds had become heavier and blacker, and seizing the oars,
Sam commenced to row with desperate haste.  We were, however, beaten in our race with the storm,
and reached Croton Dam in a perfect tempest of thunder, and lightning, and dashing rain. Unfortunately
Ida and I had worn slippers, not having expected to walk, and there was only one umbrella in
the party--our little parasols with their crape borders and bows being more suitable for ornament
than service; however, we scrambled up the steep bank as best we could, and ran to the protecting
doorway of the water-house (the house itself was locked as it was Sunday).  Here we stowed
ourselves away like so many sardines, and waited patiently under the umbrella for an hour.
Finally the sun broke out, and we made our way over deep ponds of water back to our boat. 
Sam looked up with a dejected expression as we approached, and feared the boat wasn't fit for
the ladies to go home in; he was bailing it out as fast as he could, but it was very wet.

Wet indeed!  Why Sam had not drawn the boat up on the beach and turned it over during the rain,
no one could imagine; but that brilliant idea had not occurred to him.  Therefore we were obliged
to row back with our feet reposing in little pools of water.

Before long, down came the rain again in torrents, but stimulated by the prospective fee, Sam
rowed with giant strokes.  About a mile from the hotel, we met the landlord rowing with desperate
haste.  It seems that the rain had been even more violent at his end of the lake, having been
magnified into a squall upon the water, and a tornado upon land, blowing down trees, and breaking
away the lattice-work of the hotel piazza; consequently he supposed our boat must have been
ingulfed, and had come to look for the corpses.  His amazement at finding us alive, and, though
very wet, in excellent spirits, was great.

An entrée into the hotel in our wet dresses was rather a formidable affair for Ida and myself,
as all the boarders were assembled upon the piazza to see, I suppose, how we looked after our
"miraculous escape from drowning."  Hastening past them into a private room, we took off our
dripping wraps, and supplied their places with brilliant plaid shawls lent us by the landlady,
in which we drove back to Chappaqua--to the wonder, I doubt not, of all who recognized us on
the way.  The horses this time went more evenly, and the entire strain of propelling the carriage
did not fall upon poor Lady Alice.  But when we reached home, Mr. Reid's white suit, and our
dresses, veils, and even faces, were a sight to behold from the liquid mud with which we were
bespattered.  We had to turn out of our way for a couple of miles, as a tree blown down by
the storm lay across the main road, and this second detention did not increase the enthusiasm
of our welcome from Lina, for dinner had been ordered at half-past three, and it was five when
we reached the house. Her pet dessert, a lemon soufflée, intended to be eaten as soon as baked,
was not, I must own, improved by standing so long; but otherwise no serious damage was done
to the dinner, and we were thankful that our adventures when indulging in pleasure parties
on Sunday were over.

The evening passed quietly, but very agreeably.  Mr. Reid went down to the city in the six
o'clock train, and papa read aloud to us Byron's splendid, stirring "Isles of Greece," and
portions of "Childe Harold." Reading poetry is quite an accomplishment of papa's, and although
he is very happy in sentimental and heroic verse, he has also a keen sense of humor, and his
reading of comic and dialect poems, especially those of Hans Breitmann, have been much complimented;
indeed, in "our circle" he is the reader par excellence of Bret Harte, John Hay, and Hans Breitmann.

August 7.

Marguerite and Ida went down yesterday to the city for a day's shopping, a relaxation of which
we are all quite fond.  I walked down to the station to meet them upon their return, and was
not a little surprised to see a third black-robed figure emerge from the cars with them.  Too
petite to be Gabrielle, who has been visiting a school-friend for the last week, it was not
until the second glance that I recognized the abundant golden-brown hair and romantic eyes
of our pretty cousin, Theresa Walling.

Theresa is Aunt Arminda's granddaughter, and although only eighteen, is entitled to pass through
a door in advance of Marguerite, Ida and I, and to occupy the back seat in a carriage, for
she is married, and has had two sweet little girls, one of whom died during that sad month
of November, last year, and the oldest, her pretty Theresa Beatrice, only a week ago.  Quite
delicate from her childhood, the loss of her babies has been a great affliction to their poor
little mother, and Ida brought her out to visit us, hoping that change of scene might bring
back the former rose-flush to her pale cheeks.

Early marriages appear hereditary in that branch of the family, for Aunt Arminda was married
at fifteen, and Theresa's mother at fourteen; consequently, Aunt Arminda found herself a great-grandmother
when some years short of sixty.

I said that Theresa lost her youngest child within the thirty days that elapsed between uncle's
and Aunt Mary's deaths; but those were not the only bereavements in our family that sad winter;
before the spring came, Theresa's father and a little girl, our cousin Victoria's child, had
also died.

Theresa's beauty is not the true Greeley type--blonde, with blue eyes. Her complexion is somewhat
like her grandmother's--a delicate olive with an exquisite flush, when in health.  The contour
of her face is a perfect oval; her eyes are dark and pensive, and although her hair is almost
golden in its brightness, both her eyebrows and lashes are of a dark chestnut brown.  In figure
she is, as I said, very petite; she and I are the two "little ones" of the family.

Theresa displays considerable taste for literature; and, notwithstanding the demand that her
children made upon her time, has written some romantic stories that have been published in
New York journals.

She has a bright little brother, and three sisters--Fannie, Jessie, and Lillian; all pretty
and clever children.  Fannie, who is now only fourteen, will, I hope, when older, become a
graceful poetess; for the verses that she has already had published under her pretty signature,
"Fannie Fawn," are very musical, and promise well for the future.

August 9.

"Mamma," said Marguerite, looking up from the tea-table where we were all assembled, "did uncle
visit you often in Pennsylvania?  I suppose so, for I know what an affectionate family you
wore, and how very fond he was of his parents."

"He visited us as often as he could," replied mamma, "but you know that the distance was great,
and during the four years that he spent in Poultney, his time was not at his command.  I can
only remember two visits that he made us during that period; each one, however, lasted a month.

"It was, I think, during our second year in the woods that he came home for the first time.
I well remember, after the first joy of the reunion was over, examining his trunk to see what
books he had brought with him.  Those that I found there were quite different from what many
boys of seventeen would have chosen, when going home for a vacation.  I do not recollect meeting
any books of adventure or romance; but works upon the higher mathematics and philosophy were
there to show that dear brother's education was by no means at a standstill, although he was
working hard to earn his own living.

"During the evenings, he would gather us about him, and illustrate some mathematical problem,
or, giving us a dissertation upon natural science, would expound the laws of gravitation, etc.

"In the daytime, when not fishing or bee hunting, he would work in the fields with father and
brother Barnes.  There was excellent trout fishing, I remember, in the brooks; and that, with
bee hunting and watching the forest fires, was his only amusement; for shooting was a pastime
in which he never indulged."

"I thought," said Marguerite, "that boys in the country were always fond of shooting."

"As a rule they are," replied mamma; "but your uncle was not.  His delicate, sensitive nature
was always shocked by the sharp report of a gun.  I remember that when we were in Vermont he
and brother Barnes would go out together to hunt squirrels, Barnes carrying the gun; and that
when the game was found, brother Horace would cover his ears with his hands, to soften the
noise of the discharge.

"I suppose, my dears, that you do not know how hunters find wild honey?"

We knew little of wild honey save that John the Baptist used to eat it, so mamma continued:

"The bees, having no hives provided for them, made their honey in the hollow trunks of trees;
and as it was one of the luxuries of our table, it was quite important to trace out their hiding-places.
Brother Barnes would go out with a little box of syrup or honey, and when he found a bee upon
a flower would imprison it in the box, detaining it there until it had had time to load itself
with sweetness.  When it was released, it would make a 'bee line' for its home in the tree;
never pausing by the way, even for the sweetest flowers.  Barnes would note the direction it
had taken, and follow it as well as he could; but often he would be obliged to capture several
bees, and sometimes pass days in the pursuit, before he would be rewarded by hearing in some
tree a buzzing that could almost be called roaring.  The next step was to fell the tree, which
would cause the bees to quickly disperse; not, however, without stinging the intruder; but
the result compensated for a sting or two, for it was not unusual for Barnes to find from twenty
to thirty pounds in a tree, often, however, so mixed with the soft wood that we were obliged
to strain it before it was fit to put upon the table."

"You spoke of the forest fires, mamma," said Marguerite; "pray, what were they?  The woods
were never literally on fire, I suppose."

"Oh yes," replied mamma, "and the fire often lasted a long time.  One means of clearing the
ground to make a farm was to fell the trees, while in full leafage, in what were called 'winrows.'
They lay in great piles for a year and sometimes longer; then when quite dry they would be
ignited, and a glorious bonfire on a gigantic scale would ensue.  The fire would burn up not
only all the logs and dead leaves upon the ground, but, spreading its way through the forest,
would do considerable damage to the living trees, burning as it often did for weeks.  It was,
however, a grand sight to watch it through the darkness of the night, and when the fire running
up the hollow trunk of some dead tree would burst out in a blaze at the top, we children were
filled with enthusiasm, and used to call them 'our beacon lights.' Never did brother Horace
seem happier than during that fiery season, and often he and brother Barnes spent the greater
portion of the night among the burning log-piles, stirring up the fires when they smouldered,
and throwing on brush and fresh logs.

"During the year that he worked at his trade upon the shores of Lake Erie, we saw him more
frequently; but the visit that I remember with the greatest pleasure was one that he made us
just after establishing his New Yorker.  I was much impressed during this last visit with a
marked change in brother's taste and character--a change indicated as much by his reading as
by his external appearance.  His trunk was now filled with standard works and volumes of poems,
instead of treatises upon science, and he appeared in a perpetual rose-dream.  He seemed to
me the embodiment of romance and poesy, and now as I think of him with his pure, unselfish
nature, so early devoted to what was noblest and best, I can only compare him to the high-minded
boy-saint, the chaste, seraphic Aloysius.

"It was while at home this time that he wrote his poem 'The Faded Stars,' that was published
in the New Yorker, and copied into several leading journals--"

"Oh, I am so fond of that poem," interrupted Ida, "that I have copied it into my album of poetical
selections.  Papa wrote it, you say, while visiting you?"

"Yes, he wrote it in the room where the family were all assembled.  I recollect sitting beside
him and watching his face as line after line flowed from his pen.  I had never before seen
any one write a poem, and it seemed to me quite wonderful.  Read it to me, Ida, if your album
is at hand; I do not recollect all the stanzas."

"THE FADED STARS."

BY HORACE GREELEY.

  I

  "I mind the time when Heaven's high dome
    Woke in my soul a wondrous thrill--
  When every leaf in Nature's tome
    Bespoke Creation's marvels still;
  When morn unclosed her rosy bars,
    Woke joys intense; but naught e'er bade
  My soul leap up like ye bright stars!
    [1]

  II.

  "Calm ministrants to God's high glory!
    Pure gems around His burning throne!
  Mute watchers o'er man's strange, sad story
    Of crime and woe through ages gone!
  'Twas yours, the wild and hallowing spell,
    That lured me from ignoble glens--
  Taught me where sweeter fountains
    Than ever bless the worldling's dreams.

  III.

  "How changed was life!  A waste no more
    Beset by Pain, and Want, and Wrong,
  Earth seemed a glad and fairy shore,
    Made vocal with Hope's impassioned song.
  But ye bright sentinels of Heaven!
    Far glories of Night's radiant sky!
  Who when ye lit the brow of Even
    Has ever deemed man born to die?

  IV.

  "'Tis faded now!  That wondrous grace
    That once on Heaven's forehead shone:
  I see no more in Nature's face
    A soul responsive to mine own.
  A dimness on my eye and spirit
    Has fallen since those gladsome years,
  Few joys my hardier years inherit,
    And leaden dulness rules the spheres.

  V.

  "Yet mourn not I!  A stern high duty
    Now nerves my arm and fires my brain.
  Perish the dream of shapes of Beauty!
    And that this strife be not in vain
  To war on fraud intrenched with power,
    On smooth pretence and specious wrong,
  This task be mine tho' Fortune lower--
    For this be banished sky and song."

"How did it happen, mamma," inquired Marguerite, "that Uncle Barnes has not become a distinguished
man?  Is he not clever like Uncle Horace, or was he not fond of learning?  It seems strange
that he never left home to seek his fortune in the world."

"Brother Barnes has quite as much genius," mamma quickly replied, "as your Uncle Horace, and
under equally favoring circumstances would have made as brilliant a man.  A farmer's life was
distasteful to him, and it was for years his dream to go away from home, and receive an education
that would fit him for the bar or the pulpit, towards both of which 'callings' he was strongly
attracted.  It would, however, have been impossible for father to have hewn a farm unaided
out of the wilderness, and he could not afford to hire any assistance, so brother Barnes generously
sacrificed all his own aspirations and preferences, and devoted his life, which might have
been a brilliant and successful one, to the dull routine of farm acres."

"Did Uncle Barnes resemble papa much, as a boy?" inquired Ida.

"Your uncle was of a very different temperament," replied mamma; "he was as gay and loquacious
as your papa was silent and abstracted.  He was very fond of reading and of study, but he lacked
your papa's perseverance; he was more awake to the outer world and its distractions, whereas
brother Horace was oblivious to everything else, when he once held a book in his hand.

"I have told you what a splendid voice your grandfather had.  Brother Barnes was the only one
of the five children who inherited it, and with it a very quick ear for music.  I remember
hearing mother say, that when he was three and four years old, he was often called upon to
sing for our friends, who not unfrequently rewarded his talent with presents; however, at the
time when his voice changed, it completely lost its musical qualities, to our great regret.

"As he grew older, he developed a taste for argument, that would have done him good service
had he been able to follow out his darling project of becoming a lawyer; indeed, as it was,
he was always called upon, unprofessionally, to settle the neighbors' disputes, and was renowned
for making all the love-matches of the neighborhood.  In his reading he had rather a peculiar
taste; he delighted in theological and controversial books, and I never knew any one who was
more thoroughly acquainted with the Bible.  He could not only give the precise chapter and
verse from which any text was taken, but was able to detect the slightest verbal error in the
quotation.

"He had a passion for preaching, and although unordained, was always ready to deliver a sermon
whenever he could find a vacant church and an audience.

"Every one in America has heard of your papa's benevolent disposition, and the amount he used
to spend in private charities.  Your Uncle Barnes was, if possible, more generous.  I have
known him to part with his last dollar to relieve another from want or embarrassment, and this
was not done through weakness or inability to refuse, but from a genuine impulse of sympathy
with those in need.

"I am very proud to say of my only surviving brother, that although he has never had the advantage
of a good education, he has lived to the age of sixty without indulging in tobacco, wine, or
profane language, and has brought up his boys in the same temperate habits."

"How many children has Uncle Barnes, Aunt Esther?" inquired Ida.  "I have, I think, seen only
three."

"There are ten living," replied mamma.  "Brother Barnes, you know, has been twice married.
His first wife was a woman of fine character, but became, soon after her marriage, a confirmed
invalid, and brother Barnes' constant attention and care of her during her years of illness
was almost unparalleled for devotion.

"Victoria is the oldest of the children: she was a very bright, clever little girl, and a great
pet with mother, as she was the first grandchild born at home.  Sister Arminda's children,
living at some distance, were not so available for instruction, and in that occupation consisted
mother's happiness.  She taught Victoria to read when she was two years and a half old, and
I remember seeing her stand, a few years later, at mother's knee, reading one of Hans Christian
Andersen's stories, with the tears streaming down her cheeks at the pathos--a proof of appreciation
that delighted mother's heart.

"Victoria is married, and lives in Kansas.  She is a fine, intelligent woman, and since the
loss of her little girl, last winter, has shown a strong disposition to write.  She has the
ability to do so, and if her health and her home duties permit, I am sure she will make a clever
writer.

"Horace, whom you have seen, is next Victoria in age; he is also married, and lives in New Jersey.

"Two married daughters, Mary and Esther, follow.  Mary's mind resembles mother's in her grasp
for politics and history, but she inherits her own mother's feeble health, which unfits her
for giving expression to her masculine intellect.  Esther, who was named for me, is a sweet
and lovely woman, and a devoted wife and mother.

"Poor Woodburn came next on the list--a sensitive, silent youth, more resembling his Uncle
Horace than any of the other children.  You all recollect his sad death three years ago.

"Oscar and Clarence are the youngest of Sally's, the first wife's, children.  Clarence is the
cleverest of the family among the boys.  He is very well educated, and now supports himself
as a land surveyor, although not yet twenty years old."

"Where does he live, Aunt Esther?" inquired Gabrielle, "With his father?"

"No; in Kansas with Victoria," was the reply.  "I must not forget to tell you that he taught
school in Indiana when only sixteen years old, and received a diploma from the State.  His
half-sister, Eugenia, who is only fourteen, has had very pretty verses published in different
New York journals."

"Did Aunt Margaret receive as good an education as you did, when a young girl, mamma?" inquired
Marguerite.  "I remember hearing you say that you were sent away to school for two or three years."

"No," replied mamma, "her advantages for learning were not so good as mine; indeed, I was her
principal teacher.  As I have told you, I went to school very little as a child, and the village
school at Vermont gave only the most meagre and elementary instruction, but I was always an
eager reader of whatever came in my way, as well as an attentive listener, and thus I contrived
while in the woods to pick up considerable information.  I remember seeing at that time in
a neighbor's house, a little, cheaply bound volume, 'Blair's Rhetoric,' which so interested
me that I offered to take care of the owner's baby for two weeks, if she would give me the
book.  A bargain was accordingly made; I 'tended baby' for fifteen days, and received in exchange
the precious volume, which I studied until I learnt it by heart.

"Then I saved pennies until I had collected a sufficient number to send to Erie and purchase
a copy of Comstock's Natural Philosophy--the first one by the way that had ever been brought
into our township--and these two books, together with my self-acquired knowledge, and my own
experience of two years as a teacher, sufficed to fit me to enter the Fredonia Academy, and
to compete fairly with the other girls whose instruction had not been so dearly bought.

"I spent four of the happiest years of my life in school at Fredonia, and only regretted that
sister Margaret could not have shared my advantages.

"Meantime, Margaret commenced to teach school at the age of fifteen, and continued to do so,
until she was married, when twenty years old, giving great satisfaction to every one.  She
has, you know, three children.  Her two boys, Eugene and Arthur, are promising young men, and
are both employed in The Tribune office.  Arthur is married, and has several children.  We
all know how pretty his sister Evangeline is; she, you know, is to become Mrs. Dr. Ross this
winter."

August 14.

Our little household has been unusually quiet for the past week, owing to the absence of the
two lively members of the family, Marguerite and Gabrielle, who are visiting friends by the
seaside and upon the shores of Seneca Lake.  Their absence makes a great change in the ways
of the household, for Ida and I have not the high spirits and constant flow of words that distinguish
our sisters, and we spend our time as quietly and busily as two little nuns, not even dreaming
of asking any one to come up from the city and pass Saturday with us.  We miss them very much,
especially at the table, and in the half hour after tea, when we always gather about mamma's
sofa for a little chat, before separating for our evening's work--writing, practising, or whatever
it may be.

Ida and I usually form the audience upon these occasions, and listen with great interest to
Marguerite's entertaining stories of adventures at home and abroad, or Gabrielle's droll mimicry
of the strongly marked characteristics of some one she has met or dreamed of.  Sometimes the
candles are extinguished, and a ghost story is told, for Gabrielle is fond of the supernatural,
and her dramatic style of narration adds much to our enjoyment; indeed, chancing the other
day to read in a magazine one of her pet stories, I was astonished to find how tame it sounded.

Ida and I find, however, some compensation for our sisters' absence in their sprightly letters,
which arrive while we are at the tea-table. Marguerite writes every day, and her letters are
inimitable in their humor and esprit, for she writes exactly as she talks.  She is visiting
some friends whose acquaintance we made in Paris, and who have a beautiful country-seat upon
Long Island.  Her letters are filled with accounts of drives, fishing-parties, and excursions
in yachts and row-boats, and, lastly, of meeting a real gypsy encampment (not the time-honored
one in "Trovatore") and having her fortune told.

A gypsy woman, it seems, stopped the carriage as Marguerite was driving past, and expressed
so strong a desire to "unveil the future for the young lady," that Marguerite consented, and
held out her hand.  Quite scornfully the gypsy said that her own palm must first be crossed
with money.  Marguerite accordingly gave her a dollar bill, thinking that would be the full
value of any fortune she would receive from a wandering gypsy, but the money was indignantly
returned--the oracle did not tell one-dollar fortunes.

Somewhat astonished at so extensive a demand upon her purse, Marguerite gave her another dollar,
whereupon the gypsy at once declared that the young lady had a lucky face, and would never
want for anything during her life.  The usual dark and fair gentlemen figured largely in her
fortune, and--with a glance at Marguerite's blonde complexion--she was to beware the treachery
of a brunette rival; however, she was destined to triumph in the end, and would indeed succeed
in all her undertakings.  I am sure the gypsy could have promised no less, considering the
high price she placed upon her predictions.

Gabrielle's experience is very different.  She is visiting a former schoolmate, a young girl
of her own age.  Bessie is now a pupil of Vassar College, and enthusiastic over her studies:
consequently the amusements of the two girls are of a very sedate nature: in Gabrielle's words,
"A hermit in his cell, my dear Cecilia, never had a more quiet life than I at present enjoy."

She and Bessie had commenced, Gabrielle told me, to write a story together.  The débût was
most brilliant, and for a time they worked very harmoniously, but unluckily the two little
authoresses had different views respecting the proposal (not drawn from life, I imagine, considering
their years), and in Gabrielle's letter of yesterday no mention was made of the progress of
the story.

The letter, which was very vivacious, was chiefly devoted to the girls' exploits while taking
a buggy drive.  Gabrielle, who is so fearless with her own ponies, quite scorned the lamb-like
animal that was sent up from the livery stable, but she appears to have had much diversion,
nevertheless, to judge from her letter.  She says:

"Yesterday I tried to break the monotony of life at Seneca Lake by hiring a buggy and horse
for Bessie and me to drive.  You should have heard the shriek of horror that rent the air at
the approach of the peaceful old nag.  Miss Carpenter exclaimed:

"'Oh mercy, he points his ears!'

"Poor beast, his ears were pointed by nature, and he could not help it.  Mrs. Brown burst forth
to the astonished stableman:

"'Does he kick, roll, rear, bite, or shy?  Tell me quick, for I know he must do some of them.'

"We did have our drive though, and an adventure too, for we were caught in the rain, and entered
a barn where a handsome young man acted the part of host, and generously bestowed hay upon
our horse."

August 16.

A telegram last night from Marguerite, saying, "Will come on the early train with the Honorable
Francis"--a very pleasant surprise, for, knowing the habits of that gentleman, we had supposed
him to be, if not at the Antipodes, at least in Europe; accordingly, we went down to meet the
train in quite a flutter of excitement.

Mr. Colton is "honorable" from having represented his government for four years at Venice.
In appearance he is tall and swarthy, with a foreign and picturesque cast of features not unlike
the Italian type: a "lovely brigand" we sometimes call him.  Notwithstanding his easy and somewhat
nonchalant air, he is a true American in his active and restless disposition and his love for
travelling.  I would be afraid to state the number of miles he has travelled since we made
his acquaintance in Paris four years ago, and I have known him to start at forty-eight hours'
notice to make a tour of the world.

Mr. Colton made us a visit of two days, and was sufficiently enthusiastic over dear Chappaqua
to satisfy even our exacting demands.

We had some sport over the probable speculations of the telegraph operators concerning our
visitor.  Out of mischief, Marguerite had mentioned him in her telegram merely as "the Honorable
Francis;" for so deep an interest is taken in the messages we receive and send, that we enjoy
puzzling the operators a little; indeed, we may say that our telegrams are common property
here, for seldom do we receive them until they have been carefully read by the telegraph and
railroad officials, and then handed to any interested outsider who may chance to be in the
office.  I will give a little scene that occurred not long ago, by way of illustration.

Our friend Mr. A---- alights from the morning train, and is welcomed by a friend of his who
is stopping for a week or so in Chappaqua.

"Delighted to see you, A----.  Knew you were coming up this morning, so thought I would run
down to the train and meet you."

"How in the world did you know I was coming, my dear fellow?" inquires the astonished A----.
"You don't know Mrs. Cleveland or her niece, do you?"

"No, I don't know them," is the prompt reply, "but I was in the telegraph office yesterday,
and saw your acceptance when it arrived."

TABLEAU.

August 19.

I am not partial to Friday, as it is often an unlucky day for me--a superstition that has come
down to me from grandmamma; but, although I try to think it absurd, our experience of yesterday
proved a singular confirmation.

Ida and I had thought to celebrate the return of Marguerite and Gabrielle by inviting several
friends from the city to enjoy the delicious moonlight with us.  Mamma accordingly wrote the
invitations, and we at once commenced our preparations.  The fête we decided should last three
days, and was to commence Friday afternoon--ominous day!  We were to have moonlight walks and
drives; we were to kindle a fire of pine cones and charcoal upon the beach at Rye Lake, and
boil the kettle and make tea; a boat was to be placed upon our own little pond, and a tent
pitched near by; and, last and most brilliant, Ida's lovely Southern friend, Miss Worthington,
and Gabrielle, were to occupy the tent, dressed as gypsies, and tell the fortunes of the company.

We could scarcely wait for Friday to arrive, but there were many preparations to be made, so
we curbed our impatience and worked very industriously.  As we were now seven in the household,
not counting the servants, and had invited quite a number of guests, the resources of our house
were not extensive enough to stow them all away, consequently we spent a lively morning at
the side-hill house fitting up three rooms, with Minna's assistance.

The blue room, with its pretty outlook upon the meadows, was our favorite, and upon it we bestowed
the most attention.  The carpet was gray and blue, of an especially pretty pattern, and the
handsome marble-topped bureau, exhumed from the never-failing resources of the house in the
woods, looked as fresh as though purchased yesterday.  We made the bed with our own hands,
touching with reverent care the superb blankets with their inscription:

"To Horace Greeley, the Protector of American Industry."

Then, when the blue silk eider-down counterpane was adjusted to our satisfaction, and one or
two little ornaments added to the bureau and chimney-piece--"Cupid" in the Naples Gallery,
and my dear Lela's portrait, both framed in blue velvet, and a beautiful Sèvres vase which
mamma calls "the one that Pickie didn't break" (his little hands destroyed its mate)--we congratulated
ourselves upon the effect of the room.

Apropos of the Cupid, Ida sent it last winter with Annibal Caracci's "Magdalen" and one or
two other religious pictures to be framed at Schaus'.  When they were sent home, to our surprise,
the frames were all surmounted by crosses--an emblem that, although quite en règle for the
Holy Magdalen, was, we thought, singularly inappropriate for Cupid.  Stopping in at Schaus'
a day or two later, I inquired of young Mr. Schaus, to whose taste we had left the selection
of the frames, his reason for this extraordinary innovation.  His reply was as naïve as unexpected:

"But, mademoiselle, does Cupid, then, never meet with crosses?"

Having done our best for the blue room, we walked over the grounds to see that they were all
in order, and when we had admired the pretty blue boat, the white tent, and the water-lilies
in full bloom (planted that morning), and gone down to the express office to receive a package
due by the ten o'clock train--a copy of the poems of one of the expected guests, which was
to be left carelessly in his room with a mark at one of the ballads,--we congratulated ourselves
that we had done all in our power to make the rooms look tasteful and pretty.

Lina was in her glory, having had an unrestricted order to do her best. I had a slight foreboding
of disappointment, as it was Friday, remembering, too, that the dining-room was lighted by
three candles the previous night (a French superstition); but we all dressed in good spirits.

The somewhat spectral appearance of five ladies in mourning was somewhat relieved by the recent
addition to our little circle, Miss Worthington, whose dress, though black, was enlivened by
a little dash of pale blue--a most becoming match for her fair complexion and golden curls.

We did not wish to ruffle our hair unnecessarily by playing croquet or walking, so we all sat
very sedately in the music-room watching for the 5.15 train to arrive.  It came at last.  We
rushed out on the piazza, but recognized no one among the few passengers who alighted.

Disappointment number one.  However, they will surely come at half-past six, we argued, and
taking up some books and work, we waited patiently until the next train arrived.  Again we
ran out upon the piazza.  Papa was upon the platform at the depot, but we saw no other figure
that looked familiar.

"What did I tell you, Ida," said I solemnly, "when, against my entreaties, three candles were
lighted last night?"

Never before was papa so long in walking up from the station--I suppose for the reason that
he came laden with messages, notes, and telegrams. His "young chief" was detained in the editorial
rooms by affairs of great moment; another gentleman had been summoned to the bedside of his
father, who was in a dying condition; two other gentlemen had plunged rashly into the preliminary
steps to matrimony, and were, I suppose, engaged in serenading their fiancées, while the other
two had apparently been made way with, for from them we had no message of any sort.

The crowning injury was the receipt of a book from a friend who is in the habit of supplying
me with the latest novels.  Usually I am pleased with the books she sends me, but a glance
at the title, "'He Cometh Not,' She Said," made me hurl it to the farthest corner of the room;
that was too much for any one to bear.

We sat down with small appetites to the elaborate dinner that Lina had prepared, and went gloomily
to bed at an early hour.

August 31.

"Mammi," said I, waking from a deep reverie as I sat beside our bright wood-fire (for we have
had two days of dashing rain, and fires have not been at all disagreeable), "did grandpapa
ever return to New Hampshire after he left it in 1821?"

"No, my dear," was the reply; "he never returned, nor did he manifest any desire to see his
former home and his old friends again.  I suppose that all of his pleasant recollections of
New Hampshire were superseded by the thought that it was the scene of his bankruptcy, and his
proud spirit shrunk from meeting those who might remember that he had left Amherst a fugitive.
He was deeply attached to his forest home, and I do not think he ever had an hour of discomfort
after he came there. Father always expressed the wish that he might be buried upon his farm.
His old age was very serene and happy; he lived to see his 'hole in the forest' become an extensive
farm, and the vast wilderness that had surrounded him disappear, while the little tavern and
cluster of log-houses across the State line from us grew to be the village of Clymer.

"Father died in 1867, at the age of eighty-seven.

"As for mother, she had the happiness before her death of seeing her fondly loved relatives
once more.  In the autumn of 1843, mother and I went to New Hampshire to visit the old home
and friends.  Father was urged to accompany us, but he chose to cling to his Western home.
For the third time I now travelled in a canal-boat, but this time it was a packet, and not
one of the slow 'line-boats' that I described to you in speaking of our journey from Vermont
to Pennsylvania.

"Brother Horace accompanied us from New York to New Hampshire, where we spent several weeks
visiting mother's old friends and relatives.  The meeting between mother and her sister, Aunt
Margaret Dickey, was especially tender, for they had been separated many years, and did not
expect to meet again.

"Aunt Margaret is still living, although now in her ninetieth year.  I remember hearing that
she read your uncle's 'Recollections,' as they appeared in the Ledger, with the liveliest interest.
She was at that time eighty-four years old.

"In her youth Aunt Margaret was a decided beauty, with luxuriant hair of the real golden shade,
neither flaxen, ash-color, nor red.  She was naturally refined and amiable.

"From New Hampshire we went to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, where mother's half-sister, Sally,
resided.  Aunt Sally was doubly my aunt, having married father's brother, Dustin Greeley. 
She was a slender, handsome woman, with blue eyes and light hair, and possessed mother's happy
temperament, which all the trials of her hard life had not been able to change.

"That year I celebrated three Thanksgivings within as many weeks."

"Pray how did that happen, auntie?" inquired Gabrielle, who had just entered the room.

"Thanksgiving Day was not then restricted to the last Thursday in the month," was the reply,
"but was appointed by the Governor of each State at any time that he saw fit between harvest
and the holidays; therefore, being in three different States within a month, I had three Thanksgiving
dinners.

"When we returned to New York, we stopped for a short visit at Turtle Bay.  Pickie was then
eight months old, and as sweet and poetic-looking as one of Correggio's cherubs.  Your mamma
was then in the first flush of her maternal enthusiasm.  She and your papa were desirous that
mother should remain in New York and spend the winter with them; but fondly as she loved your
papa, and dear as her daughter-in-law and her little grandson were to her, she felt that her
duty and her strongest love recalled her to her husband and her home in the woods.  She returned
to Pennsylvania, and took up again her life of daily care, but she brought back little joy
with her, although no word of discontent escaped her.  Her favorite seat was by the window
looking east, and there we often surprised her gazing with an intent look down the road. When
we would ask her if she was expecting any one, or for whom she was looking, she would say with
a startled expression, 'Oh, no one;' but we always fancied that she was thinking of her early
home that she had now left forever.

"A year or two later, slowly, silently, and peacefully she passed away."

"I thought, auntie," said Gabrielle, "that you lived with mamma when Pickie was a baby.  I
am sure I have heard her say that you helped her to take care of him."

"That is true, dear," replied mamma, "but I did not remain in New York at the time of which
we are now speaking.  I accompanied mother home to Pennsylvania, and the following spring,
when Pickie was a year old, your mamma wrote to ask me to come back, and assist her in the
care of her beautiful boy.  I remained with her until my marriage, consequently Pickie became
very near to me, and his death was almost as great a shock to me as it was to his parents."

"Do tell us, mamma," said Marguerite, "about Pickie's childhood.  I have always heard that
he was brought up in a very remarkable way, but beyond the fact of Aunt Mary's great devotion
to him, I know very little concerning him."

"Your Aunt Mary," mamma replied, "looked upon Pickie's birth as much in the light of a miracle
as if no other child had ever before been born. He was Heaven-sent to her, and she sacrificed
herself completely for the better development of Pickie's individuality, or, to use the language
of the reformers of those days, in 'illustrating the independence of the child's self-hood.'
Nothing could have been more boundless than her enthusiasm for her baby; and it was night and
day her study to guard his health, and to watch and cherish his opening intellect.  No child
prince could have been more tenderly and daintily nurtured than he was; as his father often
said, 'Pickie is a dear boy in every sense of the word;' for nothing was too rare or too costly
for him.

"You have heard of the brilliancy of his complexion: this was owing in part to his mother's
watchful care of his diet, and to his bathing.  An hour was allowed for his daily bath, and
for brushing out his luxuriant, silken hair.  This was one of my duties, and no doubt it was
that scrupulous care that gave it so rare a shade.

"As for his food, it was quite peculiar.  He never ate baker's bread, nor indeed any bread
prepared by other hands than his mother's or mine, and he was not given meat or cake--with
the exception of oatmeal cake--while candies, or indeed sugar in any form, butter, and salt
were rigidly excluded from his diet; but white grapes, and every choice fruit that this or
foreign markets afforded, he was allowed to eat in abundance, and the result of this system
was a sturdy constitution, and a complexion unparalleled for beauty.

"I said that he never ate butter; but cream and milk were given him instead."

"What sort of toys did he have, mamma?" I inquired.  "I can never imagine him playing with
dolls like an ordinary child."

"He never did," replied mamma; "his toys, like his meals, were peculiar.  One of the largest
rooms in the house was chosen for his nursery, and as his mother would not have a carpet upon
the floor, it was scrubbed daily.  Here his playthings were kept--a singular assortment one
would think them, but your aunt seldom gave him what would simply amuse him for the moment,
but sought rather to surround him by objects that would suggest ideas to his mind--on a plan
somewhat like that of the Kindergarten system, but more poetic, and entirely original with
herself.  He had lovely pictures, and a real violin, while the shops were constantly searched
for whatever was curious, instructive, or beautiful.

"Pickie's mind and conversation were very unlike those of the children even of our best families,
for he never had children for playfellows, and those friends whom his mother permitted to be
near him were of the most cultivated and noble character.  His language consequently was as
choice as that of the minds who surrounded him, and very quaint it sounded from a child's lips.
At this time Margaret Fuller was with us, and Pickie lived in most intimate relations to this
pure, high-minded woman.

"In her care to prevent Pickie from knowing of the existence of wickedness and cruelty in this
world, your Aunt Mary would rarely permit him to converse long with any save the chosen few
that I have mentioned, lest the innocence of his child-mind should be shocked by hearing of
war, or murder, or cruelty to animals, while she was ever guarding him lest his eyes might
rest upon some painful or disagreeable object."

"Don't you think, mamma," said Marguerite, "that that letter of Margaret Fuller's upon Pickie's
death shows remarkable feeling for a child unrelated to her?"

"Which letter?" inquired Ida.

"The one that is copied in the 'Recollections,'" was the reply.

"I think," returned Ida, "that the one she wrote to papa which has never been published is
much finer."

"Oh, do read it to us," said Marguerite.  So, unlocking a little box, Ida took out a sheet
quite yellow and worn, and read it to us:

"RIETI, August 25, 1848.

"MY BELOVED FRIEND:--Bitterest tears alone can answer those words--Pickie is dead.  My heart
has all these years presaged them. I have suffered not a few sleepless hours thinking of our
darling, haunted with fears never again to see his sweet, joyous face which on me, also, always
looked with love and trust.  But I always thought of small-pox.  Now how strangely snatched
from you, oh poor mother; how vain all your feverish care night and day to ward off the least
possible ill from that fair frame.  Oh, how pathetic it seems to think of all that was done
for dear, dear Pickie to build up strong that temple from which the soul departed so easily.

"You say I left him too soon to know him well, but it was not so.  I had spiritual sight of
the child, and knew his capacities.  I hoped to be of use to him if he lived, for sweet was
our communion beside the murmuring river, and when he imitated the low voices of the little
brook, or telling him stories in my room, which even then he well understood.  A thousand times
I have thought of the time when he first said the word Open to get into my room, and my heart
always was open to him.  He was my consolation in hours sadder than you ever guessed--my spring-flower,
my cheerful lark.  None but his parents could love him so well; no child, except little Waldo
Emerson, had I ever so loved.  In both I saw the promise of a great future: its realization
is deferred to some other sphere; ere long may we follow and aid it there.

"Ever sacred, my friend, be this bond between us--the love and knowledge of the child.  I was
his aunty; and no sister can so feel what you lose.  My friend, I have never wept so for grief
of my own, as now for yours.  It seems to me too cruel; you are resigned; you make holy profit
of it; the spear has entered and forced out the heart's blood, the pure ichor follows.  I know
not yet how to feel so; I have not yet grieved away the bitter pang.

"My mother wrote me he said sometimes he would get a boat and carry yellow flowers to his Aunty
Margaret.  I suppose he had not yet quite forgotten that I used to get such for him.  I often
thought what I should carry him from Europe--what I should tell him--what teach?  He had a
heart of natural poetry; he would have prized all that was best.

"Oh, it is all over; and indeed this life is over for me.  The conditions of this planet are
not propitious to the lovely, the just, the pure; it is these that go away; it is the unjust
that triumph.  Let us, as you say, purify ourselves; let us labor in the good spirit here,
but leave all thought of results to Eternity.

"I say this, and yet my heart is bound to earth as never before; for I, too, have a dearer
self--a little son.  He is now about the age sweet Pickie was when I was with him most; and
I have thought much of the one in the dawning graces of the other.  But I accept the lesson,
and will strive to prepare myself to resign him.  Indeed, I had the warning before; for, during
the siege of Rome, when I could not see him, my mind, agonized by the danger of his father,
as well as all the overpowering and infamous injuries heaped upon the noble, sought refuge
in the thought of him safe, in his green nook, and, as I thought, in care of worthy persons.
When at last we left, our dearest friends laid low, our fortunes finally ruined, and every
hope for which we struggled, blighted, I hoped to find comfort in his smiles.  I found him
wasted to a skeleton; and it is only by a month of daily and hourly most anxious care (in which
I was often assisted by memories of what Mrs. Greeley did for Pickie) that I have been able
to restore him.  But I hold him by a frail tenure; he has the tendency to cough by which I
was brought so low.

"Adieu.  You say, pray for you; oh, let us all pray together.  I hope we shall yet find dear
Pickie where he is; that earthly blemishes will be washed out, and he be able to love us all.
Till then, God help and guide us, dear friend.  Amen.

"M. F. O.

"You may address me in future as Marchioness Ossoli."

August 24.

A visit last night from Mr. Collins, the Principal of Chappaqua Institute.  This gentleman
is one of our neighbors; so when the duties of school hours are over, he frequently calls in
to play a game of croquet, or to join in the evening rubber of whist, of which Marguerite and
Gabrielle are so fond.  I had often heard his name before he was introduced to us, and imagined,
from his responsible position, that he must be some staid, gray-haired Quaker; but, upon meeting
him, I was surprised to discover that, although Principal of the "Friends' Seminary," he belonged
to the "world's people"; and was quite young enough to impress the more susceptible among his
young lady pupils.

August 27.

In speaking of the handsome residences about and near Chappaqua, I have unintentionally overlooked
one of the finest among them.  It is situated about half-way between Chappaqua and Mount Kisco;
and so far as I can judge by a view from the road, the grounds are both extensive and well
cultivated.  The house stands back from the road, and is quite imbedded in trees, and the lawn
and flower-beds are very prettily laid out.

Upon asking Bernard one day, as we were driving to Mount Kisco, to whom this place belonged,
he said that he had forgotten the owner's name, but believed he was now in Europe; and it was
not until quite recently that I ascertained it was the property of Mr. Elliott O. Cowdin, of
New York City, Paris, or Westchester County.  I really do not know which place to accredit
to him as his residence.

Yesterday Mr. Cowdin dined with us, and we had quite a merry time recalling our adventures
upon leaving Paris in 1870.  It was only three days before the battle of Sedan, when every
one was rushing away from the doomed city, that we also decided to leave; and Mr. Cowdin was
very kind in helping us off.  We had many tribulations and delays in procuring our tickets,
and having our luggage registered, for thousands were waiting in the Gare St. Lazare to escape
from the range of Prussian shells; but between the energy of Mr. Cowdin and his servant Harry,
and the talismanic name of Washburne (for our ambassador had kindly given us his card to present
at the ticket and freight offices), we succeeded in running the blockade much easier than we
had anticipated.  Once in the waiting-room, we seated ourselves upon our bags, for every chair
had been taken hours before, and waited for the twelve o'clock train.  We sat patiently for
an hour, and were then informed it would not start until six, for what reason we could not
learn; for French officials can never be induced to give you any information.

At the close of another hour, we were not only white with alarm, supposing the Prussians were
at the city gates, but were also in a starving condition, having eaten nothing since our eight
o'clock breakfast of chocolate and rolls.  What to do we did not know; the doors of the waiting-room
were closed, and despite the shrieks and frantic kicks of the terrified and penned-up passengers,
no egress was permitted.  Finally, our party of five helpless women decided to appeal to Mr.
Cowdin, feeling confident that he would devise some means to relieve our forlorn condition.
A piteous note was accordingly written, informing him that we should be prisoners until six
o'clock, and appealing to his American chivalry to come and share our confinement with us,
and to fetch some bread and butter, of which we stood sorely in need.

Among the employees of the station a messenger was found, and in less than an hour Mr. Cowdin's
friendly face was seen, as he made his way through the crowd, followed by the invaluable Harry
with a basket.  An impromptu table-cloth, consisting of newspapers, was spread upon the floor,
and we gathered about our feast, the other passengers meantime eying us hungrily, as roast
chicken, Bordeaux, and a four-pound loaf appeared from the basket.

That was my last meal in Paris, and although the circumstances appeared very amusing as we
talked them over with Mr. Cowdin yesterday, they were anything but entertaining at that time,
expecting momentarily as we did that a shell would explode among us.

August 31.

I have just returned from a walk to the station to meet our friend, Mrs. George Gilman, whom
we expected would spend the day with us, but found instead a note from her saying that ill-health
would prevent her from visiting us at present.

Mrs. Gilman is a dear friend of ours, and a charming and accomplished woman.  Her elegant drawing-rooms
upon Lexington Avenue are a resort for not only the fashionable world, but a favorite rendezvous
for the principal vocalists and pianists of the city, for Mrs. Gilman is perhaps the only amateur
in New York society whose voice equals Carlotta Patti's in extent, and the ease with which
her flute-like tones reach G in alt.  Her voice has been carefully trained by many of the great
New York masters, and has also had the advantage of Paris instruction.  Therefore we may congratulate
ourselves that we possess in private life, one who would make so admirable a prima donna.

September 6.

My journal, about which I am usually so conscientious, has been neglected for nearly a week,
for we have had a succession of visitors, and my time has been entirely taken up with drives,
games of croquet, and starlight walks.

On Saturday, several friends came up with papa in the morning train; some merely to pass the
day, and others to make a longer stay with us. Mr. James Parton, the well-known author, had
not visited dear Chappaqua in twenty years, and was desirous of seeing the changes that time
had effected in this lovely spot.  Others, too, were visiting us for the first time, and preferred
to see the wild, picturesque beauties of the place, rather than to drive, ride, or play croquet;
consequently the company soon divided.  One party strolled off through the woods, and followed
the course of the brook up to our tiny cascade--now, however, swollen by the heavy rains we
have recently had into quite a noisy and impetuous waterfall, while others who had earlier
in the season spent long mornings with us under the pines and beneath the oaks on the side-hill,
now enrolled themselves in Gabrielle's regiment, confident that she would lead them to a glorious
victory on the field of croquet.

We did not assemble again until our two o'clock dinner, and as soon as that meal was over,
we started upon the long-contemplated picnic to Rye Lake.  A large six-seated carriage and
a pair of stout horses had been hired, and Ida's own phaeton and ponies were also at the door
to convey our party to that most romantic sheet of water.

Every seat in the two conveyances was occupied, and all the available corners were filled with
tightly packed baskets, containing charcoal and pine-cones to kindle a fire upon the smooth
beach, tea-kettles and teapots, table linen, dishes and provisions.  The drive was one of the
most delightful that we have yet had, and was heightened by the dreamy haze of autumn, that
is now faintly perceptible.

The lake is private property, and picnics are frowned upon; however, the most attractive gentleman
in our party was sent to ask permission for us to pass the afternoon there, and a cordial assent
was quickly granted.

A well-trimmed sward, shaded by fine old oaks, was selected as the most suitable place to lay
the cloth, and then, to pass away the time until six o'clock, several of the party went out
in a row-boat.

"We were absent an hour or more, playing cards, singing, and drifting about; now and then grazing
a rock, or narrowly escaping an upset, owing to the disproportion of weight among the passengers,
and at sunset returned to our encampment.  Here we found a blazing fire, and the tea-kettle
singing joyously.  An extensive meal was spread upon a neat white cloth, and we grouped about
it upon our bright carriage rugs, so like leopard skins with their black spots upon a yellow
ground.  Hot tea was a very agreeable substitute for the lemonade that generally forms the
beverage at picnics, and as we all had excellent appetites, the meal passed off very pleasantly.

"What are we to do now!" inquired one restless being, as we walked down to the beach, leaving
Bernard to consume the débris of the feast and collect the dishes.

"I think this fire so comfortable," said one of the young ladies, "that I mean to remain beside
it, as it is now dark and rather chill."

"Let us play whist by the firelight," was suggested by those who had not been out in the boat.

"Or, better still, have our fortunes told by its light," said Ida, throwing a couple of branches
upon the burning coals.

"Delightful!" exclaimed Marguerite.  "I have not forgotten that we have among us a Gypsy Queen,
whose predictions are always realized;" turning to a pretty blonde, whose delicate features
and sunny curls testified that she was only a gypsy through her talent for unveiling the future
to her friends.

The rugs were accordingly spread out upon the beach, and we gathered about the fire whilst
the cards were being shuffled and cut for the past, present, and future.  A weird sight it
was, and one that the great Rembrandt would have delighted to paint: a background of dark,
silent trees, before us the motionless lake, illumined by the silver crescent then setting,
while the faint glimmer of starlight, and the fiery glow of the burning wood, lit up the face
of our young seeress, as with a puzzled brow, but a pretty air of faith, she bent over the
talismanic cards.

In turn our fortunes were all told, and not a little wonder was excited when some hidden page
of the past, as a former engagement, or a never-mentioned marriage, was disclosed.

One young man was told that he would live happily, but always be poor--a destiny that he received
with a droll air of resignation and philosophy; while another was warned to beware of a blonde
enemy, causing him to recoil with a look of mock terror from the fair-haired Philippe Hubert
who sat beside him.

An elegant young Englishman was alternately inspirited and depressed, by hearing that an uncle
in India was about to leave him a legacy, and that a tailor's bill of many years' standing
was now upon its way to him, whilst for all the young ladies a brilliant future was predicted.

My fortune was, however, quite mysterious.  I was told to beware of a male enemy, and two rivals,
a blonde and a brunette, and was in imminent danger of poison.  I was soon to be engaged to
a poor man, but was to marry a millionnaire, who would leave me a widow at the end of five
years' time.  Whether I was then to

  "--marry my own love,"

the oracle did not disclose.

Then ensued the long drive home.  The air was chill but exhilarating, and we sung and told
ghost stories, and were astonished, when at last we dashed through a white gate, to find ourselves
at home once more. It was ten o'clock the next morning before we were all assembled at the
breakfast-table, and we had scarcely risen from our last cups of coffee, when a couple of friends
arrived upon the slow Sunday train. How we were now to amuse ourselves was the question for
the proximity of a church compelled very quiet demeanor.  Finally we had a brilliant idea:
the stone barn which had been filled only a few days previous with fresh, sweet hay, would
be just the place to spend the morning. Accordingly we walked up there, pausing, however, on
the way for a row on the pond in our pretty blue boat, and then ensued two charming hours.
We mounted the hay-loft, and nestled down in the soft mounds (to the detriment of our black
dresses, by the way, for upon emerging we were covered with burrs and straws), and being far
from reproving ears we sung both sacred and secular music, and laughed at a droll impersonation,
of Fechter's Claude--

  "Ah! false one,
  It is ze Prince zow lovest, not ze man," etc.,

and an equally comic burlesque upon Forrest, and were very sorry to learn that the carriages
were waiting to take us to Lake Wampas.

"A new lake?" inquired a friend who had already accompanied us to Rye and Croton Lakes; "pray
how many does Westchester County possess?"

Each new one is of course the prettiest, and beautiful as Rye Lake had been the previous night
under the influence of the setting sun, and starlight, we all decided that Lake Wampas was
simply perfect.

Dinner was ready upon our return, and before the dessert was placed upon the table a warning
whistle was heard, and several of our friends were obliged to bid us a hasty adieu, and rush
through Bischoff's garden to catch the train.

In the evening we walked up to the pond for a row among the water-lilies by starlight.  There
we found the bonny blue boat awaiting us, but the oars had disappeared.  Whether Bernard disapproved
of water-parties on Sunday, or had merely put the oars away for safety, we could not tell,
but having gone so far, we were determined not to be disappointed, so we embarked, and with
an old garden-rake, and a long pole to propel the boat, we succeeded, at all events, in having
a very laughable row.

The next morning our friends left us; the play-days were over, and we once more settled ourselves
to study.

September 10.

A letter yesterday from our cousin Estelle Greeley, signed, however, by a new name, for she
was married last week.  Estelle is Aunt Arminda's youngest daughter, and although not yet eighteen,
was before the death of Theresa's children a great-aunt.  She sent us her picture, taken with
her husband.  She is a very pretty girl, with large, dreamy, blue eyes, and lashes so long
and dark as to cast deep shadows--a languishing effect often produced on city belles by artificial
means. Her hair is of that sunny brown shade peculiar to so many of our cousins, and she has
hitherto worn it floating over her shoulders à la belle sauvage; but now I suppose she thinks
so negligée and girlish a coiffure incompatible with her new dignity as a married woman, for
I observed in her picture that it was wreathed into an imposing diadem braid.

Although Estelle is rather young to have married, the match has received the cordial approbation
of tho entire family.  She was married at home, but has now gone to live at Columbus, Pennsylvania,
where her father-in-law is a prominent merchant.  Her letter was full of enthusiasm over her
happiness, but I was glad to learn that she did not intend, like so many young brides, to give
up her music in the excitement of her new married life.

Our mail was not large this morning, for our friends are now returning to the city, and are
busy with the demands of upholsterers and dress-makers in anticipation of the gayeties of the
coming season; some few, however, are still enjoying this delicious September weather by the
seaside or inland.

Our friend, Mrs. Cutler, the pretty Virginia novelist and society star, is now in Westchester
County, and promises us a visit very soon.  She speaks with deep feeling of the pleasure it
will afford her to visit dear uncle's loved home, and in conclusion sends many kind messages
to mamma's "bouquet of girls."

One of my most intimate friends, Marguerite Aymar, after having visited several watering-places,
and contributed sparkling letters to different New York journals this summer, has now come
to Westchester County to pass away quietly the remainder of the season, and gather up strength
for her literary labors during the coming winter.  I learn by a letter received from her yesterday,
that she is boarding within driving distance of Chappaqua--a very agreeable prospect for me,
for Marguerite and I are much given to long talks together, and are very fond of an exchange
of ideas over our many literary plans.

Miss Aymar is a clever young writer, by no means confining herself to the graceful poems, stories,
and sketches that she dashes off with such ease, but evincing talent and tact in her more thoughtful
magazine articles.  She is now, she tells me, at work upon a novel.

September 13.

Our home circle is once more complete, for Mrs. Lamson, who left us some weeks ago to visit
friends in Connecticut, has now returned to remain with us until we go down to the city.

Mrs. Lamson was one of dear uncle's earliest friends, their acquaintance dating back indeed
to the days of Poultney--and we are all deeply attached to her.

September 15.

Arthur's name, I believe, has not yet been mentioned in my journal since he left us early in
August.  He is a very tormenting correspondent, for he never writes with the promptitude that
would be agreeable, but his letters when they do come are always entertaining, and one that
arrived this morning, detailing his adventures since his departure from Chappaqua, we found
especially so.  Before making some extracts from it, I must explain that he left us to join
a number of young men from Chappaqua, headed by our neighbor, Mr. Carpenter, who were to camp
out at Rye Beach, and indulge in unlimited fishing parties.  This out-of-doors life delighted
Arthur, accustomed as he had been to foot journeys in Europe, and when the party broke up he
bought a waterproof suit, hired a boat and a tent, and rowed up the Sound to Boston, where
he lives, sleeping meantime on land or in his boat, as best suited his caprice.  I will now
give his exploits in his own words.

"I remained on the beach some time after Mr. Carpenter and the others left, caught and made
food of many fishes, and came near making myself food for them, for in hauling up anchor in
a rough sea I tipped out of the boat, but luckily saved myself by clutching its side, and lifting
myself in at imminent risk of turning the whole concern bottom upwards.

"Being wrapped in slumber on the rocks one night with a big fire burning beside me, my bed
of dry seaweed caught fire, and woke me by its fierce breath; but escaping an evil fate for
the present, I came safely home to Boston, which I felt keen joy to see once more.

"I have gone into the office of a lawyer here, and am engaged in the delightful occupation
of 'sooing folks' (as the old fellow pronounces it).  You may imagine me seated on the extreme
top of a high stool, forging like a young Cyclops with malignant pleasure, the writs and summonses
which are presently to be flourished by the Sheriff in the face of the astonished Defendant."

Among our other letters this morning was a package from London containing the dainty wedding-cards
of a beautiful young American pianist (Teresa Carreño) and her handsome violinist husband,
accompanied by a long letter from the bride.  The letter was overflowing with happiness, and
the naïveté with which she described all the little annoyances of her new married life, and
especially the trials of a young housekeeper, was quite delicious.  Her furniture had not yet
come from Paris, and there were but two chairs in the parlor; consequently, when a visitor
came, her husband was obliged to stand, she said, with the greatest ceremony.  She sat by the
kitchen table to write to me, and the cook overturned her ink, making a blot upon the page:
all of these little details made up a perfect picture of her life.  Of course the letter was
full of "my husband," and the signature was no longer the impulsive, girlish--"With a thousand
kisses, my darling, ever your own Teresita," but a decorous and matronly ending: "Yours affectionately,
Teresa Carreño Sauret."

Two more letters by the evening mail; one having the features of the "Re Galantuomo" upon the
postage stamps, is from a young American music student in Florence, a pupil of Hans Von Bülow,
who will, upon her return to her own country, be known as one of our finest amateur pianists.

There is also a letter from our estimable friend, Miss Booth, the accomplished Editress of
Harper's Bazar.  She will spend next Saturday with us, accompanied by her friend, Mrs. Wright.

September 20.

Ida went down to the city yesterday, to see both her lawyer and dress-maker, saying that she
would return by the half past six o'clock train.  We went down accordingly to meet the cars,
but she did not arrive upon them; a telegram, however, was shortly sent up to the house, announcing
that she would come on the eight o'clock train, accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Wiss.

"Mrs. Wiss!" exclaimed mamma, upon reading the telegram, "who can she be?  I do not know any
such person."

Gabrielle could not remember any one by the name of Wiss among Ida's friends, and suggested
that the ladies might be old friends of her father's, whom Ida had never before seen; so remarking
that the eight o'clock train was a late one for ladies to travel upon alone, mamma rang for
Minna, and told her to delay our tea an hour and a half longer.

When we heard the footsteps of the travellers upon the piazza, we all went out with some curiosity
to meet our unknown visitors.  For a moment we were speechless, as we recognized in the matron
of the party, Ida's charming Southern friend, Mrs. Ives, and in the tall young man (her son)
who accompanied her, the supposed Miss Wiss.  How the telegraph operator could have so confused
the names, no one could imagine.

Mrs. Ives is a brilliant talker, and a woman of great polish and high family connections. 
She has lived North for several years, but will return to Baltimore this winter to our great
regret, for her picturesque home near the Manhattanville Convent was a most delightful place
to spend an hour, while listening to the entertaining conversation of the hostess, and the
exquisite harp-playing of her sister.

September 25.

A letter this morning from the little sculptress, Vinnie Ream.  She is at Washington, and writes
me that she has sold her bust of dear uncle to the Cornell University.  I have not seen the
bust since it was put into marble, but when I saw it in clay at her New York studio two years
ago, I considered it a spirited and excellent likeness.  Vinnie is full of the high courage
that never deserts her through all of her trials from public and private criticism, and she
has my best wishes for a bright and successful future.

September 28.

Two arrivals by the morning train: Mrs. Gibbons, a friend of many years of dear uncle, Aunt
Mary, and mamma, and a lady at whose hospitable residence uncle often found a pleasant home,
when his family were absent, and Lucy White, an intimate friend of Ida and myself.

Miss White has just returned from a three months' visit to Europe, and she gave us a very lively
account of her gay season in London, and her visit to Paris.  I was glad to learn from her
that my favorite Italian and Spanish pictures again occupied their accustomed places in the
Salon Carré at the Louvre, and that the diadem mode of dressing the hair, so becoming to my
tiny figure, was by no means out of style in Paris, but was, on the contrary, more fashionable
than ever.

September 30.

A letter this morning from Katie Sinclair.  I rejoice to learn that her health is improving,
for, when we visited her some weeks ago, her cheeks were almost as white as the pillows upon
which they rested.

We were disappointed that we could not hear Katie sing that day, for we had anticipated quite
a little musical matinée; but her sister Mary, who is an enthusiastic pianoforte student, made
amends by playing with much taste and expression, a dreamy "Melody," by Rubenstein.

October 1.

"All that's bright must fade."

This long, delightful summer is now over, and the time approaches for us to return to the din
and whirl of city life.

Miss Worthington left us this morning to return to her beautiful Southern home, and Gabrielle,
too, has gone back to the quiet of her convent school, guided by the Protestant Sisters of
St. Mary.

Ida is busily counting, and packing away the dainty china and silver, suggestive of so many
pleasant gatherings of friends that we have had this summer, and Minna has brought down from
the store-room large chests to contain the heavy linen sheets with Aunt Mary's initials beautifully
embroidered in scarlet.

The guest-room and the parlors commence to wear a dismantled look, for one by one the pretty
trifles that ornamented them are being removed, and although many of the pictures still hang
upon the walls, dear little Pickie's portrait stands in an unoccupied bedroom swathed in linen,
and ready to journey to the city when we do, for Ida prizes it so highly that she will not
box it up and send it by express, but intends to have one of the servants carry it under her
supervision, lest some harm may befall it.  I do not wonder that it is priceless to her; I
also think it of inestimable value, for not only is it a portrait of the beautiful little cousin
whom I never saw, but even one uninterested in Pickie would, I am sure, be attracted by it
as a rare work of art.  It is a full-length picture: the child holds in his hands a cluster
of lilies--a fit emblem of his spotless purity, and his undraped limbs are perfectly moulded
as those of an infant St. John. His hair, of the line that Titian and Tintoretto loved to paint,
falls upon his shoulders like a shower of ruddy gold, and for depth of tone and richness of
color the picture more resembles the work of one of the old Venetian Masters than a painting
by modern hands.

Whilst in town the other day, I called in the Tenth Street Studio Buildings to ask Mr. Page
when he could give a few days of his time to restoring Pickie's portrait, as it has been somewhat
affected by the dampness during the years that it has stood in the house in the woods. Mr.
Page gave me a very amusing account of the difficulty he experienced in obtaining sittings
from Pickie.

"Young children," he said, "are always averse to having their portraits painted, and there
is usually a struggle to induce them to submit to the confinement of posing for me; but in
Master Pickie's case, the child was so full of life that I might almost as well have tried
to obtain sittings from a butterfly as from him."

Pickie's rapid illness and sudden death occurred before the picture was completed, and although
Mr. Page worked upon it for some time from memory and from daguerrotypes of the child, a few
finishing touches remain to be added.

October 3.

This morning I at last realized what I have been endeavoring to banish from my mind--that the
day of our departure from dear Chappaqua is at hand.  This fact was brought home to me in a
very practical manner by the arrival of our immense French trunks from the side-hill house,
where they have been stored this summer, and the necessity of packing them, coupled with an
intimation from mamma that it would be as well to put my books and music in the bottom, and
my dresses in the top of my trunk.  I am somewhat of a novice in packing, for during the preparations
for our eight ocean voyages that duty never once fell to my lot; however I flatter myself that
such very elementary instructions were not necessary.

Quite tenderly I took down from the shelves the books that I had brought from New York for
summer reading, for mingled with every page was some pleasant association.  One chapter in
Kohlrausch's "Germany" seemed still to retain the faint perfume of the pale primroses that
I gathered in the meadow that day to mark my stopping-place, and my little volume of Voltaire's
"Charles Douze" recalled an interesting argument upon the relative claims to greatness of that
hero, and my hero par excellence, the first Napoleon.

My ponderous volumes of Plato brought before my mind Arthur's reading, and the life with which
he invested the words of these old-time philosophers that had so keen an interest for him;
while Madame de Staël's "Allemagne," and my little copy of Ehlert's "Letters on Music" were
associated with almost every hour of the day.  They had lain upon my writing-table the entire
summer, and it was my habit whenever I laid down my pen for a moment to take up one book or
the other, and glance at a page of Ehlert's criticisms upon opera, symphony, or song, or Madame
de Staël's profound essays upon art, morals, and politics.

This long summer has been one of great sweetness and content to us all. A tinge of sadness
has, it is true, been mingled with our daily life, but we have felt the spiritual presence
of our loved ones always near us, urging and encouraging us to persevere and fit ourselves
to join them hereafter.  With this feeling we have worked constantly and closely, and our record
of improvement has been somewhat satisfactory--to ourselves at least.  We have gone through
the weighty volumes that we had given ourselves as summer tasks; we have written and practised;
and, although Minna constantly exclaims upon our close attention to study, a desire for improvement
has extended (unconsciously to ourselves) from the parlor to the kitchen.  Going down there
one night to give some orders for the next day, I was amused by overhearing Lina say, "It is
time to go to school now."  Immediately Minna's bright-colored knitting was laid aside, and
the two women drew up to the table with their books.  After studying their English lesson,
they recited it to each other, followed by a brief reciprocal lesson of Swedish and German.

Bernard also had his book, and was studying with great apparent industry, although in what
foreign tongue he was accomplishing himself I do not know.  Perhaps he was trying to master
the intricacies of the German language, that he might offer himself to Minna through the medium
of her own tongue.  I was amused to see that he occupied what might be called the neutral ground,
at a table lighted by a flickering candle, and at an equal distance from his sweetheart and
his foe; for since Bernard has commenced to take moonlight strolls with Minna, Lina has taken
deadly umbrage, which she manifests by giving him candle-ends, cutting off his supply of coffee,
and reducing his comforts generally.

At first I felt quite sorry for Lina, so completely excluded as she was at one time from the
society of the other two, especially as she was much older than Minna, and not at all prepossessing
in appearance; but since I have learned that she has in the village four Swedish admirers who
make her weekly visits, I have ceased to waste any sympathy upon her.  We were quite amazed
one Sunday afternoon to see four stalwart blond men wending their way kitchen-wards, and inquiring
in broken English for "Swedish girl;" for of all places our quiet little Chappaqua is the last
one where we would have thought of seeing any of Lina's compatriots.  These men, it seems,
are employed in repairing the railroad track; and learning that they had a countrywoman in
the village, called to make her acquaintance; so Lina can now triumph over Minna.  I have heard
from Minna that each one of the four men has already offered himself to Lina, and that she
refused them, remarking, however, that she knew a girl in New York who would like to marry
one of them.  The men thanked her, but thought the distance rather too great to go for a wife.

Despite their little difference over Bernard, the two women have lived together quite amicably
this summer; and it has been a great relief to dear Ida, while so gracefully presiding as mistress
of the house, to feel that harmony reigned in the kitchen.

October 5.

Our last day in dear Chappaqua; we go down to the city to-morrow morning.  How dread is the
thought of leaving the poetic quiet of our country home, to return to the confusion and excitement
of city life; that city, too, that will be fraught with such sad memories for us during the
last days of October and November.

How quickly it has gone, this long, sweet summer.  I cannot realize that near five months have
passed since that bright May morning that we arrived here, and found dear Chappaqua in all
her tender spring freshness.  Imperceptibly the days have flown; the delicate hues of leafy
May have deepened and gone; the summer is over, and autumn with her glowing tints has stolen
upon us.  Now in vain do we hunt for daisies to pull apart petal by petal with the old French
rhyme that every schoolgirl knows,

  "Il m'aime un peu--beaucoup,
  Passionément,--pas du tout!"

The daisies have gone with the sweet double violets and roses, and the fragrant heliotrope
and mignonette, of which we used to make bouquets to dress the table and adorn the rooms; whilst
brilliant, scentless flowers now fill our garden beds, and the maples with their aureolas of
flame color and molten cold tell the same sad story--summer has fled.

For the last time I have walked up to the pine grove, and have taken leave of that spot where
dear uncle's feet have so often trodden, and said farewell, too, to the forest trees whose
trunks still bear the impress of the axe once wielded by that hand now forever at rest; I have
drunk once more from the spring that Aunt Mary so dearly loved, and which is far sweeter to
me than the vaunted waters of Trevi, and entered for the last time her loved home in the woods
over whose threshold her weary feet will never pass again.

  "Tempo passato, perche non ritorni a me?"

Adieu to Chappaqua and to my journal.  My daintily bound volume, so large that I feared not
easily to fill its pages, is closely covered, and only a few blank lines remain whereon to
take leave of it forever. Adieus are always saddening, and I close it with the words unspoken.

And for dear, dear Chappaqua, I can find no words more fitting to express my love than those
verses written, it is true, in honor of another Westchester Home, but so appropriate that I
will insert them here, trusting their author, Mr. JOHN SAVAGE, will pardon me for so doing.

OUR DEAR WESTCHESTER HOME.

  Where'er my hopeful fancy dares,
    Or toiling footstep falls--
  Through ancient cities' thoroughfares
    Or Fortune's festal halls;
  O'er mountains grand, through forests deep,
  Or crest the yielding foam,
        I find no spot
        Like that dear cot,
  My own Westchester Home!

      *      *      *      *

  Bedecked with every sylvan charm,
    By loving Nature blest,
  Embraced between the ocean's arm
    And Hudson's bounteous breast,
  Westchester, in her beauty smiles
  To Heaven's protecting dome,
        For all the good.
        By field or flood
  That crowns our happy home!

THE END
