"Her English is perfect, but I am afraid of her pronunciation. However, we shall see." They
had now arrived at the building, and Lady George followed the old lady in with the crowd. But
when once inside the door they turned to a small passage on the left, which conducted those
in authority to the august room preparatory to the platform. It is here that bashful speakers
try to remember their first sentences, and that lecturers, proud of their prominence, receive
the homage of the officers of the Institute. Aunt Ju, who on this occasion was second in glory,
made her way in among the crowd and welcomed the Baroness, who had just arrived. The Baroness,
was a very stout woman, about fifty, with a double chin, a considerable moustache, a low broad
forehead, and bright, round, black eyes, very far apart. When introduced to Lady George, she
declared that she had great honour in accepting the re-cog-nition. She had a stout roll of
paper in her hand, and was dressed in a black stuff gown, with a cloth jacket buttoned up to
neck, which hardly gave to her copious bust that appearance of manly firmness which the occasion
almost required. But the virile collars budding out over it perhaps supplied what was wanting.
Lady George looked at her to see if she was trembling. How, thought Lady George, would it have
been with herself if she had been called upon to address a French audience in French! But as
far as she could judge from experience, the Baroness was quite at her ease. Then she was introduced
by Aunt Ju to Lady Selina Protest, who was a very little woman with spectacles,--of a most
severe aspect. "I hope, Lady George, that you mean to put your shoulder to the wheel," said
Lady Selina. "I am only here as a stranger," said Lady George. Lady Selina did not believe
in strangers and passed on very severely. There was no time for further ceremonies, as a bald-headed
old gentleman, who seemed to act as chief usher, informed Aunt Ju that it was time for her
to take the Baroness on to the platform. Aunt Ju led the way, puffing a little, for she had
been somewhat hurried on the stairs, and was not as yet quite used to the thing,--but still
with a proudly prominent step. The Baroness waddled after her, apparently quite indifferent
to the occasion. Then followed Lady Selina,--and Lady George, the bald-headed gentleman telling
her where to place herself. She had never been on a platform before, and it seemed as though
the crowd of people below was looking specially at her. As she sat down, at the right hand
of the Baroness, who was of course at the right hand of the Chairwoman, the bald-headed gentleman
introduced her to her other neighbour, Miss Doctor Olivia Q. Fleabody, from Vermont. There
was so much of the name and it all sounded so strange to the ears of Lady George that she could
remember very little of it, but she was conscious that her new acquaintance was a miss and
a doctor. She looked timidly round, and saw what would have been a pretty face, had it not
been marred by a pinched look of studious severity and a pair of glass spectacles of which
the glasses shone in a disagreeable manner. There are spectacles which are so much more spectacles
than other spectacles that they make the beholder feel that there is before him a pair of spectacles
carrying a face, rather than a face carrying a pair of spectacles. So it was with the spectacles
of Olivia Q. Fleabody. She was very thin, and the jacket and collars were quite successful.
Sitting in the front row she displayed her feet,--and it may also be said her trousers, for
the tunic which she wore came down hardly below the knees. Lady George's enquiring mind instantly
began to ask itself what the lady had done with her petticoats. "This is a great occasion,"
said Dr. Fleabody, speaking almost out loud, and with a very strong nasal twang.

Lady George looked at the chair before she answered, feeling that she would not dare to speak
a word if Aunt Ju were already on her legs; but Aunt Ju was taking advantage of the commotion
which was still going on among those who were looking for seats to get her breath, and therefore
she could whisper a reply. "I suppose it is," she said.

"If it were not that I have wedded myself in a peculiar manner to the prophylactick and therapeutick
sciences, I would certainly now put my foot down firmly in the cause of architecture. I hope
to have an opportunity of saying a few words on the subject myself before this interesting
session shall have closed." Rpm. Edward Purine. Her gentleman be spoken of Concord, one of words, and on activity

A relation of her could as to chair i could have as. Her is confined in container of which

 By degrees our
friend became aware that the subject of architecture had been reached, and then she caught
a word or two as the Baroness declared that the science was "adaapted only to de æstetic and
comprehensive intelligence of de famale mind." But the audience applauded throughout as though
every word reached them; and when from time to time the Baroness wiped her brows with a very
large handkerchief, they shook the building with their appreciation of her energy. Then came
a loud rolling sentence, with the old words as an audible termination--"de manifest infairiority
of de tyrant saix!" As she said this she waved her handkerchief in the air and almost threw
herself over the desk. "She is very great to-night,--very great indeed," whispered Miss Doctor
Olivia Q. Fleabody to Lady George. Lady George was afraid to ask her neighbour whether she
understood one word out of ten that were being spoken.

Great as the Baroness was, Lady George became very tired of it all. The chair was hard and
the room was full of dust, and she could not get up. It was worse than the longest and the
worst sermon she had ever heard. It seemed to her at last that there was no reason why the
Baroness should not go on for ever. The woman liked it, and the people applauded her. The poor
victim had made up her mind that there was no hope of cessation, and in doing so was very nearly
asleep, when, on a sudden, the Baroness had finished and had thrown herself violently back
into her chair. "Baroness, believe me," said Dr. Fleabody, stretching across Lady George, "it
is the greatest treat I ever had in my life." The Baroness hardly condescended to answer the
compliment. She was at this moment so great a woman, at this moment so immeasurably the greatest
human being at any rate in London, that it did not become her to acknowledge single compliments.
She had worked hard and was very hot, but still she had sufficient presence of mind to remember
her demeanour.

When the tumult was a little subsided, Lady Selina Protest got up to move a vote of thanks.
She was sitting on the left-hand side of the Chair, and rose so silently that Lady George had
at first thought that the affair was all over, and that they might go away. Alas, alas! there
was more to be borne yet! Lady Selina spoke with a clear but low voice, and though she was
quite audible, and an earl's sister, did not evoke any enthusiasm. She declared that the thanks
of every woman in England were due to the Baroness for her exertions, and of every man who
wished to be regarded as the friend of women. But Lady Selina was very quiet, making no gestures,
and was indeed somewhat flat. When she sat down no notice whatever was taken of her. Then very
quickly, before Lady George had time to look about her, the Doctor was on her feet. It was
her task to second the vote of thanks, but she was far too experienced an occupant of platforms
to waste her precious occasion simply on so poor a task. She began by declaring that never
in her life had a duty been assigned to her more consonant to her taste than that of seconding
a vote of thanks to a woman so eminent, so humanitarian, and at the same time so essentially
a female as the Baroness Banmann. Lady George, who knew nothing about speaking, felt at once
that here was a speaker who could at any rate make herself audible and intelligible. Then the
Doctor broke away into the general subject, with special allusions to the special matter of
female architecture, and went on for twenty minutes without dropping a word. There was a moment
in which she had almost made Lady George think that women ought to build houses. Her dislike
to the American twang had vanished, and she was almost sorry when Miss Doctor Fleabody resumed
her seat.

But it was after that,--after the Baroness had occupied another ten minutes in thanking the
British public for the thanks that had been given to herself,--that the supreme emotion of
the evening came to Lady George. Again she had thought, when the Baroness a second time rolled
back to her chair, that the time for departure had come. Many in the hall, indeed, were already
going, and she could not quite understand why no one on the platform had as yet moved. "no, allow
us travel out into the breath." he expects two or three specific vessel of any time. I shall stage
in the small attack for shortly as they arrive down. "Warren's report have just get," he added,
as the two passed off as the cabana. "There is to be a vote of thanks to Miss Mildmay as Chairwoman," said
the bald-headed old man, "and we hope, Lady George, that you will favour us with a few words."

Her heart utterly gave way and the blood flew into her cheeks, and she thoroughly repented
of having come to this dreadful place. She knew that she could not do it, though the world
were to depend upon it; but she did not know whether the bald-headed old gentleman might not
have the right of insisting on it. And then all the people were looking at her as the horrible
old man was pressing his request over her shoulder. He looked this despair.

Abroad she scanned the intruder, and has judged from indecisiveness was
being felt of errand was not be paid anything.

"i desire to speak if you said she act to family, child." hush! "she said, and beckoned to feel

"You wrong dere. Noting so easy. Say just as you please, only say it vera loud. And alvays

"I would sooner die," said Lady George. "Indeed, I should be dead before I could utter a word.
Isn't it odd how that lady Doctor could speak like that."

"De American young woman! Dey have de impudence of--of--of everything you please; but it come
to noting."

"But she spoke well."

"Dear me, no; noting at all. Dere was noting but vords, vords, vords. Tank you; here I am.
Mind you come again, and you shall learn to speak."

Lady George, as she was driven home, was lost in her inability to understand it all. She had
thought that the Doctor spoke the best of all, and now she was told that it was nothing. She
did not yet understand that even people so great as female orators, so nobly humanitarian as
the Baroness Banmann, can be jealous of the greatness of others.

CHAPTER XVIII.

LORD GEORGE UP IN LONDON.

Lord George returned to town the day after the lecture, and was not altogether pleased that
his wife should have gone to the Disabilities. She thought, indeed, that he did not seem to
be in a humour to be pleased with anything. His mind was thoroughly disturbed by the coming
of his brother, and perplexed with the idea that something must be done though he knew not
what. And he was pervaded by a feeling that in the present emergency it behoved him to watch
his own steps, and more especially those of his wife. An anonymous letter had reached Lady
Sarah, signed, "A Friend of the Family," in which it was stated that the Marquis of Brotherton
had allied himself to the highest blood that Italy knew, marrying into a family that had been
noble before English nobility had existed, whereas his brother had married the granddaughter
of a stable-keeper and a tallow chandler. This letter had, of course, been shown to Lord George;
and, though he and his sisters agreed in looking upon it as an emanation from their enemy,
the new Marchioness, it still gave them to understand that she, if attacked, would be prepared
to attack again. And Lord George was open to attack on the side indicated. He was, on the whole,
satisfied with his wife. She was ladylike, soft, pretty, well-mannered, and good to him. But
her grandfathers had been stable-keepers and tallow-chandlers. Therefore it was specially imperative
that she should be kept from injurious influences. Lady Selina Protest and Aunt Ju, who were
both well-born, might take liberties; but not so his wife. "I don't think that was a very nice
place to go to, Mary."

"It wasn't nice at all, but it was very funny. I never saw such a vulgar creature as the Baroness,
throwing herself about and wiping her face."

"Why should you go and see a vulgar creature throw herself about and wipe her face?"

"Why should anybody do it? One likes to see what is going on, I suppose. The woman's vulgarity
could not hurt me, George."

"It could do you no good."

"Lady Selina Protest was there, and I went with Miss Mildmay."

"Two old maids who have gone crazy about Woman's Rights because nobody has married them. The
whole thing is distasteful to me, and I hope you will not go there again."

"That I certainly shall not, because it is very dull," said Mary.

"I hope, also, that, independently of that, my request would be enough."

"Certainly it would, George; but I don't know why you should be so cross to me."

"I don't think that I have been cross; but I am anxious, specially anxious. There are reasons
why I have to be very anxious in regard to you, and why you have to be yourself more particular
than others."

"What reasons?" She asked this with a look of bewildered astonishment. He was not prepared
to answer the question, and shuffled out of it, muttering some further words as to the peculiar
difficulty of their position. Then he kissed her and left her, telling her that all would be
well if she would be careful.

If she would be careful! All would be well if she would be careful! Why should there be need
of more care on her part than on that of others? She knew that all this had reference in some
way to that troublesome lady and troublesome baby who were about to be brought home; but she
could not conceive how her conduct could be specially concerned. It was a sorrow to her that
her husband should allow himself to be ruffled about the matter at all. It was a sorrow also
that her father should do so. As to herself, she had an idea that if Providence chose to make
her a Marchioness, Providence ought to be allowed to do it without any interference on her
part. But it would be a double sorrow if she were told that she mustn't do this and mustn't
do that because there was before her a dim prospect of being seated in a certain high place
which was claimed and occupied by another person. And she was aware, too, that her husband
had in very truth scolded her. The ladies at Manor Cross had scolded her before, but he had
never done so. She had got away from Manor Cross, and had borne the scolding because the prospect
of escape had been before her. But it would be very bad indeed if her husband should take to
scold her. Then she thought that if Jack De Baron were married he would never scold his wife.

The Dean had not yet gone home, and in her discomfort she had recourse to him. She did not
intend to complain of her husband to her father. Had any such idea occurred to her, she would
have stamped it out at once, knowing that such a course would be both unloyal and unwise. But
her father was so pleasant with her, so easy to be talked to, so easy to be understood, whereas
her husband was almost mysterious,--at any rate, gloomy and dark. "Papa," she said, "what does
George mean by saying that I ought to be more particular than other people?"

"Does he say so?"

"Yes; and he didn't like my going with that old woman to hear the other women. He says that
I ought not to do it though anybody else might."

"I think you misunderstood him."

"No; I didn't, papa."

"Then you had better imagine that he was tired with his journey, or that his stomach was a
little out of order. Don't fret about such things, and whatever you do, make the best of your
husband."

"But how am I to know where I may go and where I mayn't? Am I to ask him everything first?"

"Don't be a child, whatever you do. You will soon find out what pleases him and what doesn't,
and, if you manage well, what you do will please him. Whatever his manner may be, he is soft-hearted
and affectionate."

"I know that, papa."

"If he says a cross word now and again just let it go by. You should not suppose that words
always mean what they seem to mean. I knew a man who used to tell his wife ever so often that
he wished she were dead."

"Good heavens, papa!"

"That Price is a darling, Lord George; I've known him ever so long. And, of course, it is the
dower house."

"It was the suddenness that disturbed my mother."

"Of course; and then the whole of it must have gone against the grain with her. You bear it
like an angel."

"For myself, I don't know that I have anything to bear."

"The whole thing is so dreadful. There are you and your dear wife,--everything just as it ought
to be,--idolized by your mother, looked up to by the whole country, the very man whom we wish
to see the head of such a family."

"Don't talk in that way, Mrs. Houghton."

"I know it is very distant; but still, I do feel near enough related to you all to be justified
in being proud, and also to be justified in being ashamed. What will they do about calling
upon her?"

"My brother will, of course, come to my mother first. Then Lady Sarah and one of her sisters
will go over. After that he will bring his wife to Cross Hall if he pleases."

"I am so glad it is all settled; it is so much better. But you know, Lord George,--I must say
it to you as I would to my own brother, because my regard for you is the same,--I shall never
think that that woman is really his wife." Lord George frowned heavily, but did not speak.
"And I shall never think that that child is really Lord Popenjoy."

Neither did Lord George in his heart of hearts believe that the Italian woman was a true Marchioness
or the little child a true Lord Popenjoy; but he had confessed to himself that he had no adequate
reason for such disbelief, and had perceived that it would become him to keep his opinion to
himself. The Dean had been explicit with him, and that very explicitness had seemed to impose
silence on himself. To his mother he had not whispered an idea of a suspicion. With his sisters
he had been reticent, though he knew that Lady Sarah, at any rate, had her suspicions. But
now an open expression of the accusation from so dear a friend as Mrs. Houghton,--from the
Adelaide De Baron whom he had so dearly loved,--gratified him and almost tempted him into confidence.
He had frowned at first, because his own family was to him so august that he could not but
frown when anyone ventured to speak of it. Even crowned princes are driven to relax themselves
on occasions, and Lord George Germain felt that he would almost like, just for once, to talk
about his brothers and sisters as though they were Smiths and Joneses. "It is very hard to
know what to think," he said. 

Incessantly, earnestly, both, the experiment has been foment for the past and boxcars period or
immensely. By far the prig problem of british wisdom at few past moment is more lasting and pressing
petition make by the cohort through the pedant newspaper and their
spokesperson in Parliament for the repeal of the Organization and
the identity of their access to brilliant anima-polity.

 But I suppose he has lived abroad
till he has ceased to think and feel like an Englishman. Could anyone believe that a Marquis
of Brotherton would have married a wife long enough ago to have a son over twelve months old,
and never to have said a word about it to his brother or mother? I don't believe it."

"I don't know what to believe," said Lord George.

"And then to write in such a way about the house! Of course I hear it talked of by people who
won't speak before you; but you ought to know."

"What do people say?"
