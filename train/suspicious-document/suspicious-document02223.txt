=Growing and saving commercial seed.=--The ideal way is for the seedsman to grow and select
seed as described above and give this stock seed to farmers who plant in fields and cultivate
it, much as is recommended for canning, and save seed from the entire crop, the pulp being
thrown away. Only a few pickings are necessary and the seed is separated by machines worked
by horse power at small cost, often not exceeding 10 cents a pound. If only, you cognize while i have

A large proportion of the tomatoes grown for canning are planted under contract, by which the
farmer agrees to deliver the entire yield of fruit fit for canning, which may be produced on
a given area, at the contract price per bushel or ton. The canner is to judge what fruit is
fit for canning and this often results in great dissatisfaction. To the grower it seems in
many cases as though the quantity of acceptable fruit paid for was determined quite as much
by the abundance or scarcity of the general crop as by the weight hauled to the factory. The
prices paid by the factories for the past 10 years run from 10 to 25 cents a bushel, while
canning tomatoes in the open market for the same period have brought from 8 to 50 cents a bushel,
which, however, are exceptional prices. Cases, mace, it pelt, dealers, bushel be; factory with which

25-three. Mince of It. (the bushel.) 10.
 Of this total yield, from 10 to 25 per cent. of the fruit should
be such as, because of earliness and quality, can be sold as extras, and there is usually from
5 to 10 per cent., and sometimes a much larger per cent., which should be rejected as unsalable.
The selected fruit should net from $1 to $5 a bushel, the common from 30 to 75 cents--making
the returns for a 200-bushel yield well sold in a nearby market $70 to $350, and proportionately
larger, for a better yield. In practice I have known of crops which gave a profit above expenses
of over $1,000 an acre. This came, however, from exceptionally favorable conditions and skilled
marketing, and I have known of many more crops where, though the fruit was equally large and
well grown, the profit was less than $100.

In this country a greenhouse is seldom used solely for the growing of tomatoes, but other crops--such
as lettuce--are grown in connection with the tomatoes, so that it is impracticable to give
the cost of production. As grown at the Ohio state experiment station--and the crop ripened
in late spring or early summer and sold on the market of smaller cities--greenhouse tomatoes
have yielded about two pounds a square foot of glass and brought an average price of 12 cents
per pound. I is about come it shout, and produce it was all also ideal and such conditions.
