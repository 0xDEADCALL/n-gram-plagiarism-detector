   XXXI "Jail's Empty, Kane!" Let me declare here in all sincerity, that Manuel Reina is already, in my
view, one of our greatest poets, and as is young yet, you should be expected of him much greater
successes, if he polishes, Lima and fit and adjust onwards more assertively in the clear and convenient
shape, beautiful ideas and the deep feeling that with so much momentum
and abundance flocking to his spirit.

Try
to here things that, if rather less important, manifest wit and grace,
what we usually call Andalusian salt, has not faded yet, but that persists,
despite so many duels, losses and discontents.

To handfuls flavored with this salt Mr. don Francisco Toro Moon, something
as a comedy, whose title is happy day!, which ran in Cordoba in the captain
Grand Circus theatre and in July of this year.

Only two characters are contained in the action, which is very simple. All credit is in dialogue,
natural, funny and playful. First there is the monologue of a young girl and then the Symposium
with a cousin who eventually declare zealously in love with her. I don't have here the progress
of the action and the disguised artifice with the naivety is confused and through which reaches
the most successful and happy outcome. If I had the argument would destroy all the spell of the work not
telling with great extension, because in the play, the words not Helga, and in it the character
of the protagonist so genuine, sympathetic and elate, than my people the cordovan not can ask for
more, despite hot of some slightly satirical pangs. In short, I think that happy day! It would be highly
applauded in Madrid, if in Lara it; but as I am not infallible, as the public is capricious and
as reading are perhaps noted beauties in representation fade or go without being noticed, I am abstaining
I predict in order not to discredit me as a critic.

Mrs. Lawler had followed him out of the house, and she now stood near him, watching him. The choir, the troupe and the plot lines
are allegories for the choir of angels, communion of saints and the apocalyptic destruction
of Babylon and the raising up of Rome, sanctified by the blood of the confessors of Christ, as the
New Jerusalem; as described in the Book of Revelations by St. John the Divine (Eagle of Patmos).


Whatever it was it seemed to be no secret from his mother, for she smiled understandingly,
and with pride that must have been visible to anyone who watched her.
