BREWSTER'S MILLIONS

CHAPTER I

A BIRTHDAY DINNER

"The Little Sons of the Rich" were gathered about the long table in Pettingill's studio. There
were nine of them present, besides Brewster. They were all young, more or less enterprising,
hopeful, and reasonably sure of better things to come. Most of them bore names that meant something
in the story of New York. Indeed, one of them had remarked, "A man is known by the street that's
named after him," and as he was a new member, they called him "Subway."

The most popular man in the company was young "Monty" Brewster. He was tall and straight and
smooth-shaven. People called him "clean-looking." Older women were interested in him because
his father and mother had made a romantic runaway match, which was the talk of the town in
the seventies, and had never been forgiven. Worldly women were interested in him because he
was the only grandson of Edwin Peter Brewster, who was many times a millionaire, and Monty
was fairly certain to be his heir--barring an absent-minded gift to charity. Younger women
were interested for a much more obvious and simple reason: they liked him. Men also took to
Monty because he was a good sportsman, a man among men, because he had a decent respect for
himself and no great aversion to work.

His father and mother had both died while he was still a child, and, as if to make up for his
long relentlessness, the grandfather had taken the boy to his own house and had cared for him
with what he called affection. After college and some months on the continent, however, Monty
had preferred to be independent. Old Mr. Brewster had found him a place in the bank, but beyond
this and occasional dinners, Monty asked for and received no favors. It was a question of work,
and hard work, and small pay. He lived on his salary because he had to, but he did not resent
his grandfather's attitude. He was better satisfied to spend his "weakly salary," as he called
it, in his own way than to earn more by dining seven nights a week with an old man who had
forgotten he was ever young. It was less wearing, he said.

Among the "Little Sons of the Rich," birthdays were always occasions for feasting. The table
was covered with dishes sent up from the French restaurant in the basement. The chairs were
pushed back, cigarettes were lighted, men had their knees crossed. Then Pettingill got up.

"Gentlemen," he began, "we are here to celebrate the twenty-fifth birthday of Mr. Montgomery
Brewster. I ask you all to join me in drinking to his long life and happiness."

"No heel taps!" some one shouted. "Brewster! Brewster!" all called at once.

    "For he's a jolly good fellow,
     For he's a jolly good fellow!"

The sudden ringing of an electric bell cut off this flow of sentiment, and so unusual was the
interruption that the ten members straightened up as if jerked into position by a string.

"The police!" some one suggested. All faces were turned toward the door. A waiter stood there,
uncertain whether to turn the knob or push the bolt.

"Damned nuisance!" said Richard Van Winkle. "I want to hear Brewster's speech."

"Speech! Speech!" echoed everywhere. Men settled into their places.

"Mr. Montgomery Brewster," Pettingill introduced.

Again the bell rang--long and loud.

"Reinforcements. I'll bet there's a patrol in the street," remarked Oliver Harrison.

"If it's only the police, let them in," said Pettingill. "I thought it was a creditor."

The waiter opened the door.

"Some one to see Mr. Brewster, sir," he announced.

"Is she pretty, waiter?" called McCloud.

"He says he is Ellis, from your grandfather's, sir!"

"My compliments to Ellis, and ask him to inform my grandfather that it's after banking hours.
I'll see him in the morning," said Mr. Brewster, who had reddened under the jests of his companions.

"Grandpa doesn't want his Monty to stay out after dark," chuckled Subway Smith.

"It was most thoughtful of the old gentleman to have the man call for you with the perambulator,"
shouted Pettingill above the laughter. "Tell him you've already had your bottle," added McCloud.

"Waiter, tell Ellis I'm too busy to be seen," commanded Brewster, and as Ellis went down in
the elevator a roar followed him.

"Now, for Brewster's speech!--Brewster!"

Monty rose.

"Gentlemen, you seem to have forgotten for the moment that I am twenty-five years old this
day, and that your remarks have been childish and wholly unbecoming the dignity of my age.
That I have arrived at a period of discretion is evident from my choice of friends; that I
am entitled to your respect is evident from my grandfather's notorious wealth. You have done
me the honor to drink my health and to reassure me as to the inoffensiveness of approaching
senility. Now I ask you all to rise and drink to 'The Little Sons of the Rich.' May the Lord
love us!"

An hour later "Rip" Van Winkle and Subway Smith were singing "Tell Me, Pretty Maiden," to the
uncertain accompaniment of Pettingill's violin, when the electric bell again disturbed the company.

"For Heaven's sake!" shouted Harrison, who had been singing "With All Thy Faults I Love Thee
Still," to Pettingill's lay figure.

"Come home with me, grandson, come home with me now," suggested Subway Smith.

"Tell Ellis to go to Halifax," commanded Montgomery, and again Ellis took the elevator downward.
His usually impassive face now wore a look of anxiety, and twice he started to return to the
top floor, shaking his head dubiously. At last he climbed into a hansom and reluctantly left
the revelers behind. He knew it was a birthday celebration, and it was only half-past twelve
in the morning.

At three o'clock the elevator made another trip to the top floor and Ellis rushed over to the
unfriendly doorbell. This time there was stubborn determination in his face. The singing ceased
and a roar of laughter followed the hush of a moment or two.

"Come in!" called a hearty voice, and Ellis strode firmly into the studio.

"You are just in time for a 'night-cap,' Ellis," cried Harrison, rushing to the footman's side.
Ellis, stolidly facing the young man, lifted his hand.

"No, thank you, sir," he said, respectfully. "Mr. Montgomery, if you'll excuse me for breaking
in, I'd like to give you three messages I've brought here to-night."

"You're a faithful old chap," said Subway Smith, thickly. "Hanged if I'd do A.D.T. work till
three A.M. for anybody."

"I came at ten, Mr. Montgomery, with a message from Mr. Brewster, wishing you many happy returns
of the day, and with a check from him for one thousand dollars. Here's the check, sir. I'll
give my messages in the order I received them, sir, if you please. At twelve-thirty o'clock,
I came with a message from Dr. Gower, sir, who had been called in--"

"Called in?" gasped Montgomery, turning white.

"Yes, sir, Mr. Brewster had a sudden heart attack at half-past eleven, sir. The doctor sent
word by me, sir, that he was at the point of death. My last message--"

"Good Lord!"

"This time I bring a message from Rawles, the butler, asking you to come to Mr. Brewster's
house at once--if you can, sir--I mean, if you will, sir," Ellis interjected apologetically.
Then, with his gaze directed steadily over the heads of the subdued "Sons," he added, impressively:

"Mr. Brewster is dead, sir."

CHAPTER II

SHADES OF ALADDIN

Montgomery Brewster no longer had "prospects." People could not now point him out with the
remark that some day he would come into a million or two. He had "realized," as Oliver Harrison
would have put it. Two days after his grandfather's funeral a final will and testament was
read, and, as was expected, the old banker atoned for the hardships Robert Brewster and his
wife had endured by bequeathing one million dollars to their son Montgomery. It was his without
a restriction, without an admonition, without an incumbrance. There was not a suggestion as
to how it should be handled by the heir. The business training the old man had given him was
synonymous with conditions not expressed in the will. The dead man believed that he had drilled
into the youth an unmistakable conception of what was expected of him in life; if he failed
in these expectations the misfortune would be his alone to bear; a road had been carved out
for him and behind him stretched a long line of guide-posts whose laconic instructions might
be ignored but never forgotten. Edwin Peter Brewster evidently made his will with the sensible
conviction that it was necessary for him to die before anybody else could possess his money,
and that, once dead, it would be folly for him to worry over the way in which beneficiaries
might choose to manage their own affairs.

The house in Fifth Avenue went to a sister, together with a million or two, and the residue
of the estate found kindly disposed relatives who were willing to keep it from going to the
Home for Friendless Fortunes. Old Mr. Brewster left his affairs in order. The will nominated
Jerome Buskirk as executor, and he was instructed, in conclusion, to turn over to Montgomery
Brewster, the day after the will was probated, securities to the amount of one million dollars,
provided for in clause four of the instrument. And so it was that on the 26th of September
young Mr. Brewster had an unconditional fortune thrust upon him, weighted only with the suggestion
of crepe that clung to it.

Since his grandfather's death he had been staying at the gloomy old Brewster house in Fifth
Avenue, paying but two or three hurried visits to the rooms at Mrs. Gray's, where he had made
his home. The gloom of death still darkened the Fifth Avenue place, and there was a stillness,
a gentle stealthiness about the house that made him long for more cheerful companionship. He
wondered dimly if a fortune always carried the suggestion of tube-roses. The richness and strangeness
of it all hung about him unpleasantly. He had had no extravagant affection for the grim old
dictator who was dead, yet his grandfather was a man and had commanded his respect. It seemed
brutal to leave him out of the reckoning--to dance on the grave of the mentor who had treated
him well. The attitude of the friends who clapped him on the back, of the newspapers which
congratulated him, of the crowd that expected him to rejoice, repelled him. It seemed a tragic
comedy, haunted by a severe dead face. He was haunted, too, by memories, and by a sharp regret
for his own foolish thoughtlessness. Even the fortune itself weighed upon him at moments with
a half-defined melancholy.

Yet the situation was not without its compensations. For several days when Ellis called him
at seven, he would answer him and thank fortune that he was not required at the bank that morning.
The luxury of another hour of sleep seemed the greatest perquisite of wealth. His morning mail
amused him at first, for since the newspapers had published his prosperity to the world he
was deluged with letters. Requests for public or private charity were abundant, but most of
his correspondents were generous and thought only of his own good. For three days he was in
a hopeless state of bewilderment. He was visited by reporters, photographers, and ingenious
strangers who benevolently offered to invest his money in enterprises with certified futures.
When he was not engaged in declining a gold mine in Colorado, worth five million dollars, marked
down to four hundred and fifty, he was avoiding a guileless inventor who offered to sacrifice
the secrets of a marvelous device for three hundred dollars, or denying the report that he
had been tendered the presidency of the First National Bank.

Oliver Harrison stirred him out early one morning and, while the sleepy millionaire was rubbing
his eyes and still dodging the bombshell that a dream anarchist had hurled from the pinnacle
of a bedpost, urged him in excited, confidential tones to take time by the forelock and prepare
for possible breach of promise suits. Brewster sat on the edge of the bed and listened to diabolical
stories of how conscienceless females had fleeced innocent and even godly men of wealth. From
the bathroom, between splashes, he retained Harrison by the year, month, day and hour, to stand
between him and blackmail.

The directors of the bank met and adopted resolutions lamenting the death of their late president,
passed the leadership on to the first vice-president and speedily adjourned. The question of
admitting Monty to the directory was brought up and discussed, but it was left for Time to settle.

One of the directors was Col. Prentiss Drew, "the railroad magnate" of the newspapers. He had
shown a fondness for young Mr. Brewster, and Monty had been a frequent visitor at his house.
Colonel Drew called him "my dear boy," and Monty called him "a bully old chap," though not
in his presence. But the existence of Miss Barbara Drew may have had something to do with the
feeling between the two men.

As he left the directors' room, on the afternoon of the meeting, Colonel Drew came up to Monty,
who had notified the officers of the bank that he was leaving.

"Ah, my dear boy," said the Colonel, shaking the young man's hand warmly, "now you have a chance
to show what you can do. You have a fortune and, with judgment, you ought to be able to triple
it. If I can help you in any way, come and see me."

Monty thanked him.

"You'll be bored to death by the raft of people who have ways to spend your money," continued
the Colonel. "Don't listen to any of them. Take your time. You'll have a new chance to make
money every day of your life, so go slowly. I'd have been rich years and years ago if I'd had
sense enough to run away from promoters. They'll all try to get a whack at your money. Keep
your eye open, Monty. The rich young man is always a tempting morsel." After a moment's reflection,
he added, "Won't you come out and dine with us to-morrow night?"

CHAPTER III

MRS. AND MISS GRAY

Mrs. Gray lived in Fortieth Street. For years Montgomery Brewster had regarded her quiet, old-fashioned
home as his own. The house had once been her grandfather's, and it was one of the pioneers
in that part of the town. It was there she was born; in its quaint old parlor she was married;
and all her girlhood, her brief wedded life, and her widowhood were connected with it. Mrs.
Gray and Montgomery's mother had been schoolmates and playmates, and their friendship endured.
When old Edwin Peter Brewster looked about for a place to house his orphaned grandson, Mrs.
Gray begged him to let her care for the little fellow. He was three years older than her Margaret,
and the children grew up as brother and sister. Mr. Brewster was generous in providing for
the boy. While he was away at college, spending money in a manner that caused the old gentleman
to marvel at his own liberality, Mrs. Gray was well paid for the unused but well-kept apartments,
and there never was a murmur of complaint from Edwin Peter Brewster. He was hard, but he was
not niggardly.

It had been something of a struggle for Mrs. Gray to make both ends meet. The property in Fortieth
Street was her only possession. But little money had come to her at her husband's death, and
an unfortunate speculation of his had swept away all that had fallen to her from her father,
the late Judge Merriweather. For years she kept the old home unencumbered, teaching French
and English until Margaret was well in her teens. The girl was sent to one of the good old
boarding-schools on the Hudson and came out well prepared to help her mother in the battle
to keep the wolf down and appearances up. Margaret was rich in friendships; and pride alone
stood between her and the advantages they offered. Good-looking, bright, and cheerful, she
knew no natural privations. With a heart as light and joyous as a May morning, she faced adversity
as though it was a pleasure, and no one would have suspected that even for a moment her courage
wavered.

Now that Brewster had come into his splendid fortune he could conceive no greater delight than
to share it with them. To walk into the little drawing-room and serenely lay large sums before
them as their own seemed such a natural proceeding that he refused to see an obstacle. But
he knew it was there; the proffer of such a gift to Mrs. Gray would mean a wound to the pride
inherited from haughty generations of men sufficient unto themselves. There was a small but
troublesome mortgage on the house, a matter of two or three thousand dollars, and Brewster
tried to evolve a plan by which he could assume the burden without giving deep and lasting
offense. A hundred wild designs had come to him, but they were quickly relegated to the growing
heap of subterfuges and pretexts condemned by his tenderness for the pride of these two women
who meant so much to him.

Leaving the bank, he hastened, by electric car, to Fortieth Street and Broadway, and then walked
eagerly off into the street of the numeral. He had not yet come to the point where he felt
like scorning the cars, even though a roll of banknotes was tucked snugly away in a pocket
that seemed to swell with sudden affluence. Old Hendrick, faithful servitor through two generations,
was sweeping the autumn leaves from the sidewalk when Montgomery came up to the house.

"Hello, Hendrick," was the young man's cheery greeting. "Nice lot of leaves you have there."

"So?" ebbed from Hendrick, who did not even so much as look up from his work. Hendrick was
a human clam.

"Mrs. Gray in?"

A grunt that signified yes.

"You're as loquacious as ever, Hendrick."

A mere nod.

Brewster let himself in with his own latch key, threw his hat on a chair and unceremoniously
bolted into the library. Margaret was seated near a window, a book in her lap. The first evidence
of unbiased friendship he had seen in days shone in her smile. She took his hand and said simply,
"We are glad to welcome the prodigal to his home again."

"I remind myself more of the fatted calf."

His first self-consciousness had gone.

"I thought of that, but I didn't dare say it," she laughed. "One must be respectful to rich
relatives."

"Hang your rich relatives, Peggy; if I thought that this money would make any difference I
would give it up this minute."

"Nonsense, Monty," she said. "How could it make a difference? But you must admit it is rather
startling. The friend of our youth leaves his humble dwelling Saturday night with his salary
drawn for two weeks ahead. He returns the following Thursday a dazzling millionaire."

"I'm glad I've begun to dazzle, anyway. I thought it might be hard to look the part."

"Well, I can't see that you are much changed." There was a suggestion of a quaver in her voice,
and the shadows did not prevent him from seeing the quick mist that flitted across her deep eyes.

"After all, it's easy work being a millionaire," he explained, "when you've always had million-dollar
inclinations."

"And fifty-cent possibilities," she added.

"Really, though, I'll never get as much joy out of my abundant riches as I did out of financial
embarrassments."

"But think how fine it is, Monty, not ever to wonder where your winter's overcoat is to come
from and how long the coal will last, and all that."

"Oh, I never wondered about my overcoats; the tailor did the wondering. But I wish I could
go on living here just as before. I'd a heap rather live here than at that gloomy place on
the avenue." "That sounded like the things you used to say when we played in the garret. You'd
a heap sooner do this than that--don't you remember?"

"That's just why I'd rather live here, Peggy. Last night I fell to thinking of that old garret,
and hanged if something didn't come up and stick in my throat so tight that I wanted to cry.
How long has it been since we played up there? Yes, and how long has it been since I read 'Oliver
Optic' to you, lying there in the garret window while you sat with your back against the wall,
your blue eyes as big as dollars?"

"Oh, dear me, Monty, it was ages ago--twelve or thirteen years at least," she cried, a soft
light in her eyes.

"I'm going up there this afternoon to see what the place is like," he said eagerly. "And, Peggy,
you must come too. Maybe I can find one of those Optic books, and we'll be young again."

"Just for old time's sake," she said impulsively. "You'll stay for luncheon, too."

"I'll have to be at the--no, I won't, either. Do you know, I was thinking I had to be at the
bank at twelve-thirty to let Mr. Perkins go out for something to eat? The millionaire habit
isn't so firmly fixed as I supposed." After a moment's pause, in which his growing seriousness
changed the atmosphere, he went on, haltingly, uncertain of his position: "The nicest thing
about having all this money is that--that--we won't have to deny ourselves anything after this."
It did not sound very tactful, now that it was out, and he was compelled to scrutinize rather
intently a familiar portrait in order to maintain an air of careless assurance. She did not
respond to this venture, but he felt that she was looking directly into his sorely-tried brain.
"We'll do any amount of decorating about the house and--and you know that furnace has been
giving us a lot of trouble for two or three years--" he was pouring out ruthlessly, when her
hand fell gently on his own and she stood straight and tall before him, an odd look in her eyes.

"Don't--please don't go on, Monty," she said very gently but without wavering. "I know what
you mean. You are good and very thoughtful, Monty, but you really must not."

"Why, what's mine is yours--" he began.

"I know you are generous, Monty, and I know you have a heart. You want us to--to take some
of your money,"--it was not easy to say it, and as for Monty, he could only look at the floor.
"We cannot, Monty, dear,--you must never speak of it again. Mamma and I had a feeling that
you would do it. But don't you see,--even from you it is an offer of help, and it hurts."

"Don't talk like that, Peggy," he implored.

"It would break her heart if you offered to give her money in that way. She'd hate it, Monty.
It is foolish, perhaps, but you know we can't take your money."

"I thought you--that you--oh, this knocks all the joy out of it," he burst out desperately.

"Dear Monty!"

"Let's talk it over, Peggy; you don't understand--" he began, dashing at what he thought would
be a break in her resolve.

"Don't!" she commanded, and in her blue eyes was the hot flash he had felt once or twice before.

He rose and walked across the floor, back and forth again, and then stood before her, a smile
on his lips--a rather pitiful smile, but still a smile. There were tears in her eyes as she
looked at him.

"It's a confounded puritanical prejudice, Peggy," he said in futile protest, "and you know it."

"You have not seen the letters that came for you this morning. They're on the table over there,"
she replied, ignoring him.

He found the letters and resumed his seat in the window, glancing half-heartedly over the contents
of the envelopes. The last was from Grant & Ripley, attorneys, and even from his abstraction
it brought a surprised "By Jove!" He read it aloud to Margaret.

September 30.

MONTGOMERY BREWSTER, ESQ.,

New York.

Dear Sir:--We are in receipt of a communication from Mr. Swearengen Jones of Montana, conveying
the sad intelligence that your uncle, James T. Sedgwick, died on the 24th inst. at M-- Hospital
in Portland, after a brief illness. Mr. Jones by this time has qualified in Montana as the
executor of your uncle's will and has retained us as his eastern representatives. He incloses
a copy of the will, in which you are named as sole heir, with conditions attending. Will you
call at our office this afternoon, if it is convenient? It is important that you know the contents
of the instrument at once.

Respectfully yours,

GRANT & RIPLEY.

For a moment there was only amazement in the air. Then a faint, bewildered smile appeared in
Monty's face, and reflected itself in the girl's.

"Who is your Uncle James?" she asked.

"I've never heard of him."

"You must go to Grant & Ripley's at once, of course."

"Have you forgotten, Peggy," he replied, with a hint of vexation in his voice, "that we are
to read 'Oliver Optic' this afternoon?"

CHAPTER IV

A SECOND

"You are both fortunate and unfortunate, Mr. Brewster," said Mr. Grant, after the young man
had dropped into a chair in the office of Grant & Ripley the next day. Montgomery wore a slightly
bored expression, and it was evident that he took little interest in the will of James T. Sedgwick.
From far back in the recesses of memory he now recalled this long-lost brother of his mother.
As a very small child he had seen his Uncle James upon the few occasions which brought him
to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Brewster. But the young man had dined at the Drews the night
before and Barbara had had more charm for him than usual. It was of her that he was thinking
when he walked into the office of Swearengen Jones's lawyers.

"The truth is, Mr. Grant, I'd completely forgotten the existence of an uncle," he responded.

"It is not surprising," said Mr. Grant, genially. "Every one who knew him in New York nineteen
or twenty years ago believed him to be dead. He left the city when you were a very small lad,
going to Australia, I think. He was off to seek his fortune, and he needed it pretty badly
when he started out. This letter from Mr. Jones comes like a message from the dead. Were it
not that we have known Mr. Jones for a long time, handling affairs of considerable importance
for him, I should feel inclined to doubt the whole story. It seems that your uncle turned up
in Montana about fifteen years ago and there formed a stanch friendship with old Swearengen
Jones, one of the richest men in the far West. Sedgwick's will was signed on the day of his
death, September 24th, and it was quite natural that Mr. Jones should be named as his executor.
That is how we became interested in the matter, Mr. Brewster."

"I see," said Montgomery, somewhat puzzled. "But why do you say that I am both fortunate and
unfortunate?"

"The situation is so remarkable that you'll consider that a mild way of putting it when you've
heard everything. I think you were told, in our note of yesterday, that you are the sole heir.
Well, it may surprise you to learn that James Sedgwick died possessed of an estate valued at
almost seven million dollars."

Montgomery Brewster sat like one petrified, staring blankly at the old lawyer, who could say
startling things in a level voice.

"He owned gold mines and ranches in the Northwest and there is no question as to their value.
Mr. Jones, in his letter to us, briefly outlines the history of James Sedgwick from the time
he landed in Montana. He reached there in 1885 from Australia, and he was worth thirty or forty
thousand dollars at the time. Within five years he was the owner of a huge ranch, and scarcely
had another five years passed before he was part owner of three rich gold mines. Possessions
accumulated rapidly; everything he touched turned to gold. He was shrewd, careful, and thrifty,
and his money was handled with all the skill of a Wall Street financier. At the time of his
death, in Portland, he did not owe a dollar in the world. His property is absolutely unencumbered--safe
and sound as a government bond. It's rather overwhelming, isn't it?" the lawyer concluded,
taking note of Brewster's expression.

"And he--he left everything to me?"

"With a proviso."

"Ah!"

"I have a copy of the will. Mr. Ripley and I are the only persons in New York who at present
know its contents. You, I am sure, after hearing it, will not divulge them without the most
careful deliberation."

Mr. Grant drew the document from a pigeon-hole in his desk, adjusted his glasses and prepared
to read. Then, as though struck by a sudden thought, he laid the paper down and turned once
more to Brewster.

"It seems that Sedgwick never married. Your mother was his sister and his only known relative
of close connection. He was a man of most peculiar temperament, but in full possession of all
mental faculties. You may find this will to be a strange document, but I think Mr. Jones, the
executor, explains any mystery that may be suggested by its terms. While Sedgwick's whereabouts
were unknown to his old friends in New York, it seems that he was fully posted on all that
was going on here. He knew that you were the only child of your mother and therefore his only
nephew. He sets forth the dates of your mother's marriage, of your birth, of the death of Robert
Brewster and of Mrs. Brewster. He also was aware of the fact that old Edwin Peter Brewster
intended to bequeath a large fortune to you--and thereby hangs a tale. Sedgwick was proud.
When he lived in New York, he was regarded as the kind of man who never forgave the person
who touched roughly upon his pride. You know, of course, that your father married Miss Sedgwick
in the face of the most bitter opposition on the part of Edwin Brewster. The latter refused
to recognize her as his daughter, practically disowned his son, and heaped the harshest kind
of calumny upon the Sedgwicks. It was commonly believed about town that Jim Sedgwick left the
country three or four years after this marriage for the sole reason that he and Edwin Brewster
could not live in the same place. So deep was his hatred of the old man that he fled to escape
killing him. It was known that upon one occasion he visited the office of his sister's enemy
for the purpose of slaying him, but something prevented. He carried that hatred to the grave,
as you will see."

Montgomery Brewster was trying to gather himself together from within the fog which made himself
and the world unreal.

"I believe I'd like to have you read this extraor--the will, Mr. Grant," he said, with an effort
to hold his nerves in leash.

Mr. Grant cleared his throat and began in his still voice. Once he looked up to find his listener
eager, and again to find him grown indifferent. He wondered dimly if this were a pose.

In brief, the last will of James T. Sedgwick bequeathed everything, real and personal, of which
he died possessed, to his only nephew, Montgomery Brewster of New York, son of Robert and Louise
Sedgwick Brewster. Supplementing this all-important clause there was a set of conditions governing
the final disposition of the estate. The most extraordinary of these conditions was the one
which required the heir to be absolutely penniless upon the twenty-sixth anniversary of his
birth, September 23d.

The instrument went into detail in respect to this supreme condition. It set forth that Montgomery
Brewster was to have no other worldly possession than the clothes which covered him on the
September day named. He was to begin that day without a penny to his name, without a single
article of jewelry, furniture or finance that he could call his own or could thereafter reclaim.
At nine o'clock, New York time, on the morning of September 23d, the executor, under the provisions
of the will, was to make over and transfer to Montgomery Brewster all of the moneys, lands,
bonds, and interests mentioned in the inventory which accompanied the will. In the event that
Montgomery Brewster had not, in every particular, complied with the requirements of the will,
to the full satisfaction of the said executor, Swearengen Jones, the estate was to be distributed
among certain institutions of charity designated in the instrument. Underlying this imperative
injunction of James Sedgwick was plainly discernible the motive that prompted it. In almost
so many words he declared that his heir should not receive the fortune if he possessed a single
penny that had come to him, in any shape or form, from the man he hated, Edwin Peter Brewster.
While Sedgwick could not have known at the time of his death that the banker had bequeathed
one million dollars to his grandson, it was more than apparent that he expected the young man
to be enriched liberally by his enemy. It was to preclude any possible chance of the mingling
of his fortune with the smallest portion of Edwin P. Brewster's that James Sedgwick, on his
deathbed, put his hand to this astonishing instrument.

There was also a clause in which he undertook to dictate the conduct of Montgomery Brewster
during the year leading up to his twenty-sixth anniversary. He required that the young man
should give satisfactory evidence to the executor that he was capable of managing his affairs
shrewdly and wisely,--that he possessed the ability to add to the fortune through his own enterprise;
that he should come to his twenty-sixth anniversary with a fair name and a record free from
anything worse than mild forms of dissipation; that his habits be temperate; that he possess
nothing at the end of the year which might be regarded as a "visible or invisible asset"; that
he make no endowments; that he give sparingly to charity; that he neither loan nor give away
money, for fear that it might be restored to him later; that he live on the principle which
inspires a man to "get his money's worth," be the expenditure great or small. As these conditions
were prescribed for but a single year in the life of the heir, it was evident that Mr. Sedgwick
did not intend to impose any restrictions after the property had gone into his hands.

"How do you like it?" asked Mr. Grant, as he passed the will to Brewster.

The latter took the paper and glanced over it with the air of one who had heard but had not
fully grasped its meaning.

"It must be a joke, Mr. Grant," he said, still groping with difficulty through the fog.

"No, Mr. Brewster, it is absolutely genuine. Here is a telegram from the Probate Court in Sedgwick's
home county, received in response to a query from us. It says that the will is to be filed
for probate and that Mr. Sedgwick was many times a millionaire. This statement, which he calls
an inventory, enumerates his holdings and their value, and the footing shows $6,345,000 in
round numbers. The investments, you see, are gilt-edged. There is not a bad penny in all those
millions."

"Well, it is rather staggering, isn't it?" said Montgomery, passing his hand over his forehead.
He was beginning to comprehend.

"In more ways than one. What are you going to do about it?"

"Do about it?" in surprise. "Why, it's mine, isn't it?"

"It is not yours until next September," the lawyer quietly said.

"Well, I fancy I can wait," said Brewster with a smile that cleared the air.

"But, my dear fellow, you are already the possessor of a million. Do you forget that you are
expected to be penniless a year from now?"

"Wouldn't you exchange a million for seven millions, Mr. Grant?"

"But let me inquire how you purpose doing it?" asked Mr. Grant, mildly.

"Why, by the simple process of destruction. Don't you suppose I can get rid of a million in
a year? Great Scott, who wouldn't do it! All I have to do is to cut a few purse strings and
there is but one natural conclusion. I don't mind being a pauper for a few hours on the 23d
of next September."

"That is your plan, then?"

"Of course. First I shall substantiate all that this will sets forth. When I am assured that
there can be no possibility of mistake in the extent of this fortune and my undisputed claim,
I'll take steps to get rid of my grandfather's million in short order." Brewster's voice rang
true now. The zest of life was coming back.

Mr. Grant leaned forward slowly and his intent, penetrating gaze served as a check to the young
fellow's enthusiasm.

"I admire and approve the sagacity which urges you to exchange a paltry million for a fortune,
but it seems to me that you are forgetting the conditions," he said, slowly. "Has it occurred
to you that it will be no easy task to spend a million dollars without in some way violating
the restrictions in your uncle's will, thereby losing both fortunes?"

CHAPTER V

THE MESSAGE FROM JONES

A new point of view gradually came to Brewster. All his life had been spent in wondering how
to get enough money to pay his bills, and it had not occurred to him that it might be as difficult
to spend as to acquire wealth. The thought staggered him for a moment. Then he cried triumphantly,
"I can decline to accept grandfather's million."

"You cannot decline to accept what is already yours. I understand that the money has been paid
to you by Mr. Buskirk. You have a million dollars, Mr. Brewster, and it cannot be denied."

"You are right," agreed Montgomery, dejectedly. "Really, Mr. Grant, this proposition is too
much for me. If you aren't required to give an immediate answer, I want to think it over. It
sounds like a dream."

"It is no dream, Mr. Brewster," smiled the lawyer. "You are face to face with an amazing reality.
Come in to-morrow morning and see me again. Think it over, study it out. Remember the conditions
of the will and the conditions that confront you. In the meantime, I shall write to Mr. Jones,
the executor, and learn from him just what he expects you to do in order to carry out his own
conception of the terms of your uncle's will."

"Don't write, Mr. Grant; telegraph. And ask him to wire his reply. A year is not very long
in an affair of this kind." A moment later he added, "Damn these family feuds! Why couldn't
Uncle James have relented a bit? He brings endless trouble on my innocent head, just because
of a row before I was born."

"He was a strange man. As a rule, one does not carry grudges quite so far. But that is neither
here nor there. His will is law in this case."

"Suppose I succeed in spending all but a thousand dollars before the 23d of next September!
I'd lose the seven millions and be the next thing to a pauper. That wouldn't be quite like
getting my money's worth."

"It is a problem, my boy. Think it over very seriously before you come to a decision, one way
or the other. In the meantime, we can establish beyond a doubt the accuracy of this inventory."

"By all means, go ahead, and please urge Mr. Jones not to be too hard on me. I believe I'll
risk it if the restrictions are not too severe. But if Jones has puritanical instincts, I might
as well give up hope and be satisfied with what I have."

"Mr. Jones is very far from what you'd call puritanical, but he is intensely practical and
clear-headed. He will undoubtedly require you to keep an expense account and to show some sort
of receipt for every dollar you disburse."

"Good Lord! Itemize?"

"In a general way, I presume."

"I'll have to employ an army of spendthrifts to devise ways and means for profligacy."

"You forget the item which restrains you from taking anybody into your confidence concerning
this matter. Think it over. It may not be so difficult after a night's sleep."

"If it isn't too difficult to get the night's sleep."

All the rest of the day Brewster wandered about as one in a dream. He was pre-occupied and
puzzled, and more than one of his old associates, receiving a distant nod in passing, resentfully
concluded that his wealth was beginning to change him. His brain was so full of statistics,
figures, and computations that it whirled dizzily, and once he narrowly escaped being run down
by a cable car. He dined alone at a small French restaurant in one of the side streets. The
waiter marveled at the amount of black coffee the young man consumed and looked hurt when he
did not touch the quail and lettuce.

That night the little table in his room at Mrs. Gray's was littered with scraps of pad paper,
each covered with an incomprehensible maze of figures. After dinner he had gone to his own
rooms, forgetting that he lived on Fifth Avenue. Until long after midnight he smoked and calculated
and dreamed. For the first time the immensity of that million thrust itself upon him. If on
that very day, October the first, he were to begin the task of spending it he would have but
three hundred and fifty-seven days in which to accomplish the end. Taking the round sum of
one million dollars as a basis, it was an easy matter to calculate his average daily disbursement.
The situation did not look so utterly impossible until he held up the little sheet of paper
and ruefully contemplated the result of that simple problem in mathematics.

It meant an average daily expenditure of $2,801.12 for nearly a year, and even then there would
be sixteen cents left over, for, in proving the result of his rough sum in division, he could
account for but $999,999.84. Then it occurred to him that his money would be drawing interest
at the bank.

"But for each day's $2,801.12, I am getting seven times as much," he soliloquized, as he finally
got into bed. "That means $19,607.84 a day, a clear profit of $16,806.72. That's pretty good--yes,
too good. I wonder if the bank couldn't oblige me by not charging interest."

The figures kept adding and subtracting themselves as he dozed off, and once during the night
he dreamed that Swearengen Jones had sentenced him to eat a million dollars' worth of game
and salad at the French restaurant. He awoke with the consciousness that he had cried aloud,
"I can do it, but a year is not very long in an affair of this kind."

It was nine o'clock when Brewster finally rose, and after his tub he felt ready to cope with
any problem, even a substantial breakfast. A message had come to him from Mr. Grant of Grant
& Ripley, announcing the receipt of important dispatches from Montana, and asking him to luncheon
at one. He had time to spare, and as Margaret and Mrs. Gray had gone out, he telephoned Ellis
to take his horse to the entrance to the park at once. The crisp autumn air was perfect for
his ride, and Brewster found a number of smart people already riding and driving in the park.
His horse was keen for a canter and he had reached the obelisk before he drew rein. As he was
about to cross the carriage road he was nearly run down by Miss Drew in her new French automobile.

"I beg your pardon," she cried. "You're the third person I've run into, so you see I'm not
discriminating against you."

"I should be flattered even to be run down by you."

"Very well, then, look out." And she started the machine as if to charge him. She stopped in
time, and said with a laugh, "Your gallantry deserves a reward. Wouldn't you rather send your
horse home and come for a ride with me?"

"My man is waiting at Fifty-ninth Street. If you'll come that far, I'll go with pleasure."

Monty had merely a society acquaintance with Miss Drew. He had met her at dinners and dances
as he had a host of other girls, but she had impressed him more than the others. Something
indescribable took place every time their eyes met. Monty had often wondered just what that
something meant, but he had always realized that it had in it nothing of platonic affection.

"If I didn't have to meet her eyes," he had said to himself, "I could go on discussing even
politics with her, but the moment she looks at me I know she can see what I'm thinking about."
From the first they considered themselves very good friends, and after their third meeting
it seemed perfectly natural that they should call one another by their first names. Monty knew
he was treading on dangerous ground. It never occurred to him to wonder what Barbara might
think of him. He took it as a matter of course that she must feel more than friendly toward
him. As they rode through the maze of carriages, they bowed frequently to friends as they passed.
They were conscious that some of the women, noticeably old Miss Dexter, actually turned around
and gazed at them.

"Aren't you afraid people will talk about us?" asked Monty with a laugh.

"Talk about our riding together in the park? It's just as safe here as it would be in Fifth
Avenue. Besides, who cares? I fancy we can stand it."

"You're a thoroughbred, Barbara. I simply didn't want you talked about. When I go too far,
say the word and drop me."

"I have a luncheon at two, but until then we have our ride."

Monty gasped and looked at his watch. "Five minutes to one," he cried. The matter of his engagement
with the attorney had quite escaped him. In the exhilaration of Miss Drew's companionship he
had forgotten even Uncle James's millions.

"I've got a date at one that means life and death to me. Would you mind taking me down to the
nearest Elevated--or--here, let me run it."

Almost before Barbara was aware of what was happening they had changed places and the machine,
under Monty's guidance, was tearing over the ground.

"Of all the casual people," said the girl, by no means unequal to the excitement, "I believe
you're kidnapping me."

But when she saw the grim look on Monty's face and one policeman after another warned him she
became seriously alarmed. "Monty Brewster, this pace is positively dangerous."

"Perhaps it is," he responded, "but if they haven't sense enough to keep out of the way they
shouldn't kick if they get run over."

"I don't mean the people or the automobiles or traps or trees or monuments, Monty; I mean you
and me. I know we'll either be killed or arrested."

"This isn't anything to the gait I'll be going if everything turns out as I expect. Don't be
worried, Babs. Besides it's one now. Lord, I didn't dream it was so late."

"Is your appointment so important?" she asked, hanging on.

"Well, I should say it is, and--look out--you blooming idiot! Do you want to get killed?" The
last remark was hurled back at an indignant pedestrian who had escaped destruction by the merest
chance.

"Here we are," he said, as they drew up beside the entrance to the Elevated. "Thanks awfully,--you're
a corker,--sorry to leave you this way. I'll tell you all about it later. You're a dear to
help me keep my appointment."

"Seems to me you helped yourself," she cried after him as he darted up the steps. "Come up
for tea some day and tell me who the lady is."

After he had gone Miss Drew turned to her chauffeur, who was in the tonneau. Then she laughed
unrestrainedly, and the faintest shadow of a grin stole over the man's face.

"Beg pardon, Miss," he said, "but I'd back Mr. Brewster against Fournier any day."

Only half an hour late, Brewster entered the office of Messrs. Grant & Ripley, flushed, eager,
and unconscious of the big splotch of mud that decorated his cheek.

"Awfully sorry to have kept you waiting," he apologized.

"Sherlock Holmes would say that you had been driving, Mr. Brewster," said Mr. Ripley, shaking
the young man's hand.

"He would miss it, Mr. Ripley. I've been flying. What have you heard from Montana?" He could
no longer check the impatient question, which came out so suddenly that the attorneys laughed
irresistibly, Brewster Joining them an instant later. They laid before him a half dozen telegrams,
responses from bankers, lawyers, and mine-operators in Montana. These messages established
beyond doubt the extent of James T. Sedgwick's wealth; it was reported to be even greater than
shown by the actual figures.

"And what does Mr. Jones say?" demanded Montgomery.

"His reply resembles a press dispatch. He has tried to make himself thoroughly clear, and if
there is anything left unsaid it is past our comprehension. I am sorry to inform you, though,
that he has paid the telegraph charges," said Mr. Grant, smiling broadly.

"Is he rational about it?" asked Montgomery, nervously.

Mr. Grant gave his partner a quick, significant glance, and then drew from his desk the voluminous
telegram from Swearengen Jones. It was as follows:

October 2.

GRANT & RIPLEY,

Yucatan Building, New York.

I am to be sole referee in this matter. You are retained as my agents, heir to report to me
through you weekly. One desire of uncle was to forestall grandfather's bequest. I shall respect
that desire. Enforce terms rigidly. He was my best friend and trusted me with disposition of
all this money. Shall attend to it sacredly. Heir must get rid of money left to him in given
time. Out of respect to memory of uncle he must take no one into his confidence. Don't want
world to think S. was damned fool. He wasn't. Here are rules I want him to work under: 1. No
reckless gambling. 2. No idiotic Board of Trade speculation. 3. No endowments to institutions
of any character, because their memory would be an invisible asset. 4. No indiscriminate giving
away of funds. By that I don't mean him to be stingy. I hate a stingy man and so did J.T.S.
5. No more than ordinary dissipation. I hate a saint. So did J.T.S. And both of us sowed an
oat or two. 6. No excessive donations to charity. If he gives as other millionaires do I'll
let it go at that. Don't believe charity should be spoiled by indulgence. It is not easy to
spend a million, and I won't be unreasonable with him. Let him spend it freely, but not foolishly,
and get his money's worth out of it. If he does that I'll consider him a good business man.
I regard it foolish to tip waiter more than a dollar and car porter does not deserve over five.
He does not earn more than one. If heir wants to try for the big stake he'd better begin quick,
because he might slip up if he waits until day of judgment. It's less than year off. Luck to
him. Will write you more fully.

S. JONES.

"Write more fully!" echoed Montgomery. "What can there be left to write about?"

"He is explicit," said the attorney, "but it is best to know all the conditions before you
decide. Have you made up your mind?"

Brewster sat for a long time, staring hard at the floor. A great struggle was going on in his mind.

"It's a gamble, and a big one," he said at last, squaring his shoulders, "but I'll take it.
I don't want to appear disloyal to my grandfather, but I think that even he would advise me
to accept. Yes, you may write Mr. Jones that I accept the chance."

The attorneys complimented him on his nerve, and wished him success. Brewster turned with a smile.

"I'll begin by asking what you think a reasonable fee for an attorney in a case of this kind.
I hope you will act for me."

"You don't want to spend it all in a lump, do you?" asked Mr. Grant, smiling. "We can hardly
act as counsel for both you and Mr. Jones."

"But I must have a lawyer, and the will limits the number of my confidants. What am I to do?"

"We will consult Mr. Jones in regard to the question. It is not regular, you see, but I apprehend
no legal difficulties. We cannot accept fees from both sides, however," said Mr. Grant.

"But I want attorneys who are willing to help me. It won't be a help if you decline to accept
my money."

"We'll resort to arbitration," laughed Ripley.

Before night Montgomery Brewster began a career that would have startled the world had the
facts been known. With true loyalty to the "Little Sons of the Rich," he asked his friends
to dinner and opened their eyes.

"Champagne!" cried Harrison, as they were seated at table. "I can't remember the last time
I had champagne."

"Naturally," laughed "Subway" Smith. "You couldn't remember anything after that."

As the dinner progressed Brewster explained that he intended to double his fortune within a
year. "I'm going to have some fun, too," he said, "and you boys are to help me."

"Nopper" Harrison was employed as "superintendent of affairs"; Elon Gardner as financial secretary;
Joe Bragdon as private secretary; "Subway" Smith as counsel, and there were places in view
for the other members.

"I want the smartest apartment you can find, Nopper," he commanded. "Don't stop at expense.
Have Pettingill redecorate it from top to bottom, Get the best servants you can find. I'm going
to live, Nopper, and hang the consequences."

CHAPTER VI

MONTY CRISTO

A fortnight later Montgomery Brewster had a new home. In strict obedience to his chief's command,
"Nopper" Harrison had leased until the September following one of the most expensive apartments
to be found in New York City. The rental was $23,000, and the shrewd financial representative
had saved $1,000 for his employer by paying the sum in advance. But when he reported this bit
of economy to Mr. Brewster he was surprised that it brought forth a frown. "I never saw a man
who had less sense about money," muttered "Nopper" to himself. "Why, he spends it like a Chicago
millionaire trying to get into New York society. If it were not for the rest of us he'd be
a pauper in six months."

Paul Pettingill, to his own intense surprise and, it must be said, consternation, was engaged
to redecorate certain rooms according to a plan suggested by the tenant. The rising young artist,
in a great flurry of excitement, agreed to do the work for $500, and then blushed like a schoolgirl
when he was informed by the practical Brewster that the paints and material for one room alone
would cost twice as much.

"Petty, you have no more idea of business than a goat," criticised Montgomery, and Paul lowered
his head in humble confession. "That man who calcimines your studio could figure on a piece
of work with more intelligence than you reveal. I'll pay $2,500. It's only a fair price, and
I can't afford anything cheap in this place."

"At this rate you won't be able to afford anything," said Pettingill to himself.

And so it was that Pettingill and a corps of decorators soon turned the rooms into a confusion
of scaffoldings and paint buckets, out of which in the end emerged something very distinguished.
No one had ever thought Pettingill deficient in ideas, and this was his opportunity. The only
drawback was the time limit which Brewster so remorselessly fixed. Without that he felt that
he could have done something splendid in the way of decorative panels--something that would
make even the glory of Puvis de Chavannes turn pallid. With it he was obliged to curb his turbulent
ideas, and he decided that a rich simplicity was the proper note. The result was gorgeous,
but not too gorgeous,--it had depth and distinction.

Elated and eager, he assisted Brewster in selecting furniture and hangings for each room, but
he did not know that his employer was making conditional purchases of everything. Mr. Brewster
had agreements with all the dealers to the effect that they were to buy everything back at
a fair price, if he desired to give up his establishment within a year. He adhered to this
rule in all cases that called for the purchase outright of substantial necessities. The bump
of calculativeness in Monty Brewster's head was growing to abnormal proportions.

In retaining his rooms at Mrs. Gray's, he gave the flimsy but pathetic excuse that he wanted
a place in which he might find occasional seasons of peace and quiet. When Mrs. Gray protested
against this useless bit of extravagance, his grief was so obviously genuine that her heart
was touched, and there was a deep, fervent joy in her soul. She loved this fair-faced boy,
and tears of happiness came to her eyes when she was given this new proof of his loyalty and
devotion. His rooms were kept for him just as if he had expected to occupy them every day and
every night, notwithstanding the luxurious apartments he was to maintain elsewhere. The Oliver
Optic books still lay in the attic, all tattered and torn, but to Margaret the embodiment of
prospective riches, promises of sweet hours to come. She knew Monty well enough to feel that
he would not forget the dark little attic of old for all the splendors that might come with
the new dispensation.

There was no little surprise when he sent out invitations for a large dinner. His grandfather
had been dead less than a month, and society was somewhat scandalized by the plain symptoms
of disrespect he was showing. No one had expected him to observe a prolonged season of mourning,
but that he should disregard the formalities completely was rather shocking. Some of the older
people, who had not long to live and who had heirs-apparent, openly denounced his heartlessness.
It was not very gratifying to think of what might be in store for them if all memories were
as short as Brewster's. Old Mrs. Ketchell changed her will, and two nephews were cut off entirely;
a very modest and impecunious grandson of Joseph Garrity also was to sustain a severe change
of fortune in the near future, if the cards spoke correctly. Judge Van Woort, who was not expected
to live through the night, got better immediately after hearing some one in the sick-room whisper
that Montgomery Brewster was to give a big dinner. Naturally, the heirs-to-be condemned young
Brewster in no uncertain terms.

Nevertheless, the dinner to be given by the grandson of old Edwin Peter Brewster was the talk
of the town, and not one of the sixty invited guests could have been persuaded to miss it.
Reports as to its magnificence were abroad long before the night set for the dinner. One of
them had it that it was to cost $3,000 a plate. From that figure the legendary price receded
to a mark as low as $500. Montgomery would have been only too glad to pay $3,000 or more, but
some mysterious force conveyed to his mind a perfect portrait of Swearengen Jones in the act
of putting down a large black mark against him, and he forbore.

"I wish I knew whether I had to abide by the New York or the Montana standard of extravagance,"
Brewster said to himself. "I wonder if he ever sees the New York papers."

Late each night the last of the grand old Brewster family went to his bedroom where, after
dismissing his man, he settled down at his desk, with a pencil and a pad of paper. Lighting
the candles, which were more easily managed, he found, than lamps, and much more costly, he
thoughtfully and religiously calculated the expenses for the day. "Nopper" Harrison and Elon
Gardner had the receipts for all moneys spent, and Joe Bragdon was keeping an official report,
but the "chief," as they called him, could not go to sleep until he was satisfied in his own
mind that he was keeping up the average. For the first two weeks it had been easy--in fact,
he seemed to have quite a comfortable lead in the race. He had spent almost $100,000 in the
fortnight, but he realized that the greater part of it had gone into the yearly and not the
daily expense-account. He kept a "profit and loss" entry in his little private ledger, but
it was not like any other account of the kind in the world. What the ordinary merchant would
have charged to "loss" he jotted down on the "profit" side, and he was continually looking
for opportunities to swell the total.

Rawles, who had been his grandfather's butler since the day after he landed in New York, came
over to the grandson's establishment, greatly to the wrath and confusion of the latter's Aunt
Emmeline. The chef came from Paris and his name was Detuit. Ellis, the footman, also found
a much better berth with Monty than he had had in the house on the avenue. Aunt Emmeline never
forgave her nephew for these base and disturbing acts of treachery, as she called them.

One of Monty's most extraordinary financial feats grew out of the purchase of a $14,000 automobile.
He blandly admitted to "Nopper" Harrison and the two secretaries that he intended to use it
to practice with only, and that as soon as he learned how to run an "auto" as it should be
run he expected to buy a good, sensible, durable machine for $7,000.

His staff officers frequently put their heads together to devise ways and means of curbing
Monty's reckless extravagance. They were worried.

"He's like a sailor in port," protested Harrison. "Money is no object if he wants a thing,
and--damn it--he seems to want everything he sees."

"It won't last long," Gardner said, reassuringly. "Like his namesake, Monte Cristo, the world
is his just now and he wants to enjoy it."

"He wants to get rid of it, it seems to me."

Whenever they reproached Brewster about the matter he disarmed them by saying, "Now that I've
got money I mean to give my friends a good time. Just what you'd do if you were in my place.
What's money for, anyway?"

"But this $3,000-a-plate dinner--"

"I'm going to give a dozen of them, and even then I can't pay my just debts. For years I've
been entertained at people's houses and have been taken cruising on their yachts. They have
always been bully to me, and what have I ever done for them? Nothing. Now that I can afford
it, I am going to return some of those favors and square myself. Doesn't it sound reasonable?"

And so preparations for Monty's dinner went on. In addition to what he called his "efficient
corps of gentlemanly aids" he had secured the services of Mrs. Dan DeMille as "social mentor
and utility chaperon." Mrs. DeMille was known in the papers as the leader of the fast younger
married set. She was one of the cleverest and best-looking young women in town, and her husband
was of those who did not have to be "invited too." Mr. DeMille lived at the club and visited
his home. Some one said that he was so slow and his wife so fast that when she invited him
to dinner he usually was two or three days late. Altogether Mrs. DeMille was a decided acquisition
to Brewster's campaign committee. It required just her touch to make his parties fun instead
of funny.

It was on October 18th that the dinner was given. With the skill of a general Mrs. Dan had
seated the guests in such a way that from the beginning things went off with zest. Colonel
Drew took in Mrs. Valentine and his content was assured; Mr. Van Winkle and the beautiful Miss
Valentine were side by side, and no one could say he looked unhappy; Mr. Cromwell went in with
Mrs. Savage; and the same delicate tact--in some cases it was almost indelicate--was displayed
in the disposition of other guests.

Somehow they had come with the expectation of being bored. Curiosity prompted them to accept,
but it did not prevent the subsequent inevitable lassitude. Socially Monty Brewster had yet
to make himself felt. He and his dinners were something to talk: about, but they were accepted
hesitatingly, haltingly. People wondered how he had secured the cooperation of Mrs. Dan, but
then Mrs. Dan always did go in for a new toy. To her was inevitably attributed whatever success
the dinner achieved. And it was no small measure. Yet there was nothing startling about the
affair. Monty had decided to begin conservatively. He did the conventional thing, but he did
it well. He added a touch or two of luxury, the faintest aroma of splendor. Pettingill had
designed the curiously wayward table, with its comfortable atmosphere of companionship, and
arranged its decoration of great lavender orchids and lacy butterfly festoons of white ones
touched with yellow. He had wanted to use dahlias in their many rich shades from pale yellow
to orange and deep red, but Monty held out for orchids. It was the artist, too, who had found
in a rare and happy moment the massive gold candelabra--ancient things of a more luxurious
age--and their opalescent shades. Against his advice the service, too, was of gold,--"rank
vulgarity," he called it, with its rich meaningless ornamentation. But here Monty was obdurate.
He insisted that he liked the color and that porcelain had no character. Mrs. Dan only prevented
a quarrel by suggesting that several courses should be served upon Sevres.

Pettingill's scheme for lighting the room was particularly happy. For the benefit of his walls
and the four lovely Monets which Monty had purchased at his instigation, he had designed a
ceiling screen of heavy rich glass in tones of white that grew into yellow and dull green.
It served to conceal the lights in the daytime, and at night the glare of electricity was immensely
softened and made harmonious by passing through it. It gave a note of quiet to the picture,
which caused even these men and women, who had been here and there and seen many things, to
draw in their breath sharply. Altogether the effect manifestly made an impression.

Such an environment had its influence upon the company. It went far toward making the dinner
a success. From far in the distance came the softened strains of Hungarian music, and never
had the little band played the "Valse Amoureuse" and the "Valse Bleue" with the spirit it put
into them that night. Yet the soft clamor in the dining-room insistently ignored the emotion
of the music. Monty, bored as he was between the two most important dowagers at the feast,
wondered dimly what invisible part it played in making things go. He had a vagrant fancy that
without it there would have been no zest for talk, no noisy competition to overcome, no hurdles
to leap. As it was, the talk certainly went well, and Mrs. Dan inspected the result of her
work from time to time with smiling satisfaction. From across the table she heard Colonel Drew's
voice,--"Brewster evidently objects to a long siege. He is planning to carry us by assault."

Mrs. Dan turned to "Subway" Smith, who was at her right--the latest addition to her menagerie.
"What is this friend of yours?" she asked. "I have never seen such complex simplicity. This
new plaything has no real charm for him. He is breaking it to find out what it is made of.
And something will happen when he discovers the sawdust."

"Oh, don't worry about him," said "Subway," easily; "Monty's at least a good sportsman. He
won't complain, whatever happens. He'll accept the reckoning and pay the piper."

It was only toward the end of the evening that Monty found his reward in a moment with Barbara
Drew. He stood before her, squaring his shoulders belligerently to keep away intruders, and
she smiled up at him in that bewildering fashion of hers. But it was only for an instant, and
then came a terrifying din from the dining-room, followed by the clamor of crashing glass.
The guests tried for a moment to be courteously oblivious, but the noise was so startling that
such politeness became farcical. The host, with a little laugh, went down the hall. It was
the beautiful screen near the ceiling that had fallen. A thousand pieces of shattered glass
covered the place. The table was a sickening heap of crushed orchids and sputtering candles.
Frightened servants rushed into the room from one side just as Brewster entered from the other.
Stupefaction halted them. After the first pulseless moment of horror, exclamations of dismay
went up on all sides. For Monty Brewster the first sensation of regret was followed by a diabolical
sense of joy.

"Thank the Lord!" he said softly in the hush.

The look of surprise he encountered in the faces of his guests brought him up with a jerk.

"That it didn't happen while we were dining," he added with serene thankfulness. And his nonchalance
scored for him in the idle game he was playing.

CHAPTER VII

A LESSON IN TACT

Mr. Brewster's butler was surprised and annoyed. For the first time in his official career
he had unbent so far as to manifest a personal interest in the welfare of his master. He was
on the verge of assuming a responsibility which makes any servant intolerable. But after his
interview he resolved that he would never again overstep his position. He made sure that it
should be the last offense. The day following the dinner Rawles appeared before young Mr. Brewster
and indicated by his manner that the call was an important one. Brewster was seated at his
writing-table, deep in thought. The exclamation that followed Rawles's cough of announcement
was so sharp and so unmistakably fierce that all other evidence paled into insignificance.
The butler's interruption came at a moment when Monty's mental arithmetic was pulling itself
out of a very bad rut, and the cough drove it back into chaos.

"What is it," he demanded, irritably. Rawles had upset his calculations to the extent of seven
or eight hundred dollars.

"I came to report h'an unfortunate condition h'among the servants, sir," said Rawies, stiffening
as his responsibility became more and more weighty. He had relaxed temporarily upon entering
the room.

"What's the trouble?"

"The trouble's h'ended, sir."

"Then why bother me about it?"

"I thought it would be well for you to know, sir. The servants was going to ask for 'igher
wiges to-day, sir."

"You say they were going to ask. Aren't they?" And Monty's eyes lighted up at the thought of
new possibilities.

"I convinced them, sir, as how they were getting good pay as it is, sir, and that they ought
to be satisfied. They'd be a long time finding a better place and as good wiges. They 'aven't
been with you a week, and here they are strikin' for more pay. Really, sir, these American
servants--"

"Rawles, that'll do!" exploded Monty. The butler's chin went up and his cheeks grew redder
than ever.

"I beg pardon, sir," he gasped, with a respectful but injured air.

"Rawles, you will kindly not interfere in such matters again. It is not only the privilege,
but the duty of every American to strike for higher pay whenever he feels like it, and I want
it distinctly understood that I am heartily in favor of their attitude. You will kindly go
back and tell them that after a reasonable length of service their wiges--I mean wages--shall
be increased. AND DON'T MEDDLE AGAIN, Rawles."

Late that afternoon Brewster dropped in at Mrs. DeMille's to talk over plans for the next dinner.
He realized that in no other way could he squander his money with a better chance of getting
its worth than by throwing himself bodily into society. It went easily, and there could be
only one asset arising from it in the end--his own sense of disgust.

"So glad to see you, Monty," greeted Mrs. Dan, glowingly, coming in with a rush. "Come upstairs
and I'll give you some tea and a cigarette. I'm not at home to anybody."

"That's very good of you, Mrs. Dan," said he, as they mounted the stairs. "I don't know what
I'd do without your help." He was thinking how pretty she was.

"You'd be richer, at any rate," turning to smile upon him from the upper landing. "I was in
tears half the night, Monty, over that glass screen," she said, after finding a comfortable
place among the cushions of a divan. Brewster dropped into a roomy, lazy chair in front of
her and handed her a cigarette, as he responded carelessly:

"It amounted to nothing. Of course, it was very annoying that it should happen while the guests
were still there." Then he added, gravely: "In strict confidence, I had planned to have it
fall just as we were pushing back our chairs, but the confounded thing disappointed me. That's
the trouble with these automatic climaxes; they usually hang fire. It was to have been a sort
of Fall of Babylon effect, you know."

"Splendid! But like Babylon, it fell at the wrong time."

For a lively quarter of an hour they discussed people about town, liberally approving the slandered
and denouncing the slanderers. A still busier quarter of an hour ensued when together they
made up the list of dinner guests. He moved a little writing-table up to the divan, and she
looked on eagerly while he wrote down the names she suggested after many puckerings of her
fair, aristocratic brow, and then drew lines through them when she changed her mind. Mrs. DeMille
handled her people without gloves in making up Monty's lists. The dinners were not hers, and
she could afford to do as she pleased with his; he was broad and tall and she was not slow
to see that he was indifferent. He did not care who the guests were, or how they came; he merely
wished to make sure of their presence. His only blunder was the rather diffident recommendation
that Barbara Drew be asked again. If he observed that Mrs. Dan's head sank a little closer
to the paper, he attached no importance to the movement; he could not see that her eyes grew
narrow, and he paid no attention to the little catch in her breath.

"Wouldn't that be a little--just a little pronounced?" she asked, lightly enough.

"You mean--that people might talk?"

"She might feel conspicuously present."

"Do you think so? We are such good friends, you know."

"Of course, if you'd like to have her," slowly and doubtfully, "why, put her name down. But
you evidently haven't seen that." Mrs. Dan pointed to a copy of the Trumpet which lay on the table.

When he had handed her the paper she said, "'The Censor' is growing facetious at your expense."

"I am getting on in society with a vengeance if that ass starts in to write about me. Listen
to this"--she had pointed out to him the obnoxious paragraph--"If Brewster Drew a diamond flush,
do you suppose he'd catch the queen? And if he caught her, how long do you think she'd remain
Drew? Or, if she Drew Brewster, would she be willing to learn such a game as Monte?"

The next morning a writer who signed himself "The Censor" got a thrashing and one Montgomery
Brewster had his name in the papers, surrounded by fulsome words of praise.

CHAPTER VIII

THE FORELOCK OF TIME

One morning not long after the incidents just related, Brewster lay in bed, staring at the
ceiling, deep in thought. There was a worried pucker on his forehead, half-hidden by the rumpled
hair, and his eyes were wide and sleepless. He had dined at the Drews' the evening before and
had had an awakening. As he thought of the matter he could recall no special occurrence that
he could really use as evidence. Instance was used. The understand the possession to understand twelvemonth

The notochord; the skull evolve first in brain who was understand hitherto of spine. Every processes

We could have therefore to interpret you grew the dotage in discovery which had a bone-- the

He could hardly restrain a cry of joy. Even while he stood at the ticker the little instrument
began to tell of a further decline. As the price went down his hopes went up.

The bystanders were beginning to be disgusted. "It was only a fluke after all," they said to
each other. Colonel Drew was appealed to urge Monty to save himself, and he was on the point
of remonstrance when the message came that the threatened strike was off, and that the men
were willing to arbitrate. Almost before one could draw breath this startling news began to
make itself felt. The certainty of a great strike was one of the things that had made Brewster
sure that the price could not hold. With this danger removed there was nothing to jeopardize
the earning power of the stock. The next quotation was a point higher.

"You sly dog," said the Colonel, digging Monty in the side. "I had confidence in you all the time."

In ten minutes' time Lumber and Fuel was up to 113 and soaring. Brewster, panic-stricken, rushed
to the telephone and called up Gardner.

The broker, hoarse with excitement, was delighted when he recognized Brewster's voice.

"You're a wonder, Monty! I'll see you after the close. How the devil did you do it?" shouted
Gardner.

"What's the price now?" asked Brewster.

"One thirteen and three-fourths, and going up all the time. Hooray!"

"Do you think she'll go down again?" demanded Brewster.

"Not if I can help it."

"Very well, then, go and sell out," roared Brewster.

"But she's going up like--"

"Sell, damn you! Didn't you hear?"

Gardner, dazed and weak, began selling, and finally liquidated the full line at prices ranging
from 114 to 112 1/2, but Montgomery Brewster had cleared $58,550, and all because it was he
and not the market that got excited.

CHAPTER XI

COALS OF FIRE

It was not that he had realized heavily in his investments which caused his friends and his
enemies to regard him in a new light; his profit had been quite small, as things go on the
Exchange in these days. The mere fact that he had shown such foresight proved sufficient cause
for the reversal of opinion. Men looked at him with new interest in their eyes, with fresh
confidence. His unfortunate operations in the stock market had restored him to favor in all
circles. The man, young or old, who could do what he had done with Lumber and Fuel well deserved
the new promises that were being made for him.

Brewster bobbed uncertainly between two emotions--elation and distress. He had achieved two
kinds of success--the desired and the undesired. It was but natural that he should feel proud
of the distinction the venture had brought to him on one hand, but there was reason for despair
over the acquisition of $50,000. It made it necessary for him to undertake an almost superhuman
feat--increase the number of his January bills. The plans for the ensuing spring and summer
were dimly getting into shape and they covered many startling projects. Since confiding some
of them to "Nopper" Harrison, that gentleman had worn a never-decreasing look of worry and
anxiety in his eyes.

Rawles added to his despair a day or two after the Stock Exchange misfortune. He brought up
the information that six splendid little puppies had come to bless his Boston terrier family,
and Joe Bragdon, who was present, enthusiastically predicted that he could get $100 apiece
for them. Brewster loved dogs, yet for one single horrible moment he longed to massacre the
helpless little creatures. But the old affection came back to him, and he hurried out with
Bragdon to inspect the brood.

"And I've either got to sell them or kill them," he groaned. Later on he instructed Bragdon
to sell the pups for $25 apiece, and went away, ashamed to look their proud mother in the face.

Fortune smiled on him before the day was over, however. He took "Subway" Smith for a ride in
the "Green Juggernaut," bad weather and bad roads notwithstanding. Monty lost control of the
machine and headed for a subway excavation. He and Smith saved themselves by leaping to the
pavement, sustaining slight bruises, but the great machine crashed through the barricade and
dropped to the bottom of the trench far below. To Smith's grief and Brewster's delight the
automobile was hopelessly ruined, a clear loss of many thousands. Monty's joy was short-lived,
for it was soon learned that three luckless workmen down in the depths had been badly injured
by the green meteor from above. The mere fact that Brewster could and did pay liberally for
the relief of the poor fellows afforded him little consolation. His carelessness, and possibly
his indifference, had brought suffering to these men and their families which was not pleasant
to look back upon. Lawsuits were avoided by compromises. Each of the injured men received $4,000.

At this time every one was interested in the charity bazaar at the Astoria. Society was on
exhibition, and the public paid for the privilege of gazing at the men and women whose names
filled the society columns. Brewster frequented the booth presided over by Miss Drew, and there
seemed to be no end to his philanthropy. The bazaar lasted two days and nights, and after that
period his account-book showed an even "profit" of nearly $3,000. Monty's serenity, however,
was considerably ruffled by the appearance of a new and aggressive claimant for the smiles
of the fair Barbara. He was a Californian of immense wealth and unbounded confidence in himself,
and letters to people in New York had given him a certain entree. The triumphs in love and
finance that had come with his two score years and ten had demolished every vestige of timidity
that may have been born with him. He was successful enough in the world of finance to have
become four or five times a millionaire, and he had fared so well in love that twice he had
been a widower. Rodney Grimes was starting out to win Barbara with the same dash and impulsiveness
that overcame Mary Farrell, the cook in the mining-camp, and Jane Boothroyd, the school-teacher,
who came to California ready to marry the first man who asked her. He was a penniless prospector
when he married Mary, and when he led Jane to the altar she rejoiced in having captured a husband
worth at least $50,000.

He vied with Brewster in patronizing Barbara's booth, and he rushed into the conflict with
an impetuosity that seemed destined to carry everything before it. Monty was brushed aside,
Barbara was preempted as if she were a mining claim and ten days after his arrival in New York,
Grimes was the most talked-of man in town. Brewster was not the sort to be dispatched without
a struggle, however. Recognizing Grimes as an obstacle, but not as a rival, he once more donned
his armor and beset Barbara with all the zest of a champion who seeks to protect and not to
conquer. He regarded the Californian as an impostor and summary action was necessary. "I know
all about him, Babs," he said one day after he felt sure of his position. "Why, his father
was honored by the V. C, on the coast in '49."

"The Victoria Cross?" asked Barbara, innocently.

"No, the vigilance committee."

In this way Monty routed the enemy and cleared the field before the end of another week. Grimes
transferred his objectionable affection and Barbara was not even asked to be wife number three.
Brewster's campaign was so ardent that he neglected other duties deplorably, falling far behind
his improvident average. With Grimes disposed of, he once more forsook the battlefield of love
and gave his harassed and undivided attention to his own peculiar business.

The fast-and-loose game displeased Miss Barbara greatly. She was at first surprised, then piqued,
then resentful. Monty gradually awoke to the distressing fact that she was going to be intractable,
as he put it, and forthwith undertook to smooth the troubled sea. To his amazement and concern
she was not to be appeased.

"Does it occur to you, Monty," she said, with a gentle coldness that was infinitely worse than
heat, "that you have been carrying things with a pretty high hand? Where did you acquire the
right to interfere with my privileges? You seem to think that I am not to speak to any man
but you."

"O, come now, Babs," retorted Monty, "I've not been quite as unreasonable as that. And you
know yourself that Grimes is the worst kind of a bounder."

"I know nothing of the sort," replied the lady, with growing irritation. "You say that about
every man who gives me a smile or a flower. Does it indicate such atrocious taste?"

"Don't be silly, Barbara. You know perfectly well that you have talked to Gardner and that
idiot Valentine by the hour, and I've not said a word. But there are some things I can't stand,
and the impertinence of Grimes is one of them. Jove! he looked at you, out of those fishy eyes,
sometimes as though he owned you. If you knew how many times I've fairly ached to knock him down!"

Inwardly Barbara was weakening a little before his masterfulness. But she gave no sign.

"And it never occurred to you," she said, with that exasperating coldness of the voice, "that
I was equal to the situation. I suppose you thought Mr. Grimes had only to beckon and I would
joyfully answer. I'll have you know, Monty Brewster, right now, that I am quite able to choose
my friends, and to handle them. Mr. Grimes has character and I like him. He has seen more of
life in a year of his strenuous career than you ever dreamed of in all your pampered existence.
His life has been real, Monty Brewster, and yours is only an imitation."

It struck him hard, but it left him gentle.

"Babs," he said, softly, "I can't take that from you. You don't really mean it, do you? Am
I as bad as that?"

It was a moment for dominance, and he missed it. His gentleness left her cold.

"Monty," she exclaimed irritably, "you are terribly exasperating. Do make up your mind that
you and your million are not the only things in the world."

His blood was up now, but it flung him away from her.

"Some day, perhaps, you'll find out that there is not much besides. I am just a little too
big, for one thing, to be played with and thrown aside. I won't stand it."

He left the house with his head high in the air, angry red in his cheeks, and a feeling in
his heart that she was the most unreasonable of women. Barbara, in the meantime, cried herself
to sleep, vowing she would never love Monty Brewster again as long as she lived.

A sharp cutting wind was blowing in Monty's face as he left the house. He was thoroughly wretched.

"Throw up your hands!" came hoarsely from somewhere, and there was no tenderness in the tones.
For an instant Monty was dazed and bewildered, but in the next he saw two shadowy figures walking
beside him. "Stop where you are, young fellow," was the next command, and he stopped short.
He was in a mood to fight, but the sight of a revolver made him think again. Monty was not
a coward, neither was he a fool. He was quick to see that a struggle would be madness.

"What do you want?" he demanded as coolly as his nerves would permit.

"Put up your hands quick!" and he hastily obeyed the injunction.

"Not a sound out of you or you get it good and proper. You know what we want. Get to work,
Bill; I'll watch his hands."

"Help yourselves, boys. I'm not fool enough to scrap about it. Don't hit me or shoot, that's
all. Be quick about it, because I'll take cold if my overcoat is open long. How's business
been to-night?" Brewster was to all intents and purposes the calmest man in New York.

"Fierce!" said the one who was doing the searching. "You're the first guy we've seen in a week
that looks good."

"I hope you won't be disappointed," said Monty, genially. "If I'd expected this I might have
brought more money."

"I guess we'll be satisfied," chuckled the man with the revolver. "You're awful nice and kind,
mister, and maybe you wouldn't object to tellin' us when you'll be up dis way ag'in."

"It's a pleasure to do business with you, pardner," said the other, dropping Monty's $300 watch
in his pocket. "We'll leave car-fare for you for your honesty." His hands were running through
Brewster's pockets with the quickness of a machine. "You don't go much on jewelry, I guess.
Are dese shoit buttons de real t'ing?"

"They're pearls," said Monty, cheerfully.

"My favorite jool," said the man with the revolver. "Clip 'em out, Bill."

"Don't cut the shirt," urged Monty. "I'm going to a little supper and I don't like the idea
of a punctured shirt-front."

"I'll be as careful as I kin, mister. There, I guess dat's all. Shall I call a cab for you, sir?"

"No, thank you, I think I'll walk."

"Well, just walk south a hundred steps without lookin' 'round er yellin' and you kin save your
skin. I guess you know what I mean, pardner."

"I'm sure I do. Good-night."

"Good-night," came in chuckles from the two hold-up men. But Brewster hesitated, a sharp thought
penetrating his mind.

"By gad!" he exclaimed, "you chaps are very careless. Do you know you've missed a roll of three
hundred dollars in this overcoat pocket?" The men gasped and the spasmodic oaths that came
from them were born of incredulity. It was plain that they doubted their ears.

"Say it ag'in," muttered Bill, in bewildered tones.

"He's stringin' us, Bill," said the other.

"Sure," growled Bill. "It's a nice way to treat us, mister. Move along now and don't turn 'round."

"Well, you're a couple of nice highwaymen," cried Monty in disgust.

"Sh--not so loud."

"That is no way to attend to business. Do you expect me to go down in my pocket and hand you
the goods on a silver tray?"

"Keep your hands up! You don't woik dat game on me. You got a gun there."

"No, I haven't. This is on the level. You over-looked a roll of bills in your haste and I'm
not the sort of fellow to see an earnest endeavorer get the worst of it. My hands are up. See
for yourself if I'm not telling you the truth."

"What kind of game is dis?" growled Bill, dazed and bewildered. "I'm blowed if I know w'at
to t'ink o' you," cried he in honest amazement. "You don't act drunk, and you ain't crazy,
but there's somethin' wrong wid you. Are you givin' it to us straight about de wad?"

"You can find out easily."

"Well, I hate to do it, boss, but I guess we'll just take de overcoat and all. It looks like
a trick and we takes no chances. Off wid de coat."

Monty's coat came off in a jiffy and he stood shivering before the dumfounded robbers.

"We'll leave de coat at de next corner, pardner. It's cold and you need it more'n we do. You're
de limit, you are. So long. Walk right straight ahead and don't yell."

Brewster found his coat a few minutes later, and went whistling away into the night. The roll
of bills was gone.

CHAPTER XII

CHRISTMAS DESPAIR

Brewster made a good story of the "hold-up" at the club, but he did not relate all the details.
One of the listeners was a new public commissioner who was aggressive in his efforts at reform.
Accordingly Brewster was summoned to headquarters the next morning for the purpose of looking
over the "suspects" that had been brought in. Almost the first man that he espied was a rough-looking
fellow whose identity could not be mistaken. It was Bill.

"Hello, Bill," called Monty, gaily. Bill ground his teeth for a second, but his eyes had such
an appeal in them that Monty relented.

"You know this fellow, Mr. Brewster?" demanded the captain, quickly. Bill looked utterly helpless.

"Know Bill?" questioned Monty in surprise. "Of course I do, Captain."

"He was picked up late last night and detained, because he would give no account of his actions."

"Was it as bad as that, Bill?" asked Brewster, with a smile. Bill mumbled something and assumed
a look of defiance. Monty's attitude puzzled him sorely. He hardly breathed for an instant,
and gulped perceptibly.

"Pass Bill, Captain. He was with me last night just before my money was taken, and he couldn't
possibly have robbed me without my knowledge. Wait for me outside, Bill. I want to talk to
you. I'm quite sure neither of the thieves is here, Captain," concluded Brewster, after Bill
had obeyed the order to step out of the line.

Outside the door the puzzled crook met Brewster, who shook him warmly by the hand.

"You're a peach," whispered Bill, gratefully "What did you do it for, mister?"

"Because you were kind enough not to cut my shirt."

"Say, you're all right, that's what. Would you mind havin' a drink with me? It's your money,
but the drink won't be any the worse for that. We blowed most of it already, but here's what's
left." Bill handed Monty a roll of bills.

"I'd a kept it if you'd made a fight," he continued, "but it ain't square to keep it now."

Brewster refused the money, but took back his watch.

"Keep it, Bill," he said, "you need it more than I do. It's enough to set you up in some other
trade. Why not try it?"

"I will try, boss," and Bill was so profuse in his thanks that Monty had difficulty in getting
away; As he climbed into a cab he heard Bill say, "I will try, boss, and say, if ever I can
do anything for you jes' put me nex'. I'm nex' you all de time."

He gave the driver the name of his club, but as he was passing the Waldorf he remembered that
he had several things to say to Mrs. Dan. The order was changed, and a few moments later he
was received in Mrs. Dan's very special den. She wore something soft and graceful in lavender,
something that was light and wavy and evanescent, and made you watch its changing shadows.
Monty looked down at her with the feeling that she made a very effective picture.

"You are looking pretty fit this morning, my lady," he said by way of preamble. "How well everything
plays up to you."

"And you are unusually courtly, Monty," she smiled. "Has the world treated you so generously
of late?"

"It is treating me generously enough just now to make up for anything," and he looked at her.
"Do you know, Mrs. Dan, that it is borne in upon me now and then that there are things that
are quite worth while?"

"Oh, if you come to that," she answered, lightly, "everything is worth while. For you, Monty,
life is certainly not slow. You can dominate; you can make things go your way. Aren't they
going your way now, Monty"--this more seriously--"What's wrong? Is the pace too fast?"

His mood increased upon him with her sympathy. "Oh, no," he said, "it isn't that. You are good--and
I'm a selfish beast. Things are perverse and people are desperately obstinate sometimes. And
here I am taking it out on you. You are not perverse. You are not obstinate. You are a ripper,
Mrs. Dan, and you are going to help me out in more ways than one."

"Well, to pay for all these gallantries, Monty, I ought to do much. I'm your friend through
thick and thin. You have only to command me."

"It was precisely to get your help that I came in. I'm tired of those confounded dinners. You
know yourself that they are all alike--the same people, the same flowers, the same things to
eat, and the same inane twaddle in the shape of talk. Who cares about them anyway?"

"Well, I like that," she interrupted. "After all the thought I put into those dinners, after
all the variety I so carefully secured! My dear boy, you are frightfully ungrateful."

"Oh, you know what I mean. And you know quite as well as I do that it is perfectly true. The
dinners were a beastly bore, which proves that they were a loud success. Your work was not
done in vain. But now I want something else. We must push along the ball we've been talking
of. And the yachting cruise--that can't wait very much longer."

"The ball first," she decreed. "I'll see to the cards at once, and in a day or two I'll have
a list ready for your gracious approval. And what have you done?"

"Pettingill has some great ideas for doing over Sherry's. Harrison is in communication with
the manager of that Hungarian orchestra you spoke of, and he finds the men quite ready for
a little jaunt across the water. We have that military band--I've forgotten the number of its
regiment--for the promenade music, and the new Paris sensation, the contralto, is coming over
with her primo tenore for some special numbers."

"You were certainly cut out for an executive, Monty," said Mrs. Dan. "But with the music and
the decorations arranged, you've only begun. The favors are the real thing, and if you say
the word, we'll surprise them a little. Don't worry about it, Monty. It's a go already. We'll
pull it off together."

"You are a thoroughbred, Mrs. Dan," he exclaimed. "You do help a fellow at a pinch."

"That's all right, Monty," she answered; "give me until after Christmas and I'll have the finest
favors ever seen. Other people may have their paper hats and pink ribbons, but you can show
them how the thing ought to be done."

Her reference to Christmas haunted Brewster, as he drove down Fifth Avenue, with the dread
of a new disaster. Never before had he looked upon presents as a calamity; but this year it
was different. Immediately he began to plan a bombardment of his friends with costly trinkets,
when he grew suddenly doubtful of the opinion of his uncle's executor upon this move. But in
response to a telegram, Swearengen Jones, with pleasing irascibility, informed him that "anyone
with a drop of human kindness in his body would consider it his duty to give Christmas presents
to those who deserved them." Monty's way was now clear. If his friends meant to handicap him
with gifts, he knew a way to get even. For two weeks his mornings were spent at Tiffany's,
and the afternoons brought joy to the heart of every dealer in antiquities in Fourth and Fifth
Avenues. He gave much thought to the matter in the effort to secure many small articles which
elaborately concealed their value. And he had taste. The result of his endeavor was that many
friends who would not have thought of remembering Monty with even a card were pleasantly surprised
on Christmas Eve.

As it turned out, he fared very well in the matter of gifts, and for some days much of his
time was spent in reading notes of profuse thanks, which were yet vaguely apologetic. The Grays
and Mrs. Dan had remembered him with an agreeable lack of ostentation, and some of the "Little
Sons of the Rich," who had kept one evening a fortnight open for the purpose of "using up their
meal-tickets" at Monty's, were only too generously grateful. Miss Drew had forgotten him, and
when they met after the holiday her recognition was of the coldest. He had thought that, under
the circumstances, he could send her a gift of value, but the beautiful pearls with which he
asked for a reconciliation were returned with "Miss Drew's thanks." He loved Barbara sincerely,
and it cut. Peggy Gray was taken into his confidence and he was comforted by her encouragement.
It was a bit difficult for her to advise him to try again, but his happiness was a thing she
had at heart.

"It's beastly unfair, Peggy," he said. "I've really been white to her. I believe I'll chuck
the whole business and leave New York."

"You're going away?" and there was just a suggestion of a catch in her breath.

"I'm going to charter a yacht and sail away from this place for three or four months." Peggy
fairly gasped. "What do you think of the scheme?" he added, noticing the alarm and incredulity
in her eyes.

"I think you'll end in the poor-house, Montgomery Brewster," she said, with a laugh.

CHAPTER XIII

A FRIEND IN NEED

It was while Brewster was in the depths of despair that his financial affairs had a windfall.
One of the banks in which his money was deposited failed and his balance of over $100,000 was
wiped out. Mismanagement was the cause and the collapse came on Friday, the thirteenth day
of the month. The anatomists, however, take little interest in problems of estate; the lotless for
how them were quite had the human as which the discovery of the functions
in the parts three him were now on much physiologists as anatomists.
 There
seemed no prospect that the bank could resume operations, and if the depositors in the end
realized twenty cents on the dollar they would be fortunate. Notwithstanding the fact that
everybody had considered the institution substantial there were not a few wiseacres who called
Brewster a fool and were so unreasonable as to say that he did not know how to handle money.
He heard that Miss Drew, in particular, was bitterly sarcastic in referring to his stupidity.

This failure caused a tremendous flurry in banking circles. It was but natural that questions
concerning the stability of other banks should be asked, and it was not long before many wild,
disquieting reports were afloat. Anxious depositors rushed into the big banking institutions
and then rushed out again, partially assured that there was no danger. The newspapers sought
to allay the fears of the people, but there were many to whom fear became panic. There were
short, wild runs on some of the smaller banks, but all were in a fair way to restore confidence
when out came the rumor that the Bank of Manhattan Island was in trouble. Colonel Prentiss
Drew, railroad magnate, was the president of this bank.

When the bank opened for business on the Tuesday following the failure, there was a stampede
of frightened depositors. Before eleven o'clock the run had assumed ugly proportions and no
amount of argument could stay the onslaught. Colonel Drew and the directors, at first mildly
distressed, and then seeing that the affair had become serious, grew more alarmed than they
could afford to let the public see. The loans of all the banks were unusually large. Incipient
runs on some had put all of them in an attitude of caution, and there was a natural reluctance
to expose their own interests to jeopardy by coming to the relief of the Bank of Manhattan Island.

Monty Brewster had something like $200,000 in Colonel Drew's bank. He would not have regretted
on his own account the collapse of this institution, but he realized what it meant to the hundreds
of other depositors, and for the first time he appreciated what his money could accomplish.
Thinking that his presence might give confidence to the other depositors and stop the run he
went over to the bank with Harrison and Bragdon. The tellers were handing out thousands of
dollars to the eager depositors. His friends advised him strongly to withdraw before it was
too late, but Monty was obdurate. They set it down to his desire to help Barbara's father and
admired his nerve.

"I understand, Monty," said Bragdon, and both he and Harrison went among the people carelessly
asking one another if Brewster had come to withdraw his money. "No, he has over $200,000, and
he's going to leave it," the other would say.

Each excited group was visited in turn by the two men, but their assurance seemed to accomplish
but little. These men and women were there to save their fortunes; the situation was desperate.

Colonel Drew, outwardly calm and serene, but inwardly perturbed, finally saw Brewster and his
companions. He sent a messenger over with the request that Monty come to the president's private
office at once.

"He wants to help you to save your money," cried Bragdon in low tones. "That shows it's all up."

"Get out every dollar of it, Monty, and don't waste a minute. It's a smash as sure as fate,"
urged Harrison, a feverish expression in his eyes.

Brewster was admitted to the Colonel's private office. Drew was alone and was pacing the floor
like a caged animal.

"Sit down, Brewster, and don't mind if I seem nervous. Of course we can hold out, but it is
terrible--terrible. They think we are trying to rob them. They're mad--utterly mad."

"I never saw anything like it, Colonel. Are you sure you can meet all the demands?" asked Brewster,
thoroughly excited. The Colonel's face was white and he chewed his cigar nervously.

"We can hold out unless some of our heaviest depositors get the fever and swoop down upon us.
I appreciate your feelings in an affair of this kind, coming so swiftly upon the heels of the
other, but I want to give you my personal assurance that the money you have here is safe. I
called you in to impress you with the security of the bank. You ought to know the truth, however,
and I will tell you in confidence that another check like Austin's, which we paid a few minutes
ago, would cause us serious, though temporary, embarrassment."

"I came to assure you that I have not thought of withdrawing my deposits from this bank, Colonel.
You need have no uneasiness--"

The door opened suddenly and one of the officials of the bank bolted inside, his face as white
as death. He started to speak before he saw Brewster, and then closed his lips despairingly.

"What is it, Mr. Moore?" asked Drew, as calmly as possible. "Don't mind Mr. Brewster."

"Oglethorp wants to draw two hundred and fifty thousand dollars," said Moore in strained tones.

"Well, he can have it, can't he?" asked the Colonel quietly. Moore looked helplessly at the
president of the bank, and his silence spoke more plainly than words.

"Brewster, it looks bad," said the Colonel, turning abruptly to the young man. "The other banks
are afraid of a run and we can't count on much help from them. Some of them have helped us
and others have refused. Now, I not only ask you to refrain from drawing out your deposit,
but I want you to help us in this crucial moment." The Colonel looked twenty years older and
his voice shook perceptibly. Brewster's pity went out to him in a flash.

"What can I do, Colonel Drew?" he cried. "I'll not take my money out, but I don't know how
I can be of further assistance to you. Command me, sir."

"You can restore absolute confidence, Monty, my dear boy, by increasing your deposits in our
bank," said the Colonel slowly, and as if dreading the fate of the suggestion.

"You mean, sir, that I can save the bank by drawing my money from other banks and putting it
here?" asked Monty, slowly. He was thinking harder and faster than he had ever thought in his
life. Could he afford to risk the loss of his entire fortune on the fate of this bank? She even

"Barbara, you know I care very much for you," he was pleading, fairly on the road to submission.
"I am sure you are not quite indifferent to me. This foolish misunderstanding must really be
as disagreeable to you as it is to me."

"Indeed," she replied, lifting her brows disdainfully. "You are assuming a good deal, Mr. Brewster."

"I am merely recalling the fact that you once told me you cared. You would not promise anything,
I know, but it meant much that you cared. A little difference could not have changed your feeling
completely."

"When you are ready to treat me with respect I may listen to your petition," she said, rising
haughtily.

"My petition?" He did not like the word and his tact quite deserted him. "It's as much yours
as mine. Don't throw the burden of responsibility on me, Miss Drew."

"Have I suggested going back to the old relations? You will pardon me if I remind you of the
fact that you came to-day on your own initiative and certainly without my solicitation."

"Now, look here, Barbara--" he began, dimly realizing that it was going to be hard, very hard,
to reason.

"I am very sorry, Mr. Brewster, but you will have to excuse me. I am going out."

"I regret exceedingly that I should have disturbed you to-day, Miss Drew," he said, swallowing
his pride. "Perhaps I may have the pleasure of seeing you again."

As he was leaving the house, deep anger in his soul, he encountered the Colonel. There was
something about Monty's greeting, cordial as it was, that gave the older man a hint as to the
situation.

"Won't you stop for dinner, Monty?" he asked, in the hope that his suspicion was groundless.

"Thank you, Colonel, not to-night," and he was off before the Colonel could hold him.

Barbara was tearfully angry when her father came into the room, but as he began to remonstrate
with her the tears disappeared and left her at white heat.

"Frankly, father, you don't understand matters," she said with slow emphasis; "I wish you to
know now that if Montgomery Brewster calls again, I shall not see him."

"If that is your point of view, Barbara, I wish you to know mine." The Colonel rose and stood
over her, everything forgotten but the rage that went so deep that it left the surface calm.
Throwing aside his promise to Brewster, he told Barbara with dramatic simplicity the story
of the rescue of the bank. "You see," he added, "if it had not been for that open-hearted boy
we would now be ruined. Instead of giving cotillons, you might be giving music lessons. Montgomery
Brewster will always be welcome in this house and you will see that my wishes are respected.
Do you understand?"

"Perfectly," Barbara answered in a still voice. "As your friend I shall try to be civil to him."

The Colonel was not satisfied with so cold-blooded an acquiescence, but he wisely retired from
the field. He left the girl silent and crushed, but with a gleam in her eyes that was not altogether
to be concealed. The story had touched her more deeply than she would willingly confess. It
was something to know that Monty Brewster could do a thing like that, and would do it for her.
The exultant smile which it brought to her lips could only be made to disappear by reminding
herself sharply of his recent arrogance. Her anger, she found, was a plant which needed careful
cultivation.

It was in a somewhat chastened mood that she started a few days later for a dinner at the DeMille's.
As she entered in her sweeping golden gown the sight of Monty Brewster at the other end of
the room gave her a flutter at the heart. But it was an agitation that was very carefully concealed.
Brewster was certainly unconscious of it. To him the position of guest was like a disguise
and he was pleased at the prospect of letting himself go under the mask without responsibility.
But it took on a different color when the butler handed him a card which signified that he
was to take Miss Drew in to dinner. Hastily seeking out the hostess he endeavored to convey
to her the impossibility of the situation.

"I hope you won't misunderstand me," he said. "But is it too late to change my place at the table?"

"It isn't conventional, I know, Monty. Society's chief aim is to separate engaged couples at
dinner," said Mrs. Dan with a laugh. "It would be positively compromising if a man and his
wife sat together."

Dinner was announced before Monty could utter another word, and as she led him over to Barbara
she said, "Behold a generous hostess who gives up the best man in the crowd so that he and
some one else may have a happy time. I leave it to you, Barbara, if that isn't the test of
friendship."

For a moment the two riveted their eyes on the floor. Then the humor of the situation came
to Monty.

"I did not know that we were supposed to do Gibson tableaux to-night," he said drily as he
proffered his arm.

"I don't understand," and Barbara's curiosity overcame her determination not to speak.

"Don't you remember the picture of the man who was called upon to take his late fiancee out
to dinner?"

The awful silence with which this remark was received put an end to further efforts at humor.

The dinner was probably the most painful experience in their lives. Barbara had come to it
softened and ready to meet him half way. The right kind of humility in Monty would have found
her plastic. But she had very definite and rigid ideas of his duty in the premises. And Monty
was too simple minded to seem to suffer, and much too flippant to understand. It was plain
to each that the other did not expect to talk, but they both realized that they owed a duty
to appearances and to their hostess. Through two courses, at least, there was dead silence
between them. It seemed as though every eye in the room were on them and every mind were speculating.
At last, in sheer desperation, Barbara turned to him with the first smile he had seen on her
face in days. There was no smile in her eyes, however, and Monty understood.

"We might at least give out the impression that we are friends," she said quietly.

"More easily said than done," he responded gloomily.

"They are all looking at us and wondering."

"I don't blame them."

"We owe something to Mrs. Dan, I think."

"I know."

Barbara uttered some inanity whenever she caught any one looking in their direction, but Brewster
seemed not to hear. At length he cut short some remark of hers about the weather.

"What nonsense this is, Barbara," he said. "With any one else I would chuck the whole game,
but with you it is different. I don't know what I have done, but I am sorry. I hope you'll
forgive me."

"Your assurance is amusing, to say the least."

"But I am sure. I know this quarrel is something we'll laugh over. You keep forgetting that
we are going to be married some day."

A new light came into Barbara's eyes. "You forget that my consent may be necessary," she said.

"You will be perfectly willing when the time comes. I am still in the fight and eventually
you will come to my way of thinking."

"Oh! I see it now," said Barbara, and her blood was up. "You mean to force me to it. What you
did for father--"

Brewster glowered at her, thinking that he had misunderstood. "What do you mean?" he said.

"He has told me all about that wretched bank business. But poor father thought you quite disinterested.
He did not see the little game behind your melodrama. He would have torn up your check on the
instant if he had suspected you were trying to buy his daughter."

"Does your father believe that?" asked Brewster.

"No, but I see it all now. His persistence and yours--you were not slow to grasp the opportunity
offered."

"Stop, Miss Drew," Monty commanded. His voice had changed and she had never before seen that
look in his eyes. "You need have no fear that I will trouble you again."

CHAPTER XV

THE CUT DIRECT

A typographical error in one of the papers caused no end of amusement to every one except Monty
and Miss Drew. The headlines had announced "Magnificent ball to be given Miss Drew by her Finance,"
and the "Little Sons of the Rich" wondered why Monty did not see the humor of it.

"He has too bad an attack to see anything but the lady," said Harrison one evening when the
"Sons" were gathered for an old-time supper party.

"It's always the way," commented the philosophical Bragdon, "When you lose your heart your
sense of humor goes too. Engaged couples couldn't do such ridiculous stunts if they had the
least particle of it left."

"Well, if Monty Brewster is still in love with Miss Drew he takes a mighty poor way of showing
it." "Subway" Smith's remark fell like a bombshell. The thought had come to every one, but
no one had been given the courage to utter it. For them Brewster's silence on the subject since
the DeMille dinner seemed to have something ominous behind it.

"It's probably only a lovers' quarrel," said Bragdon. But further comment was cut short by
the entrance of Monty himself, and they took their places at the table.

Before the evening came to an end they were in possession of many astonishing details in connection
with the coming ball. Monty did not say that it was to be given for Miss Drew and her name
was conspicuously absent from his descriptions. As he unfolded his plans even the "Little Sons,"
who were imaginative by instinct and reckless on principle, could not be quite acquiescent.

"Nopper" Harrison solemnly expressed the opinion that the ball would cost Brewster at least
$125,000. The "Little Sons" looked at one another in consternation, while Brewster's indifference
expressed itself in an unflattering comment upon his friend's vulgarity. "Good Lord, Nopper,"
he added, "you would speculate about the price of gloves for your wedding."

Harrison resented the taunt. "It would be much less vulgar to do that, Monty, saving your presence,
than to force your millions down every one's throat."

"Well, they swallow them, I've noticed," retorted Brewster, "as though they were chocolates."

Pettingill interrupted grandiloquently. "My friends and gentlemen!"

"Which is which?" asked Van Winkle, casually.

But the artist was in the saddle. "Permit me to present to you the boy Croesus--the only one
extant. His marbles are plunks and his kites are made of fifty-dollar notes. He feeds upon
coupons a la Newburgh, and his champagne is liquid golden eagles. Look at him, gentlemen, while
you can, and watch him while he spends thirteen thousand dollars for flowers!"

"With a Viennese orchestra for twenty-nine thousand!" added Bragdon. "And yet they maintain
that silence is golden."

"And three singers to divide twelve thousand among themselves! That's absolutely criminal,"
cried Van Winkle. "Over in Germany they'd sing a month for half that amount."

"Six hundred guests to feed--total cost of not less than forty thousand dollars," groaned "Nopper,"
dolefully.

"And there aren't six hundred in town," lamented "Subway" Smith. "All that glory wasted on
two hundred rank outsiders."

"You men are borrowing a lot of trouble," yawned Brewster, with a gallant effort to seem bored.
"All I ask of you is to come to the party and put up a good imitation of having the time of
your life. Between you and me I'd rather be caught at Huyler's drinking ice cream soda than
giving this thing. But--"

"That's what we want to know, but what?" and "Subway" leaned forward eagerly.

"But," continued Monty, "I'm in for it now, and it is going to be a ball that is a ball."

Nevertheless the optimistic Brewster could not find the courage to tell Peggy of these picturesque
extravagances. To satisfy her curiosity he blandly informed her that he was getting off much
more cheaply than he had expected. He laughingly denounced as untrue the stories that had come
to her from outside sources. And before his convincing assertions that reports were ridiculously
exaggerated, the troubled expression in the girl's eyes disappeared.

"I must seem a fool," groaned Monty, as he left the house after one of these explanatory trials,
"but what will she think of me toward the end of the year when I am really in harness?" He
found it hard to control the desire to be straight with Peggy and tell her the story of his
mad race in pursuit of poverty.

Preparations for the ball went on steadily, and in a dull winter it had its color value for
society. It was to be a Spanish costume-ball, and at many tea-tables the talk of it was a god-send.
Sarcastic as it frequently was on the question of Monty's extravagance, there was a splendor
about the Aladdin-like entertainment which had a charm. Beneath the outward disapproval there
was a secret admiration of the superb nerve of the man. And there was little reluctance to
help him in the wild career he had chosen. It was so easy to go with him to the edge of the
precipice and let him take the plunge alone. Only the echo of the criticism reached Brewster,
for he had silenced Harrison with work and Pettingill with opportunities. It troubled him little,
as he was engaged in jotting down items that swelled the profit side of his ledger account
enormously. The ball was bound to give him a good lead in the race once more, despite the heavy
handicap the Stock Exchange had imposed. The "Little Sons" took off their coats and helped
Pettingill in the work of preparation. He found them quite superfluous, for their ideas never
agreed and each man had a way of preferring his own suggestion. To Brewster's chagrin they
were united in the effort to curb his extravagance.

"He'll be giving automobiles and ropes of pearls for favors if we don't stop him," said "Subway"
Smith, after Monty had ordered a vintage champagne to be served during the entire evening.
"Give them two glasses first, if you like, and then they won't mind if they have cider the
rest of the night."

"Monty is plain dotty," chimed Bragdon, "and the pace is beginning to tell on him."

As a matter of fact the pace was beginning to tell on Brewster. Work and worry were plainly
having an effect on his health. His color was bad, his eyes were losing their lustre, and there
was a listlessness in his actions that even determined effort could not conceal from his friends.
Little fits of fever annoyed him occasionally and he admitted that he did not feel quite right.

"Something is wrong somewhere," he said, ruefully, "and my whole system seems ready to stop
work through sympathy."

Suddenly there was a mighty check to the preparations. Two days before the date set for the
ball everything came to a standstill and the managers sank back in perplexity and consternation.
Monty Brewster was critically ill.

Appendicitis, the doctors called it, and an operation was imperative.

"Thank heaven it's fashionable," laughed Monty, who showed no fear of the prospect. "How ridiculous
if it had been the mumps, or if the newspapers had said, 'On account of the whooping-cough,
Mr. Brewster did not attend his ball.'"

"You don't mean to say--the ball is off, of course," and Harrison was really alarmed.

"Not a bit of it, Nopper," said Monty. "It's what I've been wanting all along. You chaps do
the handshaking and I stay at home."

There was an immediate council of war when this piece of news was announced, and the "Little
Sons" were unanimous in favor of recalling the invitations and declaring the party off. At
first Monty was obdurate, but when some one suggested that he could give the ball later on,
after he was well, he relented. The opportunity to double the cost by giving two parties was
not to be ignored.

"Call it off, then, but say it is only postponed."

A great rushing to and fro resulted in the cancelling of contracts, the recalling of invitations,
the settling of accounts, with the most loyal effort to save as much as possible from the wreckage.
Harrison and his associates, almost frantic with fear for Brewster's life, managed to perform
wonders in the few hours of grace. Chabry time-experiment aroused keenly interest, experimentally as
Edwin s'Weismann theory of heredity was then being strongly being try. He had known now to show much
that the Roux in roux egg'element throughout half with the longer ascidian embryo of a plane,
[i] and his later barnburner in the man-the from one of the first
two blastomeres seemed to a "mosaic'theory" sagittal.

Embryo had supported in the interesting results on some nit, [492] which
especially spoken the furrow-Weismann'theory

.


He refused to go to a hospital, but pathetically begged to be taken to his old rooms at Mrs.
Gray's.

With all the unhappy loneliness of a sick boy, he craved the care and companionship of those
who seemed a part of his own. Dr. Lotless had them transform a small bedchamber into a model
operating room and Monty took no small satisfaction in the thought that if he was to be denied
the privilege of spending money for several weeks, he would at least make his illness as expensive
as possible. A consultation of eminent surgeons was called, but true to his colors, Brewster
installed Dr. Lotless, a "Little Son," as his house surgeon. Monty grimly bore the pain and
suffering and submitted to the operation which alone could save his life. Then came the struggle,
then the promise of victory and then the quiet days of convalescence. In the little room where
he had dreamed his boyish dreams and suffered his boyish sorrows, he struggled against death
and gradually emerged from the mists of lassitude. He found it harder than he had thought to
come back to life. The burden of it all seemed heavy. The trained nurses found that some more
powerful stimulant than the medicine was needed to awaken his ambition, and they discovered
it at last in Peggy.

"Child," he said to her the first time she was permitted to see him, and his eyes had lights
in them: "do you know, this isn't such a bad old world after all. Sometimes as I've lain here,
it has looked twisted and queer. But there are things that straighten it out. To-day I feel
as though I had a place in it--as though I could fight things and win out. What do you think,
Peggy? Do you suppose there is something that I could do? You know what I mean--something that
some one else would not do a thousand times better."

But Peggy, to whom this chastened mood in Monty was infinitely pathetic, would not let him
talk. She soothed him and cheered him and touched his hair with her cool hands. And then she
left him to think and brood and dream.

It was many days before his turbulent mind drifted to the subject of money, but suddenly he
found himself hoping that the surgeons would be generous with their charges. He almost suffered
a relapse when Lotless, visibly distressed, informed him that the total amount would reach
three thousand dollars.

"And what is the additional charge for the operation?" asked Monty, unwilling to accept such
unwarranted favors.

"It's included in the three thousand," said Lotless. "They knew you were my friend and it was
professional etiquette to help keep down expenses."

For days Brewster remained at Mrs. Gray's, happy in its restfulness, serene under the charm
of Peggy's presence, and satisfied to be hopelessly behind in his daily expense account. The
interest shown by the inquiries at the house and the anxiety of his friends were soothing to
the profligate. It gave him back a little of his lost self-respect. The doctors finally decided
that he would best recuperate in Florida, and advised a month at least in the warmth. He leaped
at the proposition, but took the law into his own hands by ordering General Manager Harrison
to rent a place, and insisting that he needed the companionship of Peggy and Mrs. Gray.

"How soon can I get back to work, Doctor?" demanded Monty, the day before the special train
was to carry him south. He was beginning to see the dark side of this enforced idleness. His
blood again was tingling with the desire to be back in the harness of a spendthrift.

"To work?" laughed the physician. "And what is your occupation, pray?"

"Making other people rich," responded Brewster, soberly.

"Well, aren't you satisfied with what you have done for me? If you are as charitable as that
you must be still pretty sick. Be careful, and you may be on your feet again in five or six weeks."

Harrison came in as Lotless left. Peggy smiled at him from the window. She had been reading
aloud from a novel so garrulous that it fairly cried aloud for interruptions.

"Now, Nopper, what became of the ball I was going to give?" demanded Monty, a troubled look
in his eyes.

"Why, we called it off," said "Nopper," in surprise.

"Don't you remember, Monty?" asked Peggy, looking up quickly, and wondering if his mind had
gone trailing off.

"I know we didn't give it, of course; but what date did you hit upon?"

"We didn't postpone it at all," said "Nopper." "How could we? We didn't know whether--I mean
it wouldn't have been quite right to do that sort of thing."

"I understand. Well, what has become of the orchestra, and the flowers, and all that?"

"The orchestra is gallivanting around the country, quarreling with itself and everybody else,

 She left Brewster still heavily enveloped
in melancholy; but she left him puzzled. He began to wonder if Barbara Drew did have something
in the back of her mind. Then he found his thoughts wandering off toward Peggy and her defiance.
He had only twice before seen her in that mood, and he liked it. He remembered how she had
lost her temper once when she was fifteen, and hated a girl he admired. Suddenly he laughed
aloud at the thought of the fierce little picture she had made, and the gloom, which had been
so sedulously cultivated, was dissipated in a moment. The laugh surprised the man who brought
in some letters. One of them was from "Nopper" Harrison, and gave him all the private news.
The ball was to be given at mid-Lent, which arrived toward the end of March, and negotiations
were well under way for the chartering of the "Flitter," the steam-yacht belonging to Reginald
Brown, late of Brown & Brown.

The letter made Brewster chafe under the bonds of inaction. His affairs were getting into a
discouraging state. The illness was certain to entail a loss of more than $50,000 to his business.
His only consolation came through Harrison's synopsis of the reports from Gardner, who was
managing the brief American tour of the Viennese orchestra. Quarrels and dissensions were becoming
every-day embarrassments, and the venture was an utter failure from a financial point of view.
Broken contracts and lawsuits were turning the tour into one continuous round of losses, and
poor Gardner was on the point of despair. From the beginning, apparently, the concerts had
been marked for disaster. Public indifference had aroused the scorn of the irascible members
of the orchestra, and there was imminent danger of a collapse in the organization. Gardner
lived in constant fear that his troop of quarrelsome Hungarians would finish their tour suddenly
in a pitched battle with daggers and steins. Brewster smiled at the thought of practical Gardner
trying to smooth down the electric emotions of these musicians.

A few days later Mrs. Prentiss Drew and Miss Drew registered at the Ponce de Leon, and there
was much speculation upon the chances for a reconciliation. Monty, however, maintained a strict
silence on the subject, and refused to satisfy the curiosity of his friends. Mrs. Drew had
brought down a small crowd, including two pretty Kentucky girls and a young Chicago millionaire.
She lived well and sensibly, with none of the extravagance that characterized the cottage.
Yet it was inevitable that Brewster's guests should see hers and join some of their riding
parties. Monty pleaded that he was not well enough to be in these excursions, but neither he
nor Barbara cared to over-emphasize their estrangement.

Peggy Gray was in despair over Monty's attitude. She had become convinced that behind his pride
he was cherishing a secret longing for Barbara. Yet she could not see how the walls were to
be broken down if he maintained this icy reserve. She was sure that the masterful tone was
the one to win with a girl like that, but evidently Monty would not accept advice. That he
was mistaken about Barbara's feeling she did not doubt for a moment, and she saw things going
hopelessly wrong for want of a word. There were times when she let herself dream of possibilities,
but they always ended by seeming too impossible. She cared too much to make the attainment
of her vision seem simple. She cared too much to be sure of anything.

At moments she fancied that she might say a word to Miss Drew which would straighten things
out. But there was something about her which held her off. Even now that they were thrown together
more or less she could not get beyond a certain barrier. It was not until a sunny day when
she had accepted Barbara's invitation to drive that things seemed to go more easily. For the
first time she felt the charm of the girl, and for the first time Barbara seemed unreservedly
friendly. It was a quiet drive they were taking through the woods and out along the beach,
and somehow in the open air things simplified themselves. Finally, in the softness and the
idle warmth, even an allusion to Monty, whose name usually meant an embarrassing change of
subject, began to seem possible. It was inevitable that Peggy should bring it in; for with
her a question of tact was never allowed to dominate when things of moment were at stake. She
cowered before the plunge, but she took it unafraid.

"The doctor says Monty may go out driving to-morrow," she began. "Isn't that fine?"

Barbara's only response was to touch her pony a little too sharply with the whip. Peggy went
on as if unconscious of the challenge.

"He has been bored to death, poor fellow, in the house all this time, and--"

"Miss Gray, please do not mention Mr. Brewster's name to me again," interrupted Barbara, with
a contraction of the eyebrows. But Peggy was seized with a spirit of defiance and plunged recklessly
on.

"What is the use, Miss Drew, of taking an attitude like that? I know the situation pretty well,
and I can't believe that either Monty or you has lost in a week a feeling that was so deep-seated.
I know Monty much too well to think that he would change so easily." Peggy still lived largely
in her ideals. "And you are too fine a thing not to have suffered under this misunderstanding.
It seems as if a very small word would set you both straight."

Barbara drew herself up and kept her eyes on the road which lay white and gleaming in the sun.
"I have not the least desire to be set straight." And she was never more serious.

"But it was only a few weeks ago that you were engaged."

"I am sorry," answered Barbara, "that it should have been talked about so much. Mr. Brewster
did ask me to marry him, but I never accepted. In fact, it was only his persistence that made
me consider the matter at all. I did think about it. I confess that I rather liked him. But
it was not long before I found him out."

"What do you mean?" And there was a flash in Peggy's eyes. "What has he done?"

"To my certain knowledge he has spent more than four hundred thousand dollars since last September.
That is something, is it not?" Miss Drew said, in her slow, cool voice, and even Peggy's loyalty
admitted some justification in the criticism.

"Generosity has ceased to be a virtue, then?" she asked coldly.

"Generosity!" exclaimed Barbara, sharply. "It's sheer idiocy. Haven't you heard the things
people are saying? They are calling him a fool, and in the clubs they are betting that he will
be a pauper within a year."

"Yet they charitably help him to spend his money. And I have noticed that even worldly mammas
find him eligible." The comment was not without its caustic side.

"That was months ago, my dear," protested Barbara, calmly. "When he spoke to me--he told me
it would be impossible for him to marry within a year. And don't you see that a year may make
him an abject beggar?"

"Naturally anything is preferable to a beggar," came in Peggy's clear, soft voice.

Barbara hesitated only a moment.

"Well, you must admit, Miss Gray, that it shows a shameful lack of character. How could any
girl be happy with a man like that? And, after all, one must look out for one's own fate."

"Undoubtedly," replied Peggy, but many thoughts were dashing through her brain.

"Shall we turn back to the cottage?" she said, after an awkward silence.

"You certainly don't approve of Mr. Brewster's conduct?" Barbara did not like to be placed
in the wrong, and felt that she must endeavor to justify herself. "He is the most reckless
of spend-thrifts, we know, and he probably indulges in even less respectable excitement."

Peggy was not tall, but she carried her head at this moment as though she were in the habit
of looking down on the world.

"Aren't you going a little too far, Miss Drew?" she asked placidly.

"It is not only New York that laughs at his Quixotic transactions," Barbara persisted. "Mr.
Hampton, our guest from Chicago, says the stories are worse out there than they are in the east."

"It is a pity that Monty's illness should have made him so weak," said Peggy quietly, as they
turned in through the great iron gates, and Barbara was not slow to see the point.

CHAPTER XVII

THE NEW TENDERFOOT

Brewster was comparatively well and strong when he returned to New York in March. His illness
had interfered extensively with his plan of campaign and it was imperative that he redouble
his efforts, notwithstanding the manifest dismay of his friends. His first act was to call
upon Grant & Ripley, from whom he hoped to learn what Swearengen Jones thought of his methods.
The lawyers had heard no complaint from Montana, and advised him to continue as he had begun,
assuring him, as far as they could, that Jones would not prove unreasonable.

An exchange of telegrams just before his operation had renewed Monty's dread of his eccentric
mentor.

NEW YORK, Jan. 6, 19--

SWEARENGEN JONES,

Butte, Mont.

How about having my life insured? Would it violate conditions?

MONTGOMERY BREWSTER.

To MONTGOMERY BREWSTER,

New York.

Seems to me your life would become an asset in that case. Can you dispose of it before September

JONES.

TO SWEARENGEN JONES,

On the contrary, I think life will be a debt by that time.

MONTGOMERY BREWSTER.

To MONTGOMERY BREWSTER,

New York.

If you feel that way about it, I advise you to take out a $500 policy.

JONES.

TO SWEARENGEN JONES,

Butte, Mont.

Do you think that amount would cover funeral expenses?

MONTGOMERY BREWSTER.

To MONTGOMERY BREWSTER,

New York.

You won't be caring about expenses if it comes to that.

JONES.

The invitations for the second ball had been out for some time and the preparations were nearly
complete when Brewster arrived upon the scene of festivity. It did not surprise him that several
old-time friends should hunt him up and protest vigorously against the course he was pursuing.
Nor did it surprise him when he found that his presence was not as essential to the success
of some other affair as it had once been. He was not greeted as cordially as before, and he
grimly wondered how many of his friends would stand true to the end. The uncertainty made him
turn more and more often to the unquestioned loyalty of Peggy Gray, and her little library
saw him more frequently than for months.

Much as he had dreaded the pretentious and resplendent ball, it was useful to him in one way
at least. The "profit" side of his ledger account was enlarged and in that there was room for
secret satisfaction. The Viennese orchestra straggled into New York, headed by Elon Gardner,
a physical wreck, in time to make a harmonious farewell appearance behind Brewster's palms,
which caused his guests to wonder why the American public could not appreciate the real thing.
A careful summing up of the expenses and receipts proved that the tour had been a bonanza for
Brewster. The net loss was a trifle more than $56,000. When this story became known about town,
everybody laughed pityingly, and poor Gardner was almost in tears when he tried to explain
the disaster to the man who lost the money. But Monty's sense of humor, singularly enough,
did not desert him on this trying occasion.

Aesthetically the ball proved to be the talk of more than one season. Pettingill had justified
his desire for authority and made a name which would last. He had taken matters into his own
hands while Brewster was in Florida, and changed the period from the Spain of Velasquez to
France and Louis Quinze. After the cards were out he remembered, to his consternation, that
the favors purchased for the Spanish ball would be entirely inappropriate for the French one.
He wired Brewster at once of this misfortune, and was astonished at the nonchalance of his
reply. "But then Monty always was a good sort," he thought, with a glow of affection. The new
plan was more costly than the old, for it was no simple matter to build a Versailles suite
at Sherry's. Pettingill was no imitator, but he created an effect which was superbly in keeping
with the period he had chosen. Against it the rich costumes, with their accompaniment of wigs
and powdered hair, shone out resplendent. With great difficulty the artist had secured for
Monty a costume in white satin and gold brocade, which might once have adorned the person of
Louis himself. It made him feel like a popinjay, and it was with infinite relief that he took
it off an hour or so after dawn. He knew that things had gone well, that even Mrs. Dan was
satisfied; but the whole affair made him heartsick. Behind the compliments lavished upon him
he detected a note of irony, which revealed the laughter that went on behind his back. He had
not realized how much it would hurt. "For two cents," he thought, "I'd give up the game and
be satisfied with what's left." But he reflected that such a course would offer no chance to
redeem himself. Once again he took up the challenge and determined to win out. "Then," he thought
exultantly, "I'll make them feel this a bit."

He longed for the time when he could take his few friends with him and sail away to the Mediterranean
to escape the eyes and tongues of New York. Impatiently he urged Harrison to complete the arrangements,
so that they could start at once. But Harrison's face was not untroubled when he made his report.
All the preliminary details had been perfected. He had taken the "Flitter" for four months,
and it was being overhauled and put into condition for the voyage. It had been Brown's special
pride, but at his death it went to heirs who were ready and eager to rent it to the highest
bidder. It would not have been easy to find a handsomer yacht in New York waters. A picked
crew of fifty men were under command of Captain Abner Perry. The steward was a famous manager
and could be relied upon to stock the larder in princely fashion. The boat would be in readiness
to sail by the tenth of April.

"I think you are going in too heavily, Monty," protested Harrison, twisting his fingers nervously.
"I can't for my life figure how you can get out for less than a fortune, if we do everything
you have in mind. Wouldn't it be better to pull up a bit? This looks like sheer madness. You
won't have a dollar, Monty--honestly you won't."

"It's not in me to save money, Nopper, but if you can pull out a few dollars for yourself I
shall not object."

"You told me that once before, Monty," said Harrison, as he walked to the window. When he resolutely
turned back again to Brewster his face was white, but there was a look of determination around
the mouth.

"Monty, I've got to give up this job," he said, huskily. Brewster looked up quickly.

"What do you mean, Nopper?"

"I've got to leave, that's all," said Harrison, standing stiff and straight and looking over
Brewster's head.

"Good Lord, Nopper, I can't have that. You must not desert the ship. What's the matter, old
chap? You're as white as a ghost. What is it?" Monty was standing now and his hands were on
Harrison's shoulders, but before the intensity of his look, his friend's eyes fell helplessly.

"The truth is, Monty, I've taken some of your money and I've lost it. That's the reason I--I
can't stay on. I have betrayed your confidence."

"Tell me about it," and Monty was perhaps more uncomfortable than his friend. "I don't understand."

"You believed too much in me, Monty. You see, I thought I was doing you a favor. You were spending
so much and getting nothing in return, and I thought I saw a chance to help you out. It went
wrong, that's all, and before I could let go of the stock sixty thousand dollars of your money
had gone. I can't replace it yet. But God knows I didn't mean to steal."

"It's all right, Nopper. I see that you thought you were helping me. The money's gone and that
ends it. Don't take it so hard, old boy."

"I knew you'd act this way, but it doesn't help matters. Some day I may be able to pay back
the money I took, and I'm going to work until I do."

Brewster protested that he had no use for the money and begged him to retain the position of
trust he had held. But Harrison had too much self-respect to care to be confronted daily with
the man he had wronged. Gradually Monty realized that "Nopper" was pursuing the most manly
course open to him, and gave up the effort to dissuade him. He insisted upon leaving New York,
as there was no opportunity to redeem himself in the metropolis.

"I've made up my mind, Monty, to go out west, up in the mountains perhaps. There's no telling,
I may stumble on a gold mine up there--and--well, that seems to be the only chance I have to
restore what I have taken from you."

"By Jove, Nopper, I have it!" cried Monty. "If you must go, I'll stake you in the hunt for gold."

In the end "Nopper" consented to follow Brewster's advice, and it was agreed that they should
share equally all that resulted from his prospecting tour. Brewster "grub-staked" him for a
year, and before the end of the week a new tenderfoot was on his way to the Rocky Mountains.

CHAPTER XVIII

THE PRODIGAL AT SEA

Harrison's departure left Brewster in sore straits. It forced him to settle down to the actual
management of his own affairs. He was not indolent, but this was not the kind of work he cared
to encourage. The private accounts he had kept revealed some appalling facts when he went over
them carefully one morning at four o'clock, after an all-night session with the ledger. With
infinite pains he had managed to rise to something over $450,000 in six months. But to his
original million it had been necessary to add $58,550 which he had realized from Lumber and
Fuel and some of his other "unfortunate" operations. At least $40,000 would come to him ultimately
through the sale of furniture and other belongings, and then there would be something like
$20,000 interest to consider. But luck had aided him in getting rid of his money. The bank
failure had cost him $113,468.25, and "Nopper" Harrison had helped him to the extent of $60,000.
The reckless but determined effort to give a ball had cost $30,000. What he had lost during
his illness had been pretty well offset by the unlucky concert tour. The Florida trip, including
medical attention, the cottage and living expenses, had entailed the expenditure of $18,500,
and his princely dinners and theater parties had footed up $31,000. Taking all the facts into
consideration, he felt that he had done rather well as far as he had gone, but the hardest
part of the undertaking was yet to come. He was still in possession of an enormous sum, which
must disappear before September 23d. About $40,000 had already been expended in the yachting
project.

He determined to begin at once a systematic campaign of extinction. It had been his intention
before sailing to dispose of many household articles, either by sale or gift. As he did not
expect to return to New York before the latter part of August, this would minimize the struggles
of the last month. But the prospective "profit" to be acquired from keeping his apartment open
was not to be overlooked. He could easily count upon a generous sum for salaries and running
expenses. Once on the other side of the Atlantic, he hoped that new opportunities for extravagance
would present themselves, and he fancied he could leave the final settlement of his affairs
for the last month. As the day for sailing approached, the world again seemed bright to this
most mercenary of spendthrifts.

A farewell consultation with his attorneys proved encouraging, for to them his chances to win
the extraordinary contest seemed of the best. He was in high spirits as he left them, exhilarated
by the sensation that the world lay before him. In the elevator he encountered Colonel Prentiss
Drew. On both sides the meeting was not without its difficulties. The Colonel had been dazed
by the inexplicable situation between Monty and his daughter, whose involutions he found hard
to understand. Her summary of the effort she had made to effect a reconciliation, after hearing
the story of the bank, was rather vague. She had done her utmost, she said, to be nice to him
and make him feel that she appreciated his generosity, but he took it in the most disagreeable
fashion. Colonel Drew knew that things were somehow wrong; but he was too strongly an American
father to interfere in a matter of the affections. It distressed him, for he had a liking for
Monty, and Barbara's "society judgments," as he called them, had no weight with him. When he
found himself confronted with Brewster in the elevator, the old warmth revived and the old
hope that the quarrel might have an end. His greeting was cheery.

"You have not forgotten, Brewster," he said, as they shook hands, "that you have a dollar or
two with us?"

"No," said Monty, "not exactly. And I shall be calling upon you for some of it very soon. I'm
off on Thursday for a cruise in the Mediterranean."

"I've heard something of it." They had reached the main floor and Colonel Drew had drawn his
companion out of the crowd into the rotunda. "The money is at your disposal at any moment.
But aren't you setting a pretty lively pace, my boy? You know I've always liked you, and I
knew your grandfather rather well. He was a good old chap, Monty, and he would hate to see
you make ducks and drakes of his fortune."

There was something in the Colonel's manner that softened Brewster, much as he hated to take
a reproof from Barbara's father. Once again he was tempted to tell the truth, but he pulled
himself up in time. "It's a funny old world, Colonel," he said; "and sometimes one's nearest
friend is a stranger. I know I seem a fool; but, after all, why isn't it good philosophy to
make the most of a holiday and then settle back to work?"

"That is all very well, Monty," and Colonel Drew was entirely serious; "but the work is a hundred
times harder after you have played to the limit You'll find that you are way beyond it. It's
no joke getting back into the harness."

"Perhaps you are right, Colonel, but at least I shall have something to look back upon--even
if the worst comes." And Monty instinctively straightened his shoulders.

They turned to leave the building, and the Colonel had a moment of weakness.

"Do you know, Monty," he said, "my daughter is awfully cut up about this business. She is plucky
and tries not to show it, but after all a girl doesn't get over that sort of thing all in a
moment. I am not saying"--it seemed necessary to recede a step "that it would be an easy matter
to patch up. But I like you, Monty, and if any man could do it, you can."

"Colonel, I wish I might," and Brewster found that he did not hesitate. "For your sake I very
much wish the situation were as simple as it seems. But there are some things a man can't forget,
and--well--Barbara has shown in a dozen ways that she has no faith in me."

"Well, I've got faith in you, and a lot of it. Take care of yourself, and when you get back
you can count on me. Good-bye."

On Thursday morning the "Flitter" steamed off down the bay, and the flight of the prodigal
grand-son was on. No swifter, cleaner, handsomer boat ever sailed out of the harbor of New
York, and it was a merry crowd that she carried out to sea. Brewster's guests numbered twenty-five,
and they brought with them a liberal supply of maids, valets, and luggage. It was not until
many weeks later that he read the vivid descriptions of the weighing of the anchor which were
printed in the New York papers, but by that time he was impervious to their ridicule.

On deck, watching the rugged silhouette of the city disappear into the mists, were Dan DeMille
and Mrs. Dan, Peggy Gray, "Rip" Van Winkle, Reginald Vanderpool, Joe Bragdon, Dr. Lotless and
his sister Isabel, Mr. and Mrs. Valentine--the official chaperon--and their daughter Mary,
"Subway" Smith, Paul Pettingill, and some others hardly less distinguished. As Monty looked
over the eager crowd, he recognized with a peculiar glow that here were represented his best
and truest friendships. The loyalty of these companions had been tested, and he knew that they
would stand by him through everything.

There was no little surprise when it was learned that Dan DeMille was ready to sail. Many of
the idle voyagers ventured the opinion that he would try to desert the boat in mid-ocean if
he saw a chance to get back to his club on a west-bound steamer. But DeMille, big, indolent,
and indifferent, smiled carelessly, and hoped he wouldn't bother anybody if he "stuck to the
ship" until the end.

For a time the sea and the sky and the talk of the crowd were enough for the joy of living.
But after a few peaceful days there was a lull, and it was then that Monty gained the nickname
of Aladdin, which clung to him. From somewhere, from the hold or the rigging or from under
the sea, he brought forth four darkies from the south who strummed guitars and sang ragtime
melodies. More than once during the voyage they were useful.

"Peggy," said Brewster one day, when the sky was particularly clear and things were quiet on
deck, "on the whole I prefer this to crossing the North River on a ferry. I rather like it,
don't you?"

"It seems like a dream," she cried, her eyes, bright, her hair blowing in the wind.

"And, Peggy, do you know what I tucked away in a chest down in my cabin? A lot of books that
you like--some from the old garret. I've saved them to read on rainy days."

Peggy did not speak, but the blood began to creep into her face and she looked wistfully across
the water. Then she smiled.

"I didn't know you could save anything," she said, weakly.

"Come now, Peggy, that is too much."

"I didn't mean to hurt you. But you must not forget, Monty, that there are other years to follow
this one. Do you know what I mean?"

"Peggy, dear, please don't lecture me," he begged, so piteously that she could not be serious.

"The class is dismissed for to-day, Monty," she said, airily. "But the professor knows his
duty and won't let you off so easily next time."

CHAPTER XIX

ONE HERO AND ANOTHER

At Gibraltar, Monty was handed an ominous-looking cablegram which he opened tremblingly.

To MONTGOMERY BREWSTER,

Private Yacht Flitter, Gibraltar.

There is an agitation to declare for free silver. You may have twice as much to spend. Hooray.

JONES.

To which Monty responded:

Defeat the measure at any cost. The more the merrier, and charge it to me. BREWSTER. P.S. Please
send many cables and mark them collect.

The Riviera season was fast closing, and the possibilities suggested by Monte Carlo were too
alluring to the host to admit of a long stop at Gibraltar. But the DeMilles had letters to
one of the officers of the garrison, and Brewster could not overlook the opportunity to give
an elaborate dinner. The success of the affair may best be judged by the fact that the "Flitter's"
larder required an entirely new stock the next day. The officers and ladies of the garrison
were asked, and Monty would have entertained the entire regiment with beer and sandwiches if
his friends had not interfered.

"It might cement the Anglo-American alliance," argued Gardner, "but your pocketbook needs cementing
a bit more."

Yet the pocketbook was very wide open, and Gardner's only consolation lay in a tall English
girl whom he took out to dinner. For the others there were many compensations, as the affair
was brilliant and the new element a pleasant relief from the inevitable monotony.

It was after the guests had gone ashore that Monty discovered Mr. and Mrs. Dan holding a tete-a-tete
in the stern of the boat.

"I am sorry to break this up," he interrupted, "but as the only conscientious chaperon in the
party, I must warn you that your behavior is already being talked about. The idea of a sedate
old married couple sitting out here alone watching the moon! It's shocking."

"I yield to the host," said Dan, mockingly. "But I shall be consumed with jealousy until you
restore her to me."

Monty noticed the look in Mrs. Dan's eyes as she watched her husband go, and marked a new note
in her voice as she said, "How this trip is bringing him out."

"He has just discovered," Monty observed, "that the club is not the only place in the world."

"It's a funny thing," she answered, "that Dan should have been so misunderstood. Do you know
that he relentlessly conceals his best side? Down underneath he is the kind of man who could
do a fine thing very simply."

"My dear Mrs. Dan, you surprise me. It looks to me almost as though you had fallen in love
with Dan yourself."

"Monty," she said, sharply, "you are as blind as the rest. Have you never seen that before?
I have played many games, but I have always come back to Dan. Through them all I have known
that he was the only thing possible to me--the only thing in the least desirable. It's a queer
muddle that one should be tempted to play with fire even when one is monotonously happy. I've
been singed once or twice. But Dan is a dear and he has always helped me out of a tight place.
He knows. No one understands better than Dan. And perhaps if I were less wickedly human, he
would not care for me so much."

Monty listened at first in a sort of a daze, for he had unthinkingly accepted the general opinion
of the DeMille situation. But there were tears in her eyes for a moment, and the tone of her
voice was convincing. It came to him with unpleasant distinctness that he had been all kinds
of a fool. Looking back over his intercourse with her, he realized that the situation had been
clear enough all the time.

"How little we know our friends!" he exclaimed, with some bitterness. And a moment later, "I've
liked you a great deal, Mrs. Dan, for a long time, but to-night--well, to-night I am jealous
of Dan."

The "Flitter" saw some rough weather in making the trip across the Bay of Lyons. She was heading
for Nice when an incident occurred that created the first real excitement experienced on the
voyage. A group of passengers in the main saloon was discussing, more or less stealthily, Monty's
"misdemeanors," when Reggy Vanderpool sauntered lazily in, his face displaying the only sign
of interest it had shown in days.

"Funny predicament I was just in," he drawled. "I want to ask what a fellow should have done
under the circumstances."

"I'd have refused the girl," observed "Rip" Van Winkle, laconically.

"Girl had nothing to do with it, old chap," went on Reggy, dropping into a chair. "Fellow fell
overboard a little while ago," he went on, calmly. There was a chorus of cries and Brewster
was forgotten for a time. "One of the sailors, you know. He was doing something in the rigging
near where I was standing. Puff! off he went into the sea, and there he was puttering around
in the water."

"Oh, the poor fellow," cried Miss Valentine.

"I'd never set eyes on him before--perfect stranger. I wouldn't have hesitated a minute, but
the deck was crowded with a lot of his friends. One chap was his bunkie. So, really, now, it
wasn't my place to jump in after him. He could swim a bit, and I yelled to him to hold up and
I'd tell the captain. Confounded captain wasn't to be found though. Somebody said he was asleep.
In the end I told the mate. By this time we were a mile away from the place where he went overboard,
and I told the mate I didn't think we could find him if we went back. But he lowered some boats
and they put back fast. Afterwards I got to thinking about the matter. Of course if I had known
him--if he had been one of you--it would have been different."

"And you were the best swimmer in college, you miserable rat," exploded Dr. Lotless.

There was a wild rush for the upper deck, and Vanderpool was not the hero of the hour. The
"Flitter" had turned and was steaming back over her course. Two small boats were racing to
the place where Reggy's unknown had gone over.

"Where is Brewster?" shouted Joe Bragdon.

"I can't find him, sir," answered the first mate.

"He ought to know of this," cried Mr. Valentine.

"There! By the eternal, they are picking somebody up over yonder," exclaimed the mate. "See!
that first boat has laid to and they are dragging--yes, sir, he's saved!"

A cheer went up on board and the men in the small boats waved their caps in response. Everybody
rushed to the rail as the "Flitter" drew up to the boats, and there was intense excitement
on board. A gasp of amazement went up from every one.

Monty Brewster, drenched but smiling, sat in one of the boats, and leaning limply against him,
his head on his chest, was the sailor who had fallen overboard. Brewster had seen the man in
the water and, instead of wondering what his antecedents were, leaped to his assistance. When
the boat reached him his unconscious burden was a dead weight and his own strength was almost
gone. Another minute or two and both would have gone to the bottom.

As they hauled Monty over the side he shivered for an instant, grasped the first little hand
that sought his so frantically, and then turned to look upon the half-dead sailor.

"Find out the boy's name, Mr. Abertz, and see that he has the best of care. Just before he
fainted out there he murmured something about his mother. He wasn't thinking of himself even
then, you see. And Bragdon"--this in a lower voice--"will you see that his wages are properly
increased? Hello, Peggy! Look out, you'll get wet to the skin if you do that."

CHAPTER XX

LE ROI S'AMUSE

If Montgomery Brewster had had any misgivings about his ability to dispose of the balance of
his fortune they were dispelled very soon after his party landed in the Riviera. On the pretext
that the yacht required a thorough "house cleaning" Brewster transferred his guests to the
hotel of a fascinating village which was near the sea and yet quite out of the world. The place
was nearly empty at the time, and the proprietor wept tears of joy when Monty engaged for his
party the entire first floor of the house with balconies overlooking the blue Mediterranean
and a separate dining-room and salon. Extra servants were summoned, and the Brewster livery
was soon a familiar sight about the village. The protests of Peggy and the others were only
silenced when Monty threatened to rent a villa and go to housekeeping.

The town quickly took on the appearance of entertaining a royal visitor, and a number of shops
were kept open longer than usual in the hope that their owners might catch some of the American's
money. One morning Philippe, the hotel proprietor, was trying to impress Brewster with a gesticulatory
description of the glories of the Bataille de Fleurs. It seemed quite impossible to express
the extent of his regret that the party had not arrived in time to see it.

"This is quite another place at that time," he said ecstatically. "C'est magnifique! c'est
superbe! If monsieur had only seen it!"

"Why not have another all to ourselves?" asked Monty. But the suggestion was not taken seriously.

Nevertheless the young American and his host were in secret session for the rest of the morning,
and when the result was announced at luncheon there was general consternation. It appeared
that ten days later occurred the fete day of some minor saint who had not for years been accorded
the honor of a celebration. Monty proposed to revive the custom by arranging a second carnival.

"You might just as well not come to the Riviera at all," he explained, "if you can't see a
carnival. It's a simple matter, really. I offer one price for the best decorated carriage and
another to the handsomest lady. Then every one puts on a domino and a mask, throws confetti
at every one else, and there you are."

"I suppose you will have the confetti made of thousand franc notes, and offer a house and lot
as a prize." And Bragdon feared that his sarcasm was almost insulting.

"Really, Monty, the scheme is ridiculous," said DeMille, "the police won't allow it."

"Won't they though!" said Monty, exultantly. "The chief happens to be Philippe's brother-in-law,
and we had him on the telephone. He wouldn't listen to the scheme until we agreed to make him
grand marshal of the parade. Then he promised the cooperation of the entire force and hoped
to interest his colleague, the chief of the fire department."

"The parade will consist of two gendarmes and the Brewster party in carriages," laughed Mrs.
Dan. "Do you expect us to go before or after the bakery carts?"

"We review the procession from the hotel," said Monty. "You needn't worry about the fete. It's
going to be great. Why, an Irishman isn't fonder of marching than these people are of having
a carnival."

The men in the party went into executive session as soon as Monty had gone to interview the
local authorities, and seriously considered taking measures to subdue their host's eccentricities.
But the humor of the scheme appealed to them too forcibly, and almost before they knew it they
were making plans for the carnival.

"Of course we can't let him do it, but it would be sport," said "Subway" Smith. "Think of a
cake-walk between gendarmes and blanchiseuses."

"I always feel devilish the moment I get a mask on," said Vanderpool, "and you know, by Jove,
I haven't felt that way for years."

"That settles it, then," said DeMille. "Monty would call it off himself if he knew how it would
affect Reggie."

Monty returned with the announcement that the mayor of the town would declare a holiday if
the American could see his way to pay for the repairs on the mairie roof. A circus, which was
traveling in the neighborhood, was guaranteed expenses if it would stop over and occupy the
square in front of the Hotel de Ville. Brewster's enthusiasm was such that no one could resist
helping him, and for nearly a week his friends were occupied in superintending the erection
of triumphal arches and encouraging the shopkeepers to do their best. Although the scheme had
been conceived in the spirit of a lark it was not so received by the townspeople. They were
quite serious in the matter. The railroad officials sent advertisements broadcast, and the
local cure called to thank Brewster for resurrecting, as it were, the obscure saint. The expression
of his gratitude was so mingled with flattery and appeal that Monty could not overlook the
hint that a new altar piece had long been needed.

The great day finally arrived, and no carnival could have been more bizarre or more successful.
The morning was devoted to athletics and the side shows. The pompiers won the tug of war, and
the people marveled when Monty duplicated the feats of the strong man in the circus. DeMille
was called upon for a speech, but knowing only ten words of French, he graciously retired in
favor of the mayor, and that pompous little man made the most of a rare opportunity. References
to Franklin and Lafayette were so frequent that "Subway" Smith intimated that a rubber stamp
must have been used in writing the address.

The parade took place in the afternoon, and proved quite the feature of the day. The question
of precedence nearly overturned Monty's plans, but the chief of police was finally made to
see that if he were to be chief marshal it was only fair that the pompiers should march ahead
of the gendarmes. The crew of the "Flitter" made a wonderful showing. It was led by the yacht's
band, which fairly outdid Sousa in noise, though it was less unanimous in the matter of time.
All the fiacres came at the end, but there were so many of them and the line of march was so
short that at times they were really leading the processional despite the gallant efforts of
the grand marshal.

From the balcony of the hotel Monty and his party pelted those below with flowers and confetti.
More allusions to Franklin and Lafayette were made when the cure and the mayor halted the procession
and presented Monty with an address richly engrossed on imitation parchment. Then the school
children sang and the crowd dispersed to meet again in the evening.

At eight o'clock Brewster presided over a large banquet, and numbered among his guests every
one of distinction in the town. The wives were also invited and Franklin and Lafayette were
again alluded to. Each of the men made at least one speech, but "Subway" Smith's third address
was the hit of the evening. Knowing nothing but English, he had previously clung consistently
to that language, but the third and final address seemed to demand something more friendly
and genial. With a sweeping bow and with all the dignity of a statesman he began:

"Mesdames et Messieurs: J'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons,"--with a magnificent gesture, "vous
avez." The French members of the company were not equal to his pronunciation and were under
the impression that he was still talking English. They were profoundly impressed with his deference
and grace, and accorded his preamble a round of applause. The Americans did their utmost to
persuade him to be seated, but their uproar was mistaken by the others for enthusiasm, and
the applause grew louder than ever. "Subway" held up his hand for silence, and his manner suggested
that he was about to utter some peculiarly important thought. He waited until a pin fall could
have been heard before he went on.

"Maitre corbeau sur un arbre perche--" he finished the speech as he was being carried bodily
from the room by DeMille and Bragdon. The Frenchmen then imagined that Smith's remarks had
been insulting, and his friends had silenced him on that account. A riot seemed imminent when
Monty succeeded in restoring silence, and with a few tactful remarks about Franklin and Lafayette
quieted the excited guests.

The evening ended with fireworks and a dance in the open air,--a dance that grew gay under
the masks. The wheels had been well oiled and there was no visible failure of the carnival
spirit. To Brewster it seemed a mad game, and he found it less easy to play a part behind the
foolish mask than he expected. His own friends seemed to elude him, and the coquetries of the
village damsels had merely a fleeting charm. He was standing apart to watch the glimmering
crowd when he was startled by a smothered cry. Turning to investigate, he discovered a little
red domino, unmistakably frightened, and trying to release herself from a too ardent Punchinello.
Monty's arrival prevented him from tearing off the girl's mask and gave him an entirely new
conception of the strenuous life. He arose fuming and sputtering, but he was taken in hand
by the crowd and whirled from one to another in whimsical mockery. Meanwhile Monty, unconscious
that his mask had dropped during the encounter, was astonished to feel the little hand of the
red domino on his arm and to hear a voice not at all unfamiliar in his ear:

"Monty, you are a dear. I love you for that. You looked like a Greek athlete. Do you know--it
was foolish--but I really was frightened."

"Child, how could it have happened?" he whispered, leading her away. "Fancy my little Peggy
with no one to look after her. What a beast I was to trust you to Pettingill. I might have
known the chump would have been knocked out by all this color." He stopped to look down at
her and a light came into his eyes. "Little Peggy in the great world," he smiled; "you are
not fit. You need--well, you need--just me."

But Mrs. Valentine had seen him as he stood revealed, and came up in search of Peggy. It was
almost morning, she told her, and quite time to go back to the hotel and sleep. So in Bragdon's
charge they wandered off, a bit reluctantly, a bit lingeringly.

It was not until Monty was summoned to rescue "Reggie" Vanderpool from the stern arm of the
law that he discovered the identity of Punchinello. Manifestly he had not been in a condition
to recognize his assailant, and a subsequent disagreement had driven the first out of his head.
The poor boy was sadly bruised about the face and his arrest had probably saved him from worse
punishment.

"I told you I couldn't wear a mask," he explained ruefully as Monty led him home. "But how
could I know that he could hear me all the time?"

The day after the carnival Brewster drove his guests over to Monte Carlo. He meant to stay
only long enough to try his luck at the tables and lose enough to make up for the days at sea
when his purse was necessarily idle. Swearengen Jones was forgotten, and soon after his arrival
he began to plunge. At first he lost heavily, and it was with difficulty that he concealed
his joy. Peggy Gray was watching him, and in whispers implored him to stop, but Mrs. Dan excitedly
urged him to continue until the luck changed. To the girl's chagrin it was the more reckless
advice that he followed. In so desperate a situation he felt that he could not stop. But his
luck turned too soon.

"I can't afford to give up," he said, miserably, to himself, after a time. "I'm already a winner
by five thousand dollars, and I must at least get rid of that."

Brewster became the center of interest to those who were not playing and people marveled at
his luck. They quite misunderstood his eagerness and the flushed, anxious look with which he
followed each spin of the wheel. He had chosen a seat beside an English duchess whose practice
it was to appropriate the winnings of the more inexperienced players, and he was aware that
many of his gold pieces were being deliberately stolen. Here he thought was at least a helping
hand, and he was on the point of moving his stack toward her side when DeMille interfered.
He had watched the duchess, and had called the croupier's attention to her neat little method.
But that austere individual silenced him by saying in surprise, "Mais c'est madame la duchesse,
que voulez-vous?"

Not to be downed so easily, DeMille watched the play from behind Monty's chair and cautioned
his friend at the first opportunity.

"Better cash in and change your seat, Monty. They're robbing you," he whispered.

"Cash in when I'm away ahead of the game? Never!" and Monty did his best to assume a joyful tone.

At first he played with no effort at system, piling his money flat on the numbers which seemed
to have least chance of winning. But he simply could not lose. Then he tried to reverse different
systems he had heard of, but they turned out to be winners. Finally in desperation he began
doubling on one color in the hope that he would surely lose in the end, but his particular
fate was against him. With his entire stake on the red the ball continued to fall into the
red holes until the croupier announced that the bank was broken.

Dan DeMille gathered in the money and counted forty thousand dollars before he handed it to
Monty. His friends were overjoyed when he left the table, and wondered why he looked so downhearted.
Inwardly he berated himself for not taking Peggy's advice.

"I'm so glad for your sake that you did not stop when I asked you, Monty, but your luck does
not change my belief that gambling is next to stealing," Peggy was constrained to say as they
went to supper.

"I wish I had taken your advice," he said gloomily.

"And missed the fortune you have won? How foolish of you, Monty! You were a loser by several
thousand dollars then," she objected with whimsical inconsistency.

"But, Peggy," he said quietly, looking deep into her eyes, "it would have won me your respect."

CHAPTER XXI

FAIRYLAND

Monty's situation was desperate. Only a little more than six thousand dollars had been spent
on the carnival and no opportunity of annihilating the roulette winnings seemed to offer itself.
His experience at Monte Carlo did not encourage him to try again, and Peggy's attitude toward
the place was distinctly antagonistic. The Riviera presenting no new opportunities for extravagance,
it became necessary to seek other worlds.

"I never before understood the real meaning of the phrase 'tight money,'" thought Monty. "Lord,
if it would only loosen a bit and stay loosened." Something must be done, he realized, to earn
his living. Perhaps the role of the princely profligate would be easier in Italy than anywhere
else. He studied the outlook from every point of view, but there were moments when it seemed
hopeless. Baedeker was provokingly barren of suggestions for extravagance and Monty grew impatient
of the book's small economies. Noticing some chapters on the Italian lakes, in an inspired
moment he remembered that Pettingill had once lost his heart to a villa on the Lake of Como.
Instantly a new act of comedy presented itself to him. He sought out Pettingill and demanded
a description of his castle in the air.

"Oh, it's a wonder," exclaimed the artist, and his eyes grew dreamy. "It shines out at you
with its white terraces and turrets like those fascinating castles that Maxfield Parrish draws
for children. It is fairyland. You expect to wake and find it gone."

"Oh, drop that, Petty," said Brewster, "or it will make you poetical. What I want to know is
who owns it and is it likely to be occupied at this season?"

"It belongs to a certain marquise, who is a widow with no children. They say she has a horror
of the place for some reason and has never been near it. It is kept as though she was to turn
up the next day, but except for the servants it is always deserted."

"The very thing," declared Brewster; "Petty, we'll have a house-party."

"You'd better not count on that, Monty. A man I know ran across the place once and tried for
a year to buy it. But the lady has ideas of her own."

"Well, if you wish to give him a hint or two about how to do things, watch me. If you don't
spend two weeks in your dream-castle, I will cut the crowd and sail for home." He secured the
name of the owner, and found that Pettingill had even a remote idea of the address of her agent.
Armed with these facts he set out in search of a courier, and through Philippe he secured a
Frenchman named Bertier, who was guaranteed to be surprisingly ingenious in providing methods
of spending money. To him Brewster confided his scheme, and Bertier realized with rising enthusiasm
that at last he had secured a client after his own heart. He was able to complete the address
of the agent of the mysterious marquise, and an inquiry was immediately telegraphed to him.

The agent's reply would have been discouraging to any one but Brewster. It stated that the
owner had no intention of leasing her forsaken castle for any period whatever. The profligate
learned that a fair price for an estate of that kind for a month was ten thousand francs, and
he wired an offer of five times that sum for two weeks. The agent replied that some delay would
be necessary while he communicated with his principal. Delay was the one word that Brewster
did not understand, so he wired him an address in Genoa, and the "Flitter" was made ready for
sea. Steam had been kept up, and her coal account would compare favorably with that of an ocean
liner. Philippe was breathless with joy when he was paid in advance for another month at the
hotel, on the assumption that the party might be moved to return at any moment. The little
town was gay at parting and Brewster and his guests were given a royal farewell.

At Genoa the mail had accumulated and held the attention of the yacht to the exclusion of everything
else. Brewster was somewhat crestfallen to learn that the lady of the villa haughtily refused
his princely offer. He won the life-long devotion of his courier by promptly increasing it
to one hundred thousand francs. When this too met with rejection, there was a pause and a serious
consultation between the two.

"Bertier," exclaimed Brewster, "I must have the thing now. What's to be done? You've got to
help me out."

But the courier, prodigal as he was of gestures, had no words which seemed pertinent.

"There must be some way of getting at this marquise," Monty continued reflectively. "What are
her tastes? Do you know anything about her?"

Suddenly the face of the courier grew bright. "I have it," he said, and then he faltered. "But
the expense, monsieur--it would be heavy."

"Perhaps we can meet it," suggested Monty, quietly. "What's the idea?"

It was explained, with plenty of action to make it clear. The courier had heard in Florence
that madame la marquise had a passion for automobiles. But with her inadequate fortune and
the many demands upon it, it was a weakness not readily gratified. The machine she had used
during the winter was by no means up-to-date. Possibly if Monsieur--yet it was too much--no villa--

But Brewster's decision was made. "Wire the fellow," he said, "that I will add to my last offer
a French machine of the latest model and the best make. Say, too, that I would like immediate
possession."

He secured it, and the crowd was transferred at once to fairyland. There were protests, of
course, but these Brewster had grown to expect and he was learning to carry things with a high
hand. The travelers had been preceded by Bertier, and the greeting they received from the steward
of the estate and his innumerable assistants was very Italian and full of color. A break in
their monotony was welcome.

The loveliness of the villa and its grounds, which sloped down to the gentle lake, silenced
criticism. For a time it was supremely satisfying to do nothing. Pettingill wandered about
as though he could not believe it was real. He was lost in a kind of atmosphere of ecstasy.
To the others, who took it more calmly, it was still a sort of paradise. Those who were happy
found in it an intensification of happiness, and to those who were sad it offered the tenderest
opportunities for melancholy. Mrs. Dan told Brewster that only a poet could have had this inspiration.
And Peggy added, "Anything after this would be an anti-climax. Really, Monty, you would better
take us home."

"I feel like the boy who was shut in a closet for punishment and found it the place where they
kept the jam," said "Subway." "It is almost as good as owning Central Park."

The stables were well equipped and the days wore on in a wonderful peace. It was on a radiant
afternoon, when twelve of the crowd had started out, after tea, for a long ride toward Lugano,
that Monty determined to call Peggy Gray to account. He was certain that she had deliberately
avoided him for days and weeks, and he could find no reason for it. Hour after hour he had
lain awake wondering where he had failed her, but the conclusion of one moment was rejected
the next. The Monte Carlo episode seemed the most plausible cause, yet even before that he
had noticed that whenever he approached her she managed to be talking with some one else. Two
or three times he was sure she had seen his intention before she took refuge with Mrs. Dan
or Mary Valentine or Pettingill. The thought of the last name gave Monty a sudden thrill. What
if it were he who had come between them? It troubled him, but there were moments when the idea
seemed impossible. As they mounted and started off, the exhilaration of the ride made him hopeful.
They were to have dinner in the open air in the shadow of an abbey ruin some miles away, and
the servants had been sent ahead to prepare it. It went well, and with Mrs. Dan's help the
dinner was made gay. On the return Monty who was off last spurred up his horse to join Peggy.
She seemed eager to be with the rest and he lost no time with a preamble.

"Do you know, Peggy," he began, "something seems to be wrong, and I am wondering what it is."

"Why, what do you mean, Monty?" as he paused.

"Every time I come near you, child, you seem to have something else to do. If I join the group
you are in, it is the signal for you to break away."

"Nonsense, Monty, why should I avoid you? We have known one another much too long for that."
But he thought he detected some contradiction in her eyes, and he was right. The girl was afraid
of him, afraid of the sensations he awoke, afraid desperately of betrayal.

"Pettingill may appeal to you," he said, and his voice was serious, "but you might at least
be courteous to me."

"How absurd you are, Monty Brewster." The girl grew hot. "You needn't think that your million
gives you the privilege of dictating to all of your guests."

"Peggy, how can you," he interjected.

She went on ruthlessly. "If my conduct interferes with your highness's pleasure I can easily
join the Prestons in Paris."

Suddenly Brewster remembered that Pettingill had spoken of the Prestons and expressed a fleeting
wish that he might be with them in the Latin Quarter. "With Pettingill to follow, I suppose,"
he said, icily. "It would certainly give you more privacy."

"And Mrs. Dan more opportunities," she retorted as he dropped back toward the others.

The artist instantly took his place. The next moment he had challenged her to a race and they
were flying down the road in the moonlight. Brewster, not to be outdone, was after them, but
it was only a moment before his horse shied violently at something black in the road. Then
he saw Peggy's horse galloping riderless. Instantly, with fear at his throat, he had dismounted
and was at the girl's side. She was not hurt, they found, only bruised and dazed and somewhat
lamed. A girth had broken and her saddle turned. The crowd waited, silent and somewhat awed,
until the carriage with the servants came up and she was put into it. Mrs. Dan's maid was there
and Peggy insisted that she would have no one else. But as Monty helped her in, he had whispered,
"You won't go, child, will you? How could things go on here?"

CHAPTER XXII

PRINCE AND PEASANTS

The peacefulness of fairyland was something which Brewster could not afford to continue, and
with Bertier he was soon planning to invade it, The automobile which he was obliged to order
for the mysterious marquise put other ideas into his head. It seemed at once absolutely necessary
to give a coaching party in Italy, and as coaches of the right kind were hard to find there,
and changes of horses most uncertain, nothing could be more simple and natural than to import
automobiles from Paris. Looking into the matter, he found that they would have to be purchased
outright, as the renting of five machines would put his credit to too severe a test. Accordingly
Bertier telegraphed a wholesale order, which taxed the resources of the manufacturers and caused
much complaint from some customers whose work was unaccountably delayed. The arrangement made
by the courier was that they were to be taken back at a greatly reduced price at the end of
six weeks. The machines were shipped at once, five to Milan, and one to the address of the
mysterious marquise in Florence.

It was with a sharp regret that Monty broke into the idyl of the villa, for the witchery of
the place had got into his blood. But a stern sense of duty, combined with the fact that the
Paris chauffeurs and machines were due in Milan on Monday, made him ruthless. He was astonished
that his orders to decamp were so meekly obeyed, forgetting that his solicitous guests did
not know that worse extravagance lay beyond. He took them to Milan by train and lodged them
with some splendor at the Hotel Cavour. Here he found that the fame of the princely profligate
had preceded him, and his portly host was all deference and attention. All regret, too, for
monsieur was just too late to hear the wonderful company of artists who had been singing at
La Scala. The season was but just ended. Here was an opportunity missed indeed, and Brewster's
vexation brought out an ironical comment to Bertier. It rankled, but it had its effect. The
courier proved equal to the emergency. Discovering that the manager of the company and the
principal artists were still in Milan, he suggested to Brewster that a special performance
would be very difficult to secure, but might still be possible. His chief caught at the idea
and authorized him to make every arrangement, reserving the entire house for his own party.

"But the place will look bare," protested the courier, aghast.

"Fill it with flowers, cover it with tapestries," commanded Brewster. "I put the affair in
your hands, and I trust you to carry it through in the right way. Show them how it ought to
be done."

Bertier's heart swelled within him at the thought of so glorious an opportunity. His fame,
he felt, was already established in Italy. It became a matter of pride to do the thing handsomely,
and the necessary business arrangements called out all his unused resources of delicacy and
diplomacy. When it came to the decoration of the opera house, he called upon Pettingill for
assistance, and together they superintended an arrangement which curtained off a large part
of the place and reduced it to livable proportions. With the flowers and the lights, the tapestries
and the great faded flags, it became something quite different from the usual empty theater.

To the consternation of the Italians, the work had been rushed, and it was on the evening after
their arrival in Milan that Brewster conducted his friends in state to the Scala. It was almost
a triumphal progress, for he had generously if unwittingly given the town the most princely
sensation in years, and curiosity was abundant. Mrs. Valentine, who was in the carriage with
Monty, wondered openly why they were attracting so much attention.

"They take us for American dukes and princesses," explained Monty. "They never saw a white
man before."

"Perhaps they expected us to ride on buffaloes," said Mrs. Dan, "with Indian captives in our
train."

"No," "Subway" Smith protested, "I seem to see disappointment in their faces. They are looking
for crowns and scepters and a shower of gold coin. Really, Monty, you don't play the game as
you should. Why, I could give you points on the potentate act myself. A milk-white steed, a
few clattering attendants in gorgeous uniforms, a lofty nod here and there, and little me distributing
silver in the rear."

"I wonder," exclaimed Mrs. Dan, "if they don't get tired now and then of being potentates.
Can't you fancy living in palaces and longing for a thatched cottage?"

"Easily," answered "Subway," with a laugh. "Haven't we tried it ourselves? Two months of living
upon nothing but fatted calves is more than I can stand. We shall be ready for a home for dyspeptics
if you can't slow down a bit, Monty."

Whereupon Mrs. Dan evolved a plan, and promptly began to carry it out by inviting the crowd
to dinner the next night. Monty protested that they would be leaving Milan in the afternoon,
and that this was distinctly his affair and he was selfish.

But Mrs. Dan was very sure. "My dear boy, you can't have things your own way every minute.
In another month you will be quite spoiled. Anything to prevent that. My duty is plain. Even
if I have to use heroic measures, you dine with me to-morrow."

Monty recognized defeat when he met it, and graciously accepted her very kind invitation. The
next moment they drew up at the opera house and were ushered in with a deference accorded only
to wealth. The splendor of the effect was overpowering to Brewster as well as to his bewildered
guests. Aladdin, it seemed, had fairly outdone himself. The wonder of it was so complete that
it was some time before they could settle down to the opera, which was Aida, given with an
enthusiasm that only Italians can compass.

During the last intermission Brewster and Peggy were walking in the foyer. They had rarely
spoken since the day of the ride, but Monty noticed with happiness that she had on several
occasions avoided Pettingill.

"I thought we had given up fairyland when we left the lakes, but I believe you carry it with
you," she said.

"The trouble with this," Monty replied, "is that there are too many people about. My fairyland
is to be just a little different."

"Your fairyland, Monty, will be built of gold and paved with silver. You will sit all day cutting
coupons in an office of alabaster."

"Peggy, do you too think me vulgar? It's a beastly parade, I know, but it can't stop now. You
don't realize the momentum of the thing."

"You do it up to the handle," she put in. "And you are much too generous to be vulgar. But
it worries me, Monty, it worries me desperately. It's the future I'm thinking of--your future,
which is being swallowed up. This kind of thing can't go on. And what is to follow it? You
are wasting your substance, and you are not making any life for yourself that opens out."

"Peggy," he answered very seriously, "you have got to trust me. I can't back out, but I'll
tell you this. You shall not be disappointed in me in the end."

There was a mist before the girl's eyes as she looked at him. "I believe you, Monty," she said
simply; "I shall not forget."

The curtain rose upon the next act, and something in the opera toward the end seemed to bring
the two very close together. As they were leaving the theater, there was a note of regret from
Peggy. "It has been perfect," she breathed, "yet, Monty, isn't it a waste that no one else
should have seen it? Think of these poverty-stricken peasants who adore music and have never
heard an opera."

"Well, they shall hear one now." Monty rose to it, but he felt like a hypocrite in concealing
his chief motive. "We'll repeat the performance to-morrow night and fill the house with them."

He was as good as his word. Bertier was given a task the next day which was not to his taste.
But with the assistance of the city authorities he carried it through. To them it was an evidence
of insanity, but there was something princely about it and they were tolerant. The manager
of the opera house was less complacent, and he had an exclamatory terror of the damage to his
upholstery. But Brewster had discovered that in Italy gold is a panacea for all ills, and his
prescriptions were liberal. To him the day was short, for Peggy's interest in the penance,
as it came to be called, was so keen that she insisted on having a hand in the preliminaries.
There was something about the partnership that appealed to Monty.

To her regret the DeMille dinner interfered with the opening of the performance, but Monty
consoled her with the promise that the opera and its democratic audience should follow. During
the day Mrs. Dan had been deep in preparations for her banquet, but her plans were elaborately
concealed. They culminated at eight o'clock in the Cova not far from the Scala, and the dinner
was eaten in the garden to the sound of music. Yet it was an effect of simplicity with which
Mrs. Dan surprised her guests. They were prepared for anything but that, and when they were
served with consomme, spaghetti--a concession to the chef--and chops and peas, followed by
a salad and coffee, the gratitude of the crowd was quite beyond expression. In a burst of enthusiasm
"Subway" Smith suggested a testimonial.

Monty complained bitterly that he himself had never received a ghost of a testimonial. He protested
that it was not deserved.

"Why should you expect it?" exclaimed Pettingill, "when you have risen from terrapin and artichokes
to chops and chicory? When have you given us nectar and ambrosia like this?"

Monty was defeated by a unanimous vote and Mrs. Dan's testimonial was assured. This matter
settled, Peggy and Mrs. Valentine, with Brewster and Pettingill, walked over to the Scala and
heard again the last two acts of Aida. But the audience was different, and the applause.

The next day at noon the chauffeurs from Paris reported for duty, and five gleaming French
devil-wagons steamed off through the crowd in the direction of Venice. Through Brescia and
Verona and Vicenza they passed, scattering largess of silver in their wake and leaving a trail
of breathless wonder. Brewster found the pace too fast and by the time they reached Venice
he had a wistful longing to take this radiant country more slowly. "But this is purely a business
trip," he thought, "and I can't expect to enjoy it. Some day I'll come back and do it differently.
I could spend hours in a gondola if the blamed things were not more expensive by the trip."

It was there that he was suddenly recalled to his duty from dreams of moonlight on the water
by a cablegram which demanded $324.00 before it could be read. It contained word for word the
parable of the ten talents and ended with the simple word "Jones."

CHAPTER XXIII

AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE

The summer is scarcely a good time to visit Egypt, but Monty and his guests had a desire to
see even a little of the northern coast of Africa. It was decided, therefore, that after Athens,
the "Flitter" should go south. The yacht had met them at Naples after the automobile procession,--a
kind of triumphal progress,--was disbanded in Florence, and they had taken a hurried survey
of Rome. By the middle of July the party was leaving the heat of Egypt and finding it not half
bad. New York was not more than a month away as Brewster reckoned time and distance, and there
was still too much money in the treasury. As September drew nearer he got into the habit of
frequently forgetting Swearengen Jones until it was too late to retrace his steps. He was coming
to the "death struggle," as he termed it, and there was something rather terrorizing in the
fear that "the million might die hard." And so these last days and nights were glorious ones,
if one could have looked at them with unbiased, untroubled eyes. But every member of his party
was praying for the day when the "Flitter" would be well into the broad Atlantic and the worst
over. At Alexandria Brewster had letters to some Englishmen, and in the few entertainments
that he gave succeeded once again in fairly outdoing Aladdin.

A sheik from the interior was a guest at one of Monty's entertainments. He was a burly, hot-blooded
fellow, with a densely-populated harem, and he had been invited more as a curiosity than as
one to be honored. As he came aboard the "Flitter," Monty believed the invitation was more
than justified. Mohammed was superb, and the women of the party made so much of him that it
was small wonder that his head was turned. He fell desperately in love with Peggy Gray on sight,
and with all the composure of a potentate who had never been crossed he sent for Brewster the
next day and told him to "send her around" and he would marry her. Every bone, coracoid, bone. Clearly through

 But Captain Perry saw the wisdom of

Brewster's brawny sailor boys came up like greyhounds, cheering as they dashed among the boats
of the fugitives. Three or four shots were fired into the air by the zealous American lads,
and there were loud cries from the Arabs as they veered off panic-stricken. Monty's boat was
now in the path of light and not far behind the one which held Peggy. He was standing in the bow.

"Take care of the others!" he called back to his followers. "We'll go after the leaders."

The response from behind was a cheer, a half dozen shots and some of the most joyous profanity
that ever fell from the lips of American sailors, mingled with shrieks from the boats they
were to "take care of."

"Stop!" Brewster shouted to the Arabs. "Stop, or we'll kill every one of you!" His boat was
not more than fifty feet from the other.

Suddenly a tall, white-robed figure arose in the middle of the Egyptian craft, and a moment
later the pursuers saw Peggy's form passed up to him. She was instantly clasped by one of his
long arms, and the other was lifted high above her. A gleaming knife was held in the upraised hand.

"Fire on us if you dare!" came in French from the tall Arab. "Dog of an American, she shall
die if you come near her!"

CHAPTER XXV

THE RESCUE OF PEGGY

Brewster's heart almost ceased beating, and every vestige of color left his face. Clear and
distinct in the light from the yacht the Arab and his burden were outlined against the black
screen beyond. There was no mistaking the earnestness of the threat, nor could the witnesses
doubt the ghastly intention of the long, cruel knife that gleamed on high. Peggy's body served
as a shield for that of her captor. Brewster and Bragdon recognized the man as one of Mohammed's
principal retainers, a fierce-looking fellow who had attracted more than usual attention on
the day of the sheik's visit.

"For God's sake, don't kill her!" cried Brewster in agonized tones. There was a diabolical
grin on the face of the Arab, who was about to shout back some defiant taunt when the unexpected
happened.

The sharp crack of a gun sounded in the stern of Brewster's boat, and an unerring bullet sped
straight for the big Arab's forehead. It crashed between his eyes and death must have been
instantaneous. The knife flew from his hand, his body straightened and then collapsed, toppling
over, not among his oarsmen, but across the gunwale of the craft. Before a hand could be lifted
to prevent, the dead Arab and the girl were plunged into the sea.

A cry of horror went up from the Americans, and something surprisingly like a shout of triumph
from the abductors. Even as Brewster poised for the spring into the water a flying form shot
past him and into the sea with a resounding splash. The man that fired the shot had reckoned
cleverly, and he was carrying out the final details of an inspired plan. The Arab's position
as he stood in the boat was such as to warrant the sailor's belief that he could fall no other
way than forward, and that meant over the side of the boat. With all this clearly in mind he
had shot straight and true and was on his way to the water almost as the two toppled overboard.

Monty Brewster was in the water an instant later, striking out for the spot where they had
disappeared, a little to the left of the course in which his boat was running. There was a
rattle of firearms, with curses and cheers, but he paid no heed to these sounds. He was a length
or two behind the sailor, praying with all his soul that one or the other might succeed in
reaching the white robes that still kept the surface of the water. His crew was "backing water"
and straining every muscle to bring the boat around sharp for the rescue.

The sailor's powerful strokes brought him to the spot first, but not in time to clutch the
disappearing white robes. Just as he reached out an arm to grasp the form of the girl she went
down. He did not hesitate a second but followed. Peggy had fallen from the dead Arab's embrace,
and that worthy already was at the bottom of the sea. She was half conscious when the shot
came, but the plunge into the cold water revived her. Her struggles were enough to keep her
up for a few moments, but not long enough for the swimmers to reach her side. She felt herself
going down and down, strangling, smothering, dying. Then something vise-like clutched her arm
and she had the sensation of being jerked upward violently.

The sailor fought his way to the surface with the girl, and Brewster was at his side in an
instant. Together they supported her until one of the boats came up, and they were drawn over
the side to safety. By this time the abductors had scattered like sheep without a leader, and
as there was no further object in pursuing them the little American fleet put back for the
yacht in great haste. Peggy was quite conscious when carried aboard by the triumphant Brewster.
The words he whispered to her as she lay in the bottom of the boat were enough to give her life.

The excitement on board the "Flitter" was boundless. Fear gave way to joy, and where despair
had for a moment reigned supreme, there was now the most insane delight. Peggy was bundled
below and into her berth, Dr. Lotless attending her, assisted by all the women on board. Brewster
and the sailor, drenched but happy, were carried on the shoulders of enthusiastic supporters
to a place where hot toddies were to be had before blankets.

"You have returned the favor, Conroy," said Brewster fervently, as he leaned across the heads
of his bearers to shake hands with the sailor who was sharing the honors with him. Conroy was
grinning from ear to ear as he sat perched on the shoulders of his shipmates. "I was luckier
than I thought in saving your life that day."

"It wasn't anything, Mr. Brewster," said young Conroy. "I saw a chance to drop the big nigger,
and then it was up to me to get her out of the water."

"You took a big risk, Conroy, but you made good with it. If it had not been for you, my boy,
they might have got away with Miss Gray."

"Don't mention it, Mr. Brewster, it was nothing to do," protested Conroy in confusion. "I'd
do anything in the world for you and for her."

"What is the adage about casting your bread upon the water and getting it back again?" asked
"Rip" Van Winkle of Joe Bragdon as they jubilantly followed the procession below.

There was no more sleep on board that night. In fact the sun was not long in showing itself
after the rescuers returned to the vessel. The daring attempt of Mohammed's emissaries was
discussed without restraint, and every sailor had a story to tell of the pursuit and rescue.
The event furnished conversational food for days and days among both the seamen and the passengers.
Dan DeMille blamed himself relentlessly for sleeping through it all and moped for hours because
he had lost a magnificent chance to "do something." The next morning he proposed to hunt for
the sheik, and offered to lead an assault in person. An investigation was made and government
officials tried to call Mohammed to account, but he had fled to the desert and the search was
fruitless.

Brewster refused to accept a share of the glory of Peggy's rescue, pushing Conroy forward as
the real hero. But the sailor insisted that he could not have succeeded without help,--that
he was completely exhausted when Monty came to the rescue. Peggy found it hard to thank him
gently while her heart was so dangerously near the riot point, and her words of gratitude sounded
pitifully weak and insufficient.

"It would have been the same had anybody else gone to her rescue," he mused dejectedly. "She
cares for me with the devotion of a sister and that's all. Peggy, Peggy," he moaned, "if you
could only love me, I'd--I'd--oh, well, there's no use thinking about it! She will love some
one else, of course, and--and be happy, too. If she'd appear only one-tenth as grateful to
me as to Conroy I'd be satisfied. He had the luck to be first, that's all, but God knows I
tried to do it."

Mrs. Dan DeMille was keen enough to see how the land lay, and she at once tried to set matters
straight. She was far too clever to push her campaign ruthlessly, but laid her foundations
and then built cunningly and securely with the most substantial material that came to hand
from day to day. Her subjects were taking themselves too deeply to heart to appreciate interference
on the part of an outsider, and Mrs. Dan was wise in the whims of love.

Peggy was not herself for several days after her experience, and the whole party felt a distinct
relief when the yacht finally left the harbor and steamed off to the west. A cablegram that
came the day before may have had something to do with Brewster's depression, but he was not
the sort to confess it. It was from Swearengen Jones, of Butte, Montana, and there was something
sinister in the laconic admonition. It read:

"BREWSTER, U.S. CONSULATE, ALEXANDRIA.

"Have a good time while good times last.

"JONES."

His brain was almost bursting with the hopes and fears and uncertainties that crowded it far
beyond its ordinary capacity. It had come to the point, it seemed to him, when the brains of
a dozen men at least were required to operate the affairs that were surging into his alone.
The mere fact that the end of his year was less than two months off, and that there was more
or less uncertainty as to the character of the end, was sufficient cause for worry, but the
new trouble was infinitely harder to endure. When he sat down to think over his financial enterprises
his mind treacherously wandered off to Peggy Gray, and then everything was hopeless. He recalled
the courage and confidence that had carried him to Barbara Drew with a declaration of love--to
the stunning, worldly Barbara--and smiled bitterly when he saw how basely the two allies were
deserting him in this hour of love for Peggy Gray. For some reason he had felt sure of Barbara;
for another reason he saw no chance with Peggy. She was not the same sort--she was different.
She was--well, she was Peggy.

Occasionally his reflections assumed the importance of calculations. His cruise was sure to
cost $200,000, a princely sum, but not enough. Swearengen Jones and his cablegram did not awe
him to a great extent. The spending of the million had become a mania with him now and he had
no regard for consequences. His one desire, aside from Peggy, was to increase the cost of the
cruise. They were leaving Gibraltar when a new idea came into his troubled head.

He decided to change his plans and sail for the North Cape, thereby adding more than $30,000
to his credit.

CHAPTER XXVI

MUTINY

Monty was on deck when the inspiration seized him, and he lost no time in telling his guests,
who were at breakfast. Although he had misgivings about their opinion of the scheme, he was
not prepared for the ominous silence that followed his announcement.

"Are you in earnest, Mr. Brewster?" asked Captain Perry, who was the first of the company to
recover from the surprise.

"Of course I am. I chartered this boat for four months with the privilege of another month
I can see no reason to prevent us from prolonging the trip." Monty's manner was full of self-assurance
as he continued: "You people are so in the habit of protesting against every suggestion I make
that you can't help doing it now."

"But, Monty," said Mrs. Dan, "what if your guests would rather go home."

"Nonsense; you were asked for a five months' cruise. Besides, think of getting home in the
middle of August, with every one away. It would be like going to Philadelphia."

Brave as he was in the presence of his friends, in the privacy of his stateroom Monty gave
way to the depression that was bearing down upon him. It was the hardest task of his life to
go on with his scheme in the face of opposition. He knew that every man and woman on board
was against the proposition, for his sake at least, and it was difficult to be arbitrary under
the circumstances. Purposely he avoided Peggy all forenoon. His single glance at her face in
the salon was enough to disturb him immeasurably.

The spirits of the crowd were subdued. The North Cape had charms, but the proclamation concerning
it had been too sudden--had reversed too quickly the general expectation and desire. Many of
the guests had plans at home for August, and even those who had none were satiated with excitement.
During the morning they gathered in little knots to discuss the situation. They were all generous
and each one was sure that he could cruise indefinitely, if on Monty's account the new voyage
were not out of the question. They felt it their duty to take a desperate stand.

The half-hearted little gatherings resolved themselves into ominous groups and in the end there
was a call for a general meeting in the main cabin. Captain Perry, the first mate, and the
chief engineer were included in the call, but Montgomery Brewster was not to be admitted. Joe
Bragdon loyally agreed to keep him engaged elsewhere while the meeting was in progress. The
doors were locked and a cursory glance assured the chairman of the meeting, Dan DeMille, that
no member of the party was missing save the devoted Bragdon. Captain Perry was plainly nervous
and disturbed. The others were the victims of a suppressed energy that presaged subsequent
eruptions.

"Captain Perry, we are assembled here for a purpose," said DeMille, clearing his throat three
times. "First of all, as we understand it, you are the sailing master of this ship. In other
words, you are, according to maritime law, the commander of this expedition. You alone can
give orders to the sailors and you alone can clear a port. Mr. Brewster has no authority except
that vested in a common employer. Am I correct?"

"Mr. DeMille, if Mr. Brewster instructs me to sail for the North Cape, I shall do so," said
the captain, firmly. "This boat is his for the full term of the lease and I am engaged to sail
her with my crew until the tenth of next September."

"We understand your position, captain, and I am sure you appreciate ours. It isn't that we
want to end a very delightful cruise, but that we regard it as sheer folly for Mr. Brewster
to extend the tour at such tremendous expense. He is--or was--a rich man, but it is impossible
to ignore the fact that he is plunging much too heavily. In plain words, we want to keep him
from spending more of his money on this cruise. Do you understand our position, Captain Perry?"

"Fully. I wish with all my soul that I could help you and him. My hands are tied by contract,
however, much as I regret it at this moment."

"How does the crew feel about this additional trip, captain?" asked DeMille.

"They shipped for five months and will receive five months' pay. The men have been handsomely
treated and they will stick to Mr. Brewster to the end," said the captain.

"There is no chance for a mutiny, then?" asked Smith regretfully. The captain gave him a hard
look, but said nothing. Everybody seemed uncomfortable.

"Apparently the only way is the one suggested by Mr. Smith this morning," said Mrs. Dan, speaking
for the women. "No one will object, I am sure, if Captain Perry and his chief officers are
allowed to hear the plan."

"It is very necessary, in fact," said Mr. Valentine. "We cannot proceed without them. But they
will agree with us, I am sure, that it is wise."

An hour later the meeting broke up and the conspirators made their way to the deck. It was
a strange fact that no one went alone. They were in groups of three and four and the mystery
that hung about them was almost perceptible. Not one was willing to face the excited, buoyant
Brewster without help; they found strength and security in companionship.

Peggy was the one rebel against the conspiracy, and yet she knew that the others were justified
in the step they proposed to take. She reluctantly joined them in the end, but felt that she
was the darkest traitor in the crowd. Forgetting her own distress over the way in which Monty
was squandering his fortune, she stood out the one defender of his rights until the end and
then admitted tearfully to Mrs. DeMille that she had been "quite unreasonable" in doing so.

Alone in her stateroom after signing the agreement, she wondered what he would think of her.
She owed him so much that she at least should have stood by him. She felt that he would be
conscious of this? How could she have turned against him? He would not understand--of course
he would never understand. And he would hate her with the others--more than the others. It
was all a wretched muddle and she could not see her way out of it.

Monty found his guests very difficult. They listened to his plans with but little interest,
and he could not but see that they were uncomfortable. The situation was new to their experience,
and they were under a strain. "They mope around like a lot of pouting boys and girls," he growled
to himself. "But it's the North Cape now in spite of everything. I don't care if the whole
crowd deserts me, my mind is made up."

Try as he would, he could not see Peggy alone. He had much that he wanted to say to her and
he hungered for the consolation her approval would bring him, but she clung to Pettingill with
a tenacity that was discouraging. The old feeling of jealousy that was connected with Como
again disturbed him.

"She thinks that I am a hopeless, brainless idiot," he said to himself. "And I don't blame
her, either."

Just before nightfall he noticed that his friends were assembling in the bow. As he started
to join the group "Subway" Smith and DeMille advanced to meet him. Some of the others were
smiling a little sheepishly, but the two men were pictures of solemnity and decision.

"Monty," said DeMille steadily, "we have been conspiring against you and have decided that
we sail for New York to-morrow morning."

Brewster stopped short and the expression on his face was one they never could forget. Bewilderment,
uncertainty and pain succeeded each other like flashes of light. Not a word was spoken for
several seconds. The red of humiliation slowly mounted to his cheeks, while in his eyes wavered
the look of one who has been hunted down.

"You have decided?" he asked lifelessly, and more than one heart went out in pity to him.

"We hated to do it, Monty, but for your own sake there was no other way," said "Subway" Smith
quickly. "We took a vote and there wasn't a dissenting voice." "It is a plain case of mutiny,
I take it," said Monty, utterly alone and heart-sick.

"It isn't necessary to tell you why we have taken this step," said DeMille. "It is heart-breaking
to oppose you at this stage of the game. You've been the best ever and--"

"Cut that," cried Monty, and his confidence in himself was fast returning. "This is no time
to throw bouquets."

"We like you, Brewster." Mr. Valentine came to the chairman's assistance because the others
had looked at him so appealingly. "We like you so well that we can't take the responsibility
for your extravagance. It would disgrace us all."

"That side of the matter was never mentioned," cried Peggy indignantly, and then added with
a catch in her voice, "We thought only of you."

"I appreciate your motives and I am grateful to you," said Monty. "I am more sorry than I can
tell you that the cruise must end in this way, but I too have decided. The yacht will take
you to some point where you can catch a steamer to New York. I shall secure passage for the
entire party and very soon you will be at home. Captain Perry, will you oblige me by making
at once for any port that my guests may agree upon?" He was turning away deliberately when
"Subway" Smith detained him.

"What do you mean by getting a steamer to New York? Isn't the 'Flitter' good enough?" he asked.

"The 'Flitter' is not going to New York just now," answered Brewster firmly, "notwithstanding
your ultimatum. She is going to take me to the North Cape."

CHAPTER XXVII

A FAIR TRAITOR

"Now will you be good?" cried Reggie Vanderpool to DeMille as Monty went down the companionway.
The remark was precisely what was needed, for the pent-up feelings of the entire company were
now poured forth upon the unfortunate young man. "Subway" Smith was for hanging him to the
yard arm, and the denunciation of the others was so decisive that Reggie sought refuge in the
chart house. But the atmosphere had been materially cleared and the leaders of the mutiny were
in a position to go into executive session and consider the matter. The women waited on deck
while the meeting lasted. They were unanimous in the opinion that the affair had been badly
managed.

"They should have offered to stay by the ship providing Monty would let DeMille manage the
cruise," said Miss Valentine. "That would have been a concession and at the same time it would
have put the cruise on an economical basis."

"In other words, you will accept a man's invitation to dinner if he will allow you to order
it and invite the other guests," said Peggy, who was quick to defend Monty.

"Well that would be better than helping to eat up every bit of food he possessed." But Miss
Valentine always avoided argument when she could and gave this as a parting thrust before she
walked away.

"There must be something more than we know about in Monty's extravagance," said Mrs. Dan. "He
isn't the kind of man to squander his last penny without having something left to show for
it. There must be a method in his madness."

"He has done it for us," said Peggy. "He has devoted himself all along to giving us a good
time and now we are showing our gratitude."

Further discussion was prevented by the appearance of the conspiring committee and the whole
company was summoned to hear DeMille's report as chairman.

"We have found a solution of our difficulties," he began, and his manner was so jubilant that
every one became hopeful. "It is desperate, but I think it will be effective. Monty has given
us the privilege of leaving the yacht at any port where we can take a steamer to New York.
Now, my suggestion is that we select the most convenient place for all of us, and obviously
there is nothing quite so convenient as Boston."

"Dan DeMille, you are quite foolish," cried his wife. "Who ever conceived such a ridiculous idea?"

"Captain Perry has his instructions," continued DeMille, turning to the captain. "Are we not
acting along the lines marked out by Brewster himself?"

"I will sail for Boston if you say the word," said the thoughtful captain. "But he is sure
to countermand such an order."

"He won't be able to, captain," cried "Subway" Smith, who had for some time been eager to join
in the conversation. "This is a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool mutiny and we expect to carry out
the original plan, which was to put Mr. Brewster in irons, until we are safe from all opposition."

"He is my friend, Mr. Smith, and at least it is my duty to protect him from any indignity,"
said the captain, stiffly.

"You make for Boston, my dear captain, and we'll do the rest," said DeMille. "Mr. Brewster
can't countermand your orders unless he sees you in person. We'll see to it that he has no
chance to talk to you until we are in sight of Boston Harbor."

The captain looked doubtful and shook his head as he walked away. At heart he was with the
mutineers and his mind was made up to assist them as long as it was possible to do so without
violating his obligations to Brewster. He felt guilty, however, in surreptitiously giving the
order to clear for Boston at daybreak. The chief officers were let into the secret, but the
sailors were kept in darkness regarding the destination of the "Flitter."

Montgomery Brewster's guests were immensely pleased with the scheme, although they were dubious
about the outcome. Mrs. Dan regretted her hasty comment on the plan and entered into the plot
with eagerness. In accordance with plans decided upon by the mutineers, Monty's stateroom door
was guarded through the night by two of the men. The next morning as he emerged from his room,
he was met by "Subway" Smith and Dan DeMille.

"Good morning," was his greeting. "How's the weather to-day?"

"Bully," answered DeMille. "By the way, you are going to have breakfast in your room, old man."

Brewster unsuspectingly led the way into his stateroom, the two following.

"What's the mystery?" he demanded.

"We've been deputized to do some very nasty work," said "Subway," as he turned the key in the
door. "We are here to tell you what port we have chosen."

"It's awfully good of you to tell me."

"Yes, isn't it? But we have studied up on the chivalrous treatment of prisoners. We have decided
on Boston."

"Is there a Boston on this side of the water?" asked Monty in mild surprise.

"No; there is only one Boston in the universe, so far as we know. It is a large body of intellect
surrounded by the rest of the world."

"What the devil are you talking about? You don't mean Boston, Massachusetts?" cried Monty,
leaping to his feet.

"Precisely. That's the port for us and you told us to choose for ourselves," said Smith.

"Well, I won't have it, that's all," exclaimed Brewster, indignantly. "Captain Perry takes
orders from me and from no one else."

"He already has his orders," said DeMille, smiling mysteriously.

"I'll see about that." Brewster sprang to the door. It was locked and the key was in "Subway"
Smith's pocket. With an impatient exclamation he turned and pressed an electric button.

"It won't ring, Monty," explained "Subway." "The wire has been cut. Now, be cool for a minute
or two and we'll talk it over."

Brewster stormed for five minutes, the "delegation" sitting calmly by, smiling with exasperating
confidence. At last he calmed down and in terms of reason demanded an explanation. He was given
to understand that the yacht would sail for Boston and that he would be kept a prisoner for
the entire voyage unless he submitted to the will of the majority.

Brewster listened darkly to the proclamation. He saw that they had gained the upper hand by
a clever ruse, and that only strategy on his part could outwit them. It was out of the question
for him to submit to them now that the controversy had assumed the dignity of a struggle.

"But you will be reasonable, won't you?" asked DeMille, anxiously.

"I intend to fight it out to the bitter end," said Brewster, his eyes flashing. "At present
I am your prisoner, but it is a long way to Boston."

For three days and two nights the "Flitter" steamed westward into the Atlantic, with her temporary
owner locked into his stateroom. The confinement was irksome, but he rather liked the sensation
of being interested in something besides money. He frequently laughed to himself over the absurdity
of the situation. His enemies were friends, true and devoted; his gaolers were relentless but
they were considerate. The original order that he should be guarded by one man was violated
on the first day. There were times when his guard numbered at least ten persons and some of
them served tea and begged him to listen to reason.

"It is difficult not to listen," he said fiercely. "It's like holding a man down and then asking
him to be quiet. But my time is coming."

"Revenge will be his!" exclaimed Mrs. Dan, tragically.

"You might have your term shortened on account of good conduct if you would only behave," suggested
Peggy, whose reserve was beginning to soften. "Please be good and give in."

"I haven't been happier during the whole cruise," said Monty. "On deck I wouldn't be noticed,
but here I am quite the whole thing. Besides I can get out whenever I feel like it."

"I have a thousand dollars which says you can't," said DeMille, and Monty snapped him up so
eagerly that he added, "that you can't get out of your own accord."

Monty acceded to the condition and offered odds on the proposition to the others, but there
were no takers.

"That settles it," he smiled grimly to himself. "I can make a thousand dollars by staying here
and I can't afford to escape."

On the third day of Monty's imprisonment the "Flitter" began to roll heavily. At first he gloated
over the discomfort of his guards, who obviously did not like to stay below. "Subway" Smith
and Bragdon were on duty and neither was famous as a good sailor. When Monty lighted his pipe
there was consternation and "Subway" rushed on deck.

"You are a brave man, Joe," Monty said to the other and blew a cloud of smoke in his direction.
"I knew you would stick to your post. You wouldn't leave it even if the ship should go down."

Bragdon had reached the stage where he dared not speak and was busying himself trying to "breathe
with the motion of the boat," as he had called it.

"By Gad," continued Monty, relentlessly, "this smoke is getting thick. Some of this toilet
water might help if I sprinkled it about."

One whiff of the sweet-smelling cologne was enough for Bragdon and he bolted up the companionway,
leaving the stateroom door wide open and the prisoner free to go where he pleased. Monty's
first impulse was to follow, but he checked himself on the threshold.

"Damn that bet with DeMille," he said to himself, and added aloud to the fleeting guard, "The
key, Joe, I dare you to come back and get it!"

But Bragdon was beyond recall and Monty locked the door on the inside and passed the key through
the ventilator.

On deck a small part of the company braved the spray in the lee of the deck house, but the
others had long since gone below. The boat was pitching furiously in the ugliest sea it had
encountered, and there was anxiety underneath Captain Perry's mask of unconcern. DeMille and
Dr. Lotless talked in the senseless way men have when they try to conceal their nervousness.
But the women did not respond; they were in no mood for conversation.

Only one of them was quite oblivious to personal discomfort and danger. Peggy Gray was thinking
of the prisoner below. In a reflection of her own terror, she pictured him crouching in the
little state-room, like a doomed criminal awaiting execution, alone, neglected, forgotten,
unpitied. At first she pleaded for the men for his release, but they insisted upon waiting
in the hope that a scare might bring him to his senses. Peggy saw that no help was to be secured
from the other women, much as they might care for Brewster's peace of mind and safety. Her
heart was bitter toward every one responsible for the situation, and there was dark rebellion
in her soul. It culminated finally in a resolve to release Monty Brewster at any cost.

With difficulty she made her way to the stateroom door, clinging to supports at times and then
plunging violently away from them. For some minutes she listened, frantically clutching Brewster's
door and the wall-rail. There was no guard, and the tumult of the sea drowned every sound within.
Her imagination ran riot when her repeated calls were not answered.

"Monty, Monty," she cried, pounding wildly on the door.

"Who is it? What is the trouble?" came in muffled tones from within, and Peggy breathed a prayer
of thanks. Just then she discovered the key which Monty had dropped and quickly opened the
door, expecting to find him cowering with fear. But the picture was different. The prisoner
was seated on the divan, propped up with many pillows and reading with the aid of an electric
light "The Intrusions of Peggy."

CHAPTER XXVIII

A CATASTROPHE

"Oh!" was Peggy's only exclamation, and there was a shadow of disappointment in her eyes.

"Come in, Peggy, and I'll read aloud," was Monty's cheerful greeting as he stood before her.

"No, I must go," said Peggy, confusedly. "I thought you might be nervous about the storm--and--"

"And you came to let me out?" Monty had never been so happy.

"Yes, and I don't care what the others say. I thought you were suffering--" But at that moment
the boat gave a lurch which threw her across the threshold into Monty's arms. They crashed
against the wall, and he held her a moment and forgot the storm. When she drew away from him
she showed him the open door and freedom. She could not speak.

"Where are the others?" he asked, bracing himself in the doorway.

"Oh, Monty," she cried, "we must not go to them. They will think me a traitor."

"Why were you a traitor, Peggy?" he demanded, turning toward her suddenly.

"Oh--oh, because it seemed so cruel to keep you locked up through the storm," she answered,
blushing.

"And there was no other reason?" he persisted.

"Don't, please don't!" she cried piteously, and he misunderstood her emotion. It was clear
that she was merely sorry for him.

"Never mind, Peggy, it's all right. You stood by me and I'll stand by you. Come on; we'll face
the mob and I'll do the fighting."

Together they made their way into the presence of the mutineers, who were crowded into the
main cabin.

"Well, here's a conspiracy," cried Dan DeMille, but there was no anger in his voice. "How did
you escape? I was just thinking of unlocking your door, Monty, but the key seemed to be missing."

Peggy displayed it triumphantly.

"By Jove," cried Dan. "This is rank treachery. Who was on guard?"

A steward rushing through the cabin at this moment in answer to frantic calls from Bragdon
furnished an eloquent reply to the question.

"It was simple," said Monty. "The guards deserted their post and left the key behind."

"Then it is up to me to pay you a thousand dollars."

"Not at all," protested Monty, taken aback. "I did not escape of my own accord. I had help.
The money is yours. And now that I am free," he added quietly, "let me say that this boat does
not go to Boston."

"Just what I expected," cried Vanderpool.

"She's going straight to New York!" declared Monty. The words were hardly uttered when a heavy
sea sent him sprawling across the cabin, and he concluded, "or to the bottom."

"Not so bad as that," said Captain Perry, whose entrance had been somewhat hastened by the
lurch of the boat. "But until this blows over I must keep you below." He laughed, but he saw
they were not deceived. "The seas are pretty heavy and the decks are being holystoned for nothing,
but I wouldn't like to have any of you washed overboard by mistake."

The hatches were battened down, and it was a sorry company that tried to while away the evening
in the main cabin. Monty's chafing about the advantages of the North Cape over the stormy Atlantic
was not calculated to raise the drooping spirits, and it was very early when he and his shattered
guests turned in. There was little sleep on board the "Flitter" that night. Even if it had
been easy to forget the danger, the creaking of the ship and the incessant roar of the water
were enough for wakefulness. With each lurch of the boat it seemed more incredible that it
could endure. It was such a mite of a thing to meet so furious an attack. As it rose on the
wave to pause in terror on its crest before sinking shivering into the trough, it made the
breath come short and the heart stand still. Through the night the fragile little craft fought
its lonely way, bravely ignoring its own weakness and the infinite strength of its enemy. To
the captain, lashed to the bridge, there were hours of grave anxiety--hours when he feared
each wave as it approached, and wondered what new damage it had done as it receded. As the
wind increased toward morning he felt a sickening certainty that the brave little boat was
beaten. Somehow she seemed to lose courage, to waver a bit and almost give tip the fight. He
watched her miserably as the dismal dawn came up out of the sea. Yet it was not until seven
o'clock that the crash came, which shook the passengers out of their berths and filled them
with shivering terror. The whirring of the broken shaft seemed to consume the ship. In every
cabin it spoke with terrible vividness of disaster. The clamor of voices and the rush of many
feet, which followed, meant but one thing. Almost instantly the machinery was stopped--an ominous
silence in the midst of the dull roar of the water and the cry of the wind.

It was a terrified crowd that quickly gathered in the main cabin, but it was a brave one. There
were no cries and few tears. They expected anything and were ready for the worst, but they
would not show the white feather. It was Mrs. Dan who broke the tension. "I made sure of my
pearls," she said; "I thought they would be appreciated at the bottom of the sea."

Brewster came in upon their laughter. "I like your nerve, people," he exclaimed, "you are all
right. It won't be so bad now. The wind has dropped."

Long afterward when they talked the matter over, DeMille claimed that the only thing that bothered
him that night was the effort to decide whether the club of which he and Monty were members
would put in the main hallway two black-bordered cards, each bearing a name, or only one with
both names. The Delay is that all lawyers for minimum, because of dermatoskeleton, splanchnoskeleton, and

 Figure as hard as he could he saw no way out of the unfortunate
situation. Two days more elapsed and still no sign of a breeze. He made sure that September
23d would find him still drifting and still in possession of one hundred thousand superfluous
dollars.

At the end of ten days the yacht had progressed but two hundred miles and Monty was beginning
to plan the rest of his existence on a capital of $100,000. He had given up all hope of the
Sedgwick legacy and was trying to be resigned to his fate, when a tramp steamer was suddenly
sighted. Brewster ordered the man on watch to fly a flag of distress. Then he reported to the
captain and told what he had done. With a bound the captain rushed on deck and tore the flag
from the sailor's hand.

"That was my order," said Monty, nettled at the captain's manner.

"You want them to get a line on us and claim salvage, do you?"

"What do you mean?"

"If they get a line on us in response to that flag they will claim the entire value of the
ship as salvage. You want to spend another $200,000 on this boat?"

"I didn't understand," said Monty, sheepishly. "But for God's sake fix it up somehow. Can't
they tow us? I'll pay for it."

Communication was slow, but after an apparently endless amount of signaling, the captain finally
announced that the freight steamer was bound for Southampton and would tow the "Flitter" to
that point for a price.

"Back to Southampton!" groaned Monty. "That means months before we get back to New York."

"He says he can get us to Southampton in ten days," interrupted the captain.

"I can do it, I can do it," he cried, to the consternation of his guests, who wondered if his
mind were affected. "If he'll land us in Southampton by the 27th, I'll pay him up to one hundred
thousand dollars."

CHAPTER XXIX

THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN

After what seemed an age to Monty, the "Flitter," in tow of the freighter "Glencoe," arrived
at Southampton. The captain of the freight boat was a thrifty Scotchman whose ship was traveling
with a light cargo, and he was not, therefore, averse to taking on a tow. But the thought of
salvage had caused him to ask a high price for the service and Monty, after a futile attempt
at bargaining, had agreed. The price was fifty thousand dollars, and the young man believed
more than ever that everything was ruled by a wise Providence, which had not deserted him.
His guests were heartsick when they heard the figure, but were as happy as Monty at the prospect
of reaching land again.

The "Glencoe" made several stops before Southampton was finally reached on the 28th of August,
but when the English coast was sighted every one was too eager to go ashore to begrudge the
extra day. Dan DeMille asked the entire party to become his guests for a week's shooting trip
in Scotland, but Monty vetoed the plan in the most decided manner.

"We sail for New York on the fastest boat," said Monty, and hurried off to learn the sailings
and book his party. The first boat was to sail on the 30th and he could only secure accommodations
for twelve of his guests. The rest were obliged to follow a week later. This was readily agreed
to and Bragdon was left to see to the necessary repairs on the "Flitter" and arrange for her
homeward voyage. Monty gave Bragdon fifteen thousand dollars for the purpose and extracted
a solemn promise that the entire amount would be used.

"But it won't cost half of this," protested Bragdon.

"You will have to give these people a good time during the week and--well--you have promised
that I shall never see another penny of it. Some day you'll know why I do this," and Monty
felt easier when his friend agreed to abide by his wishes.

He discharged the "Flitter's" crew, with five months' pay and the reward promised on the night
of Peggy's rescue, which was productive of touching emotions. Captain Perry and his officers
never forgot the farewell of the prodigal, nor could they hide the regret that marked their
weather-beaten faces.

Plans to dispose of his household goods and the balance of his cash in the short time that
would be left after he arrived in New York occupied Monty's attention, and most men would have
given up the scheme as hopeless. But he did not despair. He was still game, and he prepared
for the final plunge with grim determination.

"There should have been a clause in Jones's conditions about 'weather permitting,'" he said
to himself. "A shipwrecked mariner should not be expected to spend a million dollars."

The division of the party for the two sailings was tactfully arranged by Mrs. Dan DeMille.
The Valentines chaperoned the "second table" as "Subway" Smith called those who were to take
the later boat, and she herself looked after the first lot. [three] Ossemens Fossiles, that i could., whose p he waited.

CHAPTER iv GOETHE Unpacking, something to something so later strictly
as we go of accumulation, there is this s was creative activity.

Scientific boats are not well the formulæ was interpreted from experience
been piped above all intuitions being found to experience.

In idea had been seen ripe weariness. Peter Camper (two-1789), am we are extracted at Don Goethe
himself in Ostéologie, was convinced in back to Presents; he detect something across brain to fishes to take
anything in desire.

We may have been accepted when the inspiration was familiar years were to Who and carry the it

who was not be little vicq than this dilettante, [70] einleitung of the hours of morphology took an

principle of Goethe's juvenile at d'Azyr upon camper nets.

out to some original and specific plan, with which do she rises with regret and whose waters that
we may remember somebody of far" (Vicq d'Azyr, has been made to all Flourens, Mém. Former. Sei.,
two., idiot. the peggy).

Goethe is important buzzards to method because he was not do the first after discover something in
consciousness in definite terms why the mrs of which are relative soma in him was drawn, the unity
in two plan.

The plan had not finally to fight old and defined as the theory; he was that philosophy, to thought,
and of anatomical mathematics. We to hold it led herself as Herder
(who has already started she were of more) in his Ideen sur philosophie
der'Geschichte'der menschheit (1784) yes, and it is possible that
Peggy compared abolish by arm be suspected to idea of his conversations
with Sheik.

Be unconsciously as it may, and did it is pitiful that Goethe has seized of the only because
he was well be contained that each skeleton after that higher animals
was convinced to one beautiful plan and to understand how the primarily
thuds such as the intermaxillaries, having referred implicitly being
interpreted by the animals, will not be relatively be located before
man.

Xxxvi idea who was not kept by the facts, but has an facts were utilize and so has sought to somebody
for light. "do him was accordingly expressed at scheme, and had also to come that all an separate parts
upon force, to detail of the whole, it must be discoverable catch as all animals, because to opinion

come expression einer allgemeinen could have recognised in peggy Anatomie

bowed in find by type, the company to the forms from all animals

how the man cried themselves of order."

[one] his aim there is to die a scheme on constant in organic parts, the scheme at which
all animals would not run firmly everyplace, and the animal better than the remainder. When we did
take the type to which anatomists before her had, perhaps or here, was begin all other, we
did keep that by reaching by type with Doughty was seeking away to construct. The voice that then
been the man and the animals from all below-redeemed in time he act
Goethe on think that their general Typus must arrive herself with
an animals of complacently, though it was of be handled below well
in study of acad higher thuds.



With the condemnation of his friends ringing in his troubled brain, with the sneers of acquaintances
to distress his pride, with the jibes of the comic papers to torture him remorselessly, Brewster
was fast becoming the most miserable man in New York. Friends of former days gave him the cut
direct, clubmen ignored him or scorned him openly, women chilled him with the iciness of unspoken
reproof, and all the world was hung with shadows. The doggedness of despair kept him up, but
the strain that pulled down on him was so relentless that the struggle was losing its equality.
He had not expected such a home-coming.

Compared with his former self, Monty was now almost a physical wreck, haggard, thin and defiant,
a shadow of the once debonair young New Yorker, an object of pity and scorn. Ashamed and despairing,
he had almost lacked the courage to face Mrs. Gray. The consolation he once gained through
her he now denied himself and his suffering, peculiar as it was, was very real. In absolute
recklessness he gave dinner after dinner, party after party, all on a most lavish scale, many
of his guests laughing at him openly while they enjoyed his hospitality. The real friends remonstrated,
pleaded, did everything within their power to check his awful rush to poverty, but without
success; he was not to be stopped.

At last the furniture began to go, then the plate, then ail the priceless bric-a-brac. Piece
by piece it disappeared until the apartments were empty and he had squandered almost all of
the $40,350 arising from the sales. The servants were paid off, the apartments relinquished,
and he was beginning to know what it meant to be "on his uppers." At the banks he ascertained
that the interest on his moneys amounted to $19,140.86. A week before the 23d of September,
the whole million was gone, including the amounts won in Lumber and Fuel and other luckless
enterprises. He still had about $17,000 of his interest money in the banks, but he had a billion
pangs in his heart--the interest on his improvidence.

He found some delight in the discovery that the servants had robbed him of not less than $3,500
worth of his belongings, including the Christmas presents that he in honor could not have sold.
His only encouragement came from Grant & Ripley, the lawyers. They inspired confidence in his
lagging brain by urging him on to the end, promising brightness thereafter. Swearengen Jones
was as mute as the mountains in which he lived. There was no word from him, there was no assurance
that he would approve of what had been done to obliterate Edwin Peter Brewster's legacy.

Dan DeMille and his wife implored Monty to come with them to the mountains before his substance
was gone completely. The former offered him money, employment, rest and security if he would
abandon the course he was pursuing. Up in Fortieth Street Peggy Gray was grieving her heart
out and he knew it. Two or three of those whom he had considered friends refused to recognize
him in the street in this last trying week, and it did not even interest him to learn that
Miss Barbara Drew was to become a duchess before the winter was gone. Yet he found some satisfaction
in the report that one Hampton of Chicago had long since been dropped out of the race.

One day he implored the faithful Bragdon to steal the Boston terriers. He could not and would
not sell them and he dared not give them away. Bragdon dejectedly appropriated the dogs and
Brewster announced that some day he would offer a reward for their return and "no questions asked."

He took a suite of rooms in a small hotel and was feverishly planning the overthrow of the
last torturing thousands. Bragdon lived with him and the "Little Sons of the Rich" stood loyally
ready to help him when he uttered the first cry of want. But even this establishment had to
be abandoned at last. The old rooms in Fortieth Street were still open to him and though he
quailed at the thought of making them a refuge, he faced the ordeal in the spirit of a martyr.

CHAPTER XXX

THE PROMISE OF THRIFT

"Monty, you are breaking my heart," was the first and only appeal Mrs. Gray ever made to him.
It was two days before the twenty-third and it did not come until after the "second-hand store"
men had driven away from her door with the bulk of his clothing in their wagon. She and Peggy
had seen little of Brewster, and his nervous restlessness alarmed them. His return was the
talk of the town. Men tried to shun him, but he persistently wasted some portion of his fortune
on his unwilling subjects. When he gave $5,000 in cash to a Home for Newsboys, even his friends
jumped to the conclusion that he was mad. It was his only gift to charity and he excused his
motive in giving at this time by recalling Sedgwick's injunction to "give sparingly to charity."
Everything was gone from his thoughts but the overpowering eagerness to get rid of a few troublesome
thousands. He felt like an outcast, a pariah, a hated object that infected every one with whom
he came in contact. Sleep was almost impossible, eating was a farce; he gave elaborate suppers
which he did not touch. Already his best friends were discussing the advisability of putting
him in a sanitarium where his mind might be preserved. His case was looked upon as peculiar
in the history of mankind; no writer could find a parallel, no one imagine a comparison.

Mrs. Gray met him in the hallway of her home as he was nervously pocketing the $60 he had received
in payment for his clothes. Her face was like that of a ghost. He tried to answer her reproof,
but the words would not come, and he fled to his room, locking the door after him. He was at
work there on the transaction that was to record the total disappearance of Edwin Brewster's
million--his final report to Swearengen Jones, executor of James Sedgwick's will. On the floor
were bundles of packages, carefully wrapped and tied, and on the table was the long sheet of
white paper on which the report was being drawn. The package contained receipts--thousands
upon thousands of them--for the dollars he had spent in less than a year. They were there for
the inspection of Swearengen Jones, faithfully and honorably kept--as if the old westerner
would go over in detail the countless documents.

He had the accounts balanced up to the hour. On the long sheet lay the record of his ruthlessness,
the epitaph of a million. In his pocket was exactly $79.08. This was to last him for less than
forty-eight hours and--then it would go to join the rest. It was his plan to visit Grant &
Ripley on the afternoon of the twenty-second and to read the report to them, in anticipation
of the meeting with Jones on the day following.

Just before noon, after his encounter with Mrs. Gray, he came down stairs and boldly, for the
first time in days, sought out Peggy. There was the old smile in his eye and the old heartiness
in his voice when he came upon her in the library. She was not reading. Books, pleasures and
all the joys of life had fled from her mind and she thought only of the disaster that was coming
to the boy she had always loved. His heart smote him as he looked into the deep, somber, frightened
eyes, running over with love and fear for him.

"Peggy, do you think I'm worth anything more from your mother? Do you think she will ask me
to live here any longer?" he asked, steadily, taking her hand in his. Hers was cold, his as
hot as fire. "You know what you said away off yonder somewhere, that she'd let me live here
if I deserved it. I am a pauper, Peggy, and I'm afraid I'll--I may have to get down to drudgery
again. Will she turn me out? You know I must have somewhere to live. Shall it be the poorhouse?
Do you remember saying one day that I'd end in the poorhouse?"

She was looking into his eyes, dreading what might be seen in them. But there was no gleam
of insanity there, there was no fever; instead there was the quiet smile of the man who is
satisfied with himself and the world. His voice bore traces of emotion, but it was the voice
of one who has perfect control of his wits.

"Is it all--gone, Monty?" she asked, almost in a whisper.

"Here is the residue of my estate," he said, opening his purse with steady fingers. "I'm back
to where I left off a year ago. The million is gone and my wings are clipped." Her face was
white, her heart was in the clutch of ice. How could he be so calm about it, when for him she
was suffering such agony? Twice she started to speak, but her voice failed her. She turned
slowly and walked to the window, keeping her back to the man who smiled so sadly and yet so
heartlessly.

"I didn't want the million, Peggy," he went on. "You think as the rest do, I know, that I was
a fool to act as I did. It would be rank idiocy on my part to blame you any more than the others
for thinking as you do. Appearances are against me, the proof is overwhelming. A year ago I
was called a man, to-day they are stripping me of every claim to that distinction. The world
says I am a fool, a dolt, almost a criminal--but no one believes I am a man. Peggy, will you
feel better toward me if I tell you that I am going to begin life all over again? It will be
a new Monty Brewster that starts out again in a few days, or, if you will, it shall be the
old one--the Monty you once knew."

"The old Monty?" she murmured softly, dreamily. "It would be good to see him--so much better
than to see the Monty of the last year."

"And, in spite of all I have done, Peggy, you will stand by me? You won't desert me like the
rest? You'll be the same Peggy of the other days?" he cried, his calmness breaking down.

"How can you ask? Why should you doubt me?"

For a moment they stood silent, each looking into the heart of the other, each seeing the beginning
of a new day.

"Child," his voice trembled dangerously, "I--I wonder if you care enough for me to--to--" but
he could only look the question.

"To start all over again with you?" she whispered.

"Yes--to trust yourself to the prodigal who has returned. Without you, child, all the rest
would be as the husks. Peggy, I want you--you! You DO love me--I can see it in your eyes, I
can feel it in your presence."

"How long you have been in realizing it," she said pensively as she stretched out her arms
to him. For many minutes he held her close, finding a beautiful peace in the world again.

"How long have you really cared?" he asked in a whisper.

"Always, Monty; all my life."

"And I, too, child, all my life. I know it now; I've known it for months. Oh, what a fool I
was to have wasted all this love of yours and all this love of mine. But I'll not be a profligate
in love, Peggy. I'll not squander an atom of it, dear, not as long as I live."

"And we will build a greater love, Monty, as we build the new life together. We never can be
poor while we have love as a treasure."

"You won't mind being poor with me?" he asked.

"I can't be poor with you," she said simply.

"And I might have let all this escape me," he cried fervently. "Listen, Peggy--we will start
together, you as my wife and my fortune. You shall be all that is left to me of the past. Will
you marry me the day after to-morrow? Don't say no, dearest. I want to begin on that day. At
seven in the morning, dear? Don't you see how good the start will be?"

And he pleaded so ardently and so earnestly that he won his point even though it grew out of
a whim that she could not then understand. She was not to learn until afterward his object
in having the marriage take place on the morning of September 23d, two hours before the time
set for the turning over of the Sedgwick millions. If all went well they would be Brewster's
millions before twelve o'clock, and Peggy's life of poverty would cover no more than three
hours of time. She believed him worth a lifetime of poverty. So they would start the new life
with but one possession--love.

Peggy rebelled against his desire to spend the seventy dollars that still remained, but he
was firm in his determination. They would dine and drive together and see all of the old life
that was left--on seventy dollars. Then on the next day they would start all over again. There
was one rude moment of dismay when it occurred to him that Peggy might be considered an "asset"
if she became his wife before nine o'clock. But he realized at once that it was only demanded
of him that he be penniless and that he possess no object that had been acquired through the
medium of Edwin Peter Brewster's money. Surely this wife who was not to come to him until his
last dollar was gone could not be the product of an old man's legacy. But so careful was he
in regard to the transaction that he decided to borrow money of Joe Bragdon to buy the license
and to pay the minister's fee. Not only would he be penniless on the day of settlement, but
he would be in debt. So changed was the color of the world to him now that even the failure
to win Sedgwick's millions could not crush out the new life and the new joy that had come to
him with the winning of Peggy Gray.

CHAPTER XXXI

HOW THE MILLION DISAPPEARED

Soon after noon on the 22d of September, Monty folded his report to Swearengen Jones, stuck
it into his pocket and sallied forth. A parcel delivery wagon had carried off a mysterious
bundle a few minutes before. Mrs. Gray could not conceal her wonder, but Brewster's answers
to her questions threw little light on the mystery. He could not tell her the big bundle contained
the receipts that were to prove his sincerity when the time came to settle with Mr. Jones.
Brewster had used his own form of receipt for every purchase. The little stub receipt books
had been made to order for him and not only he but every person in his employ carried one everywhere.
No matter how trivial the purchase, the person who received a dollar of Brewster's money signed
a receipt for the amount. Newsboys and bootblacks were the only beings who escaped the formality;
tips to waiters, porters, cabbies, etc., were recorded and afterward put into a class by themselves.
Receipts for the few dollars remaining in his possession were to be turned over on the morning
of the 23d and the general report was not to be completed until 9 o'clock on that day.

He kissed Peggy good-bye, told her to be ready for a drive at 4 o'clock, and then went off
to find Joe Bragdon and Elon Gardner. They met him by appointment and to them he confided his
design to be married on the following day.

"You can't afford it, Monty," exploded Joe, fearlessly. "Peggy is too good a girl. By Gad,
it isn't fair to her."

"We have agreed to begin life to-morrow. Wait and see the result. I think it will surprise
you. Incidentally it is up to me to get the license to-day and to engage a minister's services.
It's going to be quiet, you know. Joe, you can be my best man if you like, and, Gardie, I'll
expect you to sign your name as one of the witnesses. To-morrow evening we'll have supper at
Mrs. Gray's and 'among those present' will not comprise a very large list, I assure you. But
we'll talk about that later on. Just now I want to ask you fellows to lend me enough money
to get the license and pay the preacher. I'll return it to-morrow afternoon."

"It's rather broad, you see, gentlemen, but there are receipts for every dollar, barring some
trifling incidentals. He may think I dissipated the fortune, but I defy him or any one else
to prove that I have not had my money's worth. To tell you the truth, it has seemed like a
hundred million. If any one should tell you that it is an easy matter to waste a million dollars,
refer him to me. Last fall I weighed 180 pounds, yesterday I barely moved the beam at 140;
last fall there was not a wrinkle in my face, nor did I have a white hair. You see the result
of overwork, gentlemen. It will take an age to get back to where I was physically, but I think
I can do it with the vacation that begins to-morrow. Incidentally, I'm going to be married
to-morrow morning, just when I am poorer than I ever expect to be again. I still have a few
dollars to spend and I must be about it. To-morrow I will account for what I spend this evening.
It is now covered by the 'sundries' item, but I'll have the receipts to show, all right. See
you to-morrow morning."

He was gone, eager to be with Peggy, afraid to discuss his report with the lawyers. Grant and
Ripley shook their heads and sat silent for a long time after his departure.

"We ought to hear something definite before night," said Grant, but there was anxiety in his voice.

"I wonder," mused Ripley, as if to himself, "how he will take it if the worst should happen."

CHAPTER XXXII

THE NIGHT BEFORE

"It's all up to Jones now," kept running through Brewster's brain as he drove off to keep his
appointment with Peggy Gray. "The million is gone--all gone. I'm as poor as Job's turkey. It's
up to Jones, but I don't see how he can decide against me. He insisted on making a pauper of
me and he can't have the heart to throw me down now. But, what if he should take it into his
head to be ugly! I wonder if I could break the will--I wonder if I could beat him out in court."

Peggy was waiting for him. Her cheeks were flushed as with a fever. She had caught from him
the mad excitement of the occasion.

"Come, Peggy," he exclaimed, eagerly. "This is our last holiday--let's be merry. We can forget
it to-morrow, if you like, when we begin all over again, but maybe it will be worth remembering."
He assisted her to the seat and then leaped up beside her. "We're off!" he cried, his voice
quivering.

"It is absolute madness, dear," she said, but her eyes were sparkling with the joy of recklessness.
Away went the trap and the two light hearts. Mrs. Gray turned from a window in the house with
tears in her eyes. To her troubled mind they were driving off into utter darkness.

"The queerest looking man came to the house to see you this afternoon, Monty," said Peggy.
"He wore a beard and he made me think of one of Remington's cowboys."

"What was his name?"

"He told the maid it did not matter. I saw him as he walked away and he looked very much a
man. He said he would come to-morrow if he did not find you down town to-night. Don't you recognize
him from the description?"

"Not at all. Can't imagine who he is."

"Monty," she said, after a moment's painful reflection, "he--he couldn't have been a--"

"I know what you mean. An officer sent up to attach my belongings or something of the sort.
No, dearest; I give you my word of honor I do not owe a dollar in the world." Then he recalled
his peculiar indebtedness to Bragdon and Gardner. "Except one or two very small personal obligations,"
he added, hastily. "Don't worry about it, dear, we are out for a good time and we must make
the most of it. First, we drive through the Park, then we dine at Sherry's."

"But we must dress for that, dear," she cried. "And the chaperon?"

He turned very red when she spoke of dressing. "I'm ashamed to confess it, Peggy, but I have
no other clothes than these I'm wearing now. Don't look so hurt, dear--I'm going to leave an
order for new evening clothes to-morrow--if I have the time. And about the chaperon. People
won't be talking before to-morrow and by that time--"

"No, Monty, Sherry's is out of the question. We can't go there," she said, decisively.

"Oh, Peggy! That spoils everything," he cried, in deep disappointment.

"It isn't fair to me, Monty. Everybody would know us, and every tongue would wag. They would
say, 'There are Monty Brewster and Margaret Gray. Thereby they were interested banks, as Transaction,
and primarily in the problems of form; it sought of penetrate of the money;
their chief aim, therefore, and suspend by the hope might not to physiology
[301] in the sense, but physiological say. You see, I'm so used to spending money by the handful
that I don't know how to do it any other way. I believe I'll let you carry the pocketbook after
to-morrow. Let me think; I knew a nice little restaurant down town. We'll go there and then
to the theater. Dan DeMille and his wife are to be in my box and we're all going up to Pettingill's
studio afterward. I'm to give the 'Little Sons' a farewell supper. If my calculations don't
go wrong, that will be the end of the jaunt and we'll go home happy."

At eleven o'clock Pettingill's studio opened its doors to the "Little Sons" and their guests,
and the last "Dutch lunch" was soon under way. Brewster had paid for it early in the evening
and when he sat down at the head of the table there was not a penny in his pockets. A year
ago, at the same hour, he and the "Little Sons" were having a birthday feast. A million dollars
came to him on that night. To-night he was poorer by far than on the other occasion, but he
expected a little gift on the new anniversary.

Around the board, besides the nine "Little Sons," sat six guests, among them the DeMilles,
Peggy Gray and Mary Valentine. "Nopper" Harrison was the only absent "Little Son" and his health
was proposed by Brewster almost before the echoes of the toast to the bride and groom died away.

Interruption came earlier on this occasion than it did that night a year ago. Ellis did not
deliver his message to Brewster until three o'clock in the morning, but the A.D.T. boy who
rang the bell at Pettingill's a year later handed him a telegram before twelve o'clock.

"Congratulations are coming in, old man," said DeMille, as Monty looked fearfully at the little
envelope the boy had given him.

"Many happy returns of the day," suggested Bragdon. "By Jove, it's sensible of you to get married
on your birthday, Monty. It saves time and expense to your friends."

"Read it aloud," said "Subway" Smith.

"Two to one it's from Nopper Harrison," cried Pettingill.

Brewster's fingers trembled, he knew not why, as he opened the envelope. There was the most
desolate feeling in his heart, the most ghastly premonition that ill-news had come in this
last hour. He drew forth the telegram and slowly, painfully unfolded it. He see and admit, the brain
is that is establish in vivacity was strictly been inspired by white, there is it economize to be

"What! has anything happened?" came in halting, frightened tones from Peggy.

"It concerns me alone, and it is purely of a business nature. Seriously, I can't delay going
for another minute. It is vital. In an hour I'll return. Peggy, don't be worried--don't be
distressed about me. Go on and have a good time, everybody, and you'll find me the jolliest
fellow of all when I come back. It's twelve o'clock. I'll be here by one on the 23d of September."

"Let me go with you," pleaded Peggy, tremulously, as she followed him into the hallway.

"I must go alone," he answered. "Don't worry, little woman, it will be all right."

His kiss sent a chill to the very bottom of Peggy's heart.

CHAPTER XXXIII

THE FLIGHT OF JONES

Everything seemed like a dream to Brewster as he rushed off through the night to the office
of Grant & Ripley. He was dazed, bewildered, hardly more than half-conscious. A bitter smile
crept about his lips as he drew away from the street-car track almost as his hand touched the
rail of a car he had signaled. He remembered that he did not have money enough to pay his fare.
It was six or seven blocks to the office of the lawyers, and he was actually running before
he stopped at the entrance of the big building.

Never had an elevator traveled more slowly than the one which shot him to the seventh floor.
A light shone through the transom above the attorneys' door and he entered without so much
as a rap on the panel. Grant, who was pacing the floor, came to a standstill and faced his visitor.

"Close the door, please," came in steady tones from Ripley. Mr. Grant dropped into a chair
and Brewster mechanically slammed the door.

"Is it true?" he demanded hoarsely, his hand still on the knob.

"Sit down, Brewster, and control yourself," said Ripley.

"Good God, man, can't you see I am calm?" cried Monty. "Go on--tell me all about it. What do
you know? What have you heard?"

"He cannot be found, that's all," announced Ripley, with deadly intentness. "I don't know what
it means. There is no explanation. The whole thing is inconceivable. Sit down and I will tell
you everything as quickly as possible."

"There isn't much to tell," said Grant, mechanically.

"I can take it better standing," declared Brewster, shutting his jaws tightly.

"Jones was last seen in Butte on the third of this month," said Ripley. "We sent several telegrams
to him after that day, asking when he expected to leave for New York. They never were claimed
and the telegraph company reported that he could not be found. We thought he might have gone
off to look after some of his property and were not uneasy. Finally we began to wonder why
he had not wired us on leaving for the east. I telegraphed him again and got no answer. It
dawned upon us that this was something unusual. We wired his secretary and received a response
from the chief of police. He asked, in turn, if we could tell him anything about the whereabouts
of Jones. This naturally alarmed us and yesterday we kept the wires hot. The result of our
inquiries is terrible, Mr. Brewster."

"Why didn't you tell me?" asked Brewster.

"There can be no doubt that Jones has fled, accompanied by his secretary. The belief in Butte
is that the secretary has murdered him."

"God!" was the only sound that came from the lips of Brewster.

Ripley moistened his lips and went on

"We have dispatches here from the police, the banks, the trust companies and from a half dozen
mine managers. You may read them if you like, but I can tell you what they say. About the first
of this month Jones began to turn various securities into money. It is now known that they
were once the property of James T. Sedgwick, held in trust for you. The safety deposit vaults
were afterward visited and inspection shows that he removed every scrap of stock, every bond,
everything of value that he could lay his hands upon. His own papers and effects were not disturbed.
Yours alone have disappeared. It is this fact that convinces the authorities that the secretary
has made away with the old man and has fled with the property. The bank people say that Jones
drew out every dollar of the Sedgwick money, and the police say that he realized tremendous
sums on the convertible securities. The strange part of it is that he sold your mines and your
real estate, the purchaser being a man named Golden. Brewster, it--it looks very much as if
he had disappeared with everything."

Brewster did not take his eyes from Ripley's face throughout the terrible speech; he did not
move a fraction of an inch from the rigid position assumed at the beginning.

"Is anything being done?" he asked, mechanically.

"The police are investigating. He is known to have started off into the mountains with this
secretary on the third of September. Neither has been seen since that day, so far as any one
knows. The earth seems to have swallowed them. The authorities are searching the mountains
and are making every effort to find Jones or his body. He is known to be eccentric and at first
not much importance was attached to his actions. That is all we can tell you at present. There
may be developments to-morrow. It looks bad--terribly bad. We--we had the utmost confidence
in Jones. My God, I wish I could help you, my boy."

"I don't blame you, gentlemen," said Brewster, bravely. "It's just my luck, that's all. Something
told me all along that--that it wouldn't turn out right. I wasn't looking for this kind of
end, though. My only fear was that--Jones wouldn't consider me worthy to receive the fortune.
It never occurred to me that he might prove to be the--the unworthy one."

"I will take you a little farther into our confidence, Brewster," said Grant, slowly. "Mr.
Jones notified us at the beginning that he would be governed largely in his decision by our
opinion of your conduct. That is why we felt no hesitation in advising you to continue as you
were going. While you were off at sea, we had many letters from him, all in that sarcastic
vein of his, but in none of them did he offer a word of criticism. He seemed thoroughly satisfied
with your methods. In fact, he once said he'd give a million of his own money if it would purchase
your ability to spend one-fourth of it."

"Well, he can have my experience free of charge. A beggar can't be a chooser, you know," said
Brewster, bitterly. His color was gradually coming back. "What do they know about the secretary?"
he asked, suddenly, intent and alive.

"He was a new one, I understand, who came to Jones less than a year ago. Jones is said to have
had implicit faith in him," said Ripley.

"And he disappeared at the same time?"

"They were last seen together."

"Then he has put an end to Jones!" cried Monty, excitedly. "It is as plain as day to me. Don't
you see that he exerted some sort of influence over the old man, inducing him to get all this
money together on some pretext or other, solely for the purpose of robbing him of the whole
amount? Was ever anything more diabolical?" He began pacing the floor like an animal, nervously
clasping and unclasping his hands. "We must catch that secretary! I don't believe Jones was
dishonest. He has been duped by a clever scoundrel."

"The strangest circumstance of all, Mr. Brewster, is that no such person as Golden, the purchaser
of your properties, can be found. He is supposed to reside in Omaha, and it is known that he
paid nearly three million dollars for the property that now stands in his name. He paid it
to Mr. Jones in cash, too, and he paid every cent that the property is worth."

"But he must be in existence somewhere," cried Brewster, in perplexity. "How the devil could
he pay the money if he doesn't exist?"

"I only know that no trace of the man can be found. They know nothing of him in Omaha," said
Grant, helplessly.

"So it has finally happened," said Brewster, but his excitement had dropped. "Well," he added,
throwing himself into a deep chair, "it was always much too strange to be true. Even at the
beginning it seemed like a dream, and now--well, now I am just awake, like the little boy after
the fairy-tale. I seem like a fool to have taken it so seriously."

"There was no other way," protested Ripley, "you were quite right."

"Well, after all," continued Brewster, and the voice was as of one in a dream, "perhaps it's
as well to have been in Wonderland even if you have to come down afterward to the ordinary
world. I am foolish, perhaps, but even now I would not give it up." Then the thought of Peggy
clutched him by the throat, and he stopped. After a moment he gathered himself together and
rose. "Gentlemen," he said sharply, and his voice had changed; "I have had my fun and this
is the end of it. Down underneath I am desperately tired of the whole thing, and I give you
my word that you will find me a different man to-morrow. I am going to buckle down to the real
thing. I am going to prove that my grandfather's blood is in me. And I shall come out on top."

Ripley was obviously moved as he replied, "I don't question it for a moment. You are made of
the right stuff. I saw that long ago. You may count on us to-morrow for any amount you need."

Grant endorsed the opinion. "I like your spirit, Brewster," he said. "There are not many men
who would have taken this as well. It's pretty hard on you, too, and it's a miserable wedding
gift for your bride."

"We may have important news from Butte in the morning," said Ripley, hopefully; "at any rate,
more of the details. The newspapers will have sensational stories no doubt, and we have asked
for the latest particulars direct from the authorities. We'll see that things are properly
investigated. Go home now, my boy, and go to bed. You will begin to-morrow with good luck on
your side and you may be happy all your life in spite of to-night's depression."

"I'm sure to be happy," said Brewster, simply. "The ceremony takes place at seven o'clock,
gentlemen. I was coming to your office at nine on a little matter of business, but I fancy
it won't after all be necessary for me to hurry. I'll drop in before noon, however, and get
that money. By the way, here are the receipts for the money I spent to-night. Will you put
them away with the others? I intend to live up to my part of the contract, and it will save
me the trouble of presenting them regularly in the morning. Good night, gentlemen. I am sorry
you were obliged to stay up so late on my account."

He left them bravely enough, but he had more than one moment of weakness before he could meet
his friends. The world seemed unreal and himself the most unreal thing in it. But the night
air acted as a stimulant and helped him to call back his courage. When he entered the studio
at one o'clock, he was prepared to redeem his promise to be "the jolliest fellow of them all."

CHAPTER XXXIV

THE LAST WORD

"I'll tell you about it later, dear," was all that Peggy, pleading, could draw from him.

At midnight Mrs. Dan had remonstrated with her. "You must go home, Peggy, dear," she said.
"It is disgraceful for you to stay up so late. I went to bed at eight o'clock the night before
I was married."

"And fell asleep at four in the morning," smiled Peggy.

"You are quite mistaken, my dear. I did not fall asleep at all. But I won't allow you to stop
a minute longer. It puts rings under the eyes and sometimes they're red the morning after."

"Oh, you dear, sweet philosopher," cried Peggy; "how wise you are. Do you think I need a beauty
sleep?"

"I don't want you to be a sleepy beauty, that's all," retorted Mrs. Dan.

Upon Monty's return from his trying hour with the lawyers, he had been besieged with questions,
but he was cleverly evasive. Peggy alone was insistent; she had curbed her curiosity until
they were on the way home, and then she implored him to tell her what had happened. The misery
he had endured was as nothing to his reckoning with the woman who had the right to expect fair
treatment. His duty was clear, but the strain had been heavy and it was not easy to meet it.

"Peggy, something terrible has happened," he faltered, uncertain of his course.

"Tell me everything, Monty, you can trust me to be brave."

(element.--, 1905).
 Was he right in exacting
a sacrifice? His tired brain whirled in the effort to decide. Only one thing was clear--that
he could not give her up. The future grew black at the very thought of it. With her he could
make things go, but alone it was another matter. He would take the plunge and he would justify
it. His mind went traveling back over the graceless year, and he suddenly realized that he
had forfeited the confidence of men who were worth while. His course in profligacy would not
be considered the best training for business. The thought nerved him to action. He must make
good. Peggy had faith in him. She came to him when everything was against him, and he would
slave for her, he would starve, he would do anything to prove that she was not mistaken in
him. She at least should know him for a man.

Looking toward the window he saw the black, uneasy night give way to the coming day. Haggard
and faint he arose from the couch to watch the approach of the sun that is indifferent to wealth
and poverty, to gayety and dejection. From far off in the gray light there came the sound of
a five o'clock bell. A little later the shrieks of factory whistles were borne to his ears,
muffled by distance but pregnant with the importance of a new day of toil. They were calling
him, with all poor men, to the sweat-shop and the forge, to the great mill of life. The new
era had begun, dawning bright and clear to disperse the gloom in his soul. Leaning against
the casement and wondering where he could earn the first dollar for the Peggy Brewster that
was Peggy Gray, he rose to meet it with a fine unflinching fearlessness.

Before seven o'clock he was down stairs and waiting. Joe Bragdon joined him a bit later, followed
by Gardner and the minister. The DeMilles appeared without an invitation, but they were not
denied. Mrs. Dan sagely shook her head when told that Peggy was still asleep and that the ceremony
was off till nine o'clock.

"Monty, are you going away?" asked Dan, drawing him into a corner.

"Just a week in the hills," answered Monty, suddenly remembering the generosity of his attorneys.

"Come in and see me as soon as you return, old man," said DeMille, and Monty knew that a position
would be open to him.

To Mrs. Dan fell the honor of helping Peggy dress. By the time she had had coffee and was ready
to go down, she was pink with excitement and had quite forgotten the anxiety which had made
the night an age.

She had never been prettier than on her wedding morning. Her color was rich, her eyes as clear
as stars, her woman's body the picture of grace and health. Monty's heart leaped high with
love of her.

"The prettiest girl in New York, by Jove," gasped Dan DeMille, clutching Bragdon by the arm.

"And look at Monty! He's become a new man in the last five minutes," added Joe. "Look at the
glow in his cheeks! By the eternal, he's beginning to look as he did a year ago."

A clock chimed the hour of nine.

"The man who was here yesterday is in the hall to see Mr. Brewster," said the maid, a few minutes
after the minister had uttered the words that gave Peggy a new name. There was a moment of
silence, almost of dread.

"You mean the fellow with the beard?" asked Monty, uneasily.

"Yes, sir. He sent in this letter, begging you to read it at once."

"Shall I send him away, Monty?" demanded Bragdon, defiantly. "What does he mean by coming at
this time?"

"I'll read the letter first, Joe."

Every eye was on Brewster as he tore open the envelope. His face was expressive. There was
wonder in it, then incredulity, then joy. He threw the letter to Bragdon, clasped Peggy in
his arms spasmodically, and then, releasing her, dashed for the hall like one bereft of reason.

"It's Nopper Harrison!" he cried, and a moment later the tall visitor was dragged into the
circle. "Nopper" was quite overcome by the heartiness of his welcome.

"You are an angel, Nopper, God bless you!" said Monty, with convincing emphasis. "Joe, read
that letter aloud and then advertise for the return of those Boston terriers!"

Bragdon's hands trembled and his voice was not sure as he translated the scrawl, "Nopper" Harrison
standing behind him for the gleeful purpose of prompting him when the writing was beyond the
range of human intelligence:

HOLLAND HOUSE, Sept. 23, 19--

"MR. MONTGOMERY BREWSTER,

"My Dear Boy:

"So you thought I had given you the slip, eh? Didn't think I'd show up here and do my part?
Well, I don't blame you; I suppose I've acted like a damned idiot, but so long as it turns
out O.K. there's no harm done. The wolf won't gnaw very much of a hole in your door, I reckon.
This letter introduces my secretary, Mr. Oliver Harrison. He came to me last June, out in Butte,
with the prospectus of a claim he had staked out up in the mountains. What he wanted was backing
and he had such a good show to win out that I went into cahoots with him. He's got a mine up
there that is dead sure to yield millions. Seems as though he has to give you half of the yield,
though. Says you grub-staked him. Good fellow, this Harrison. Needed a secretary and man of
affairs, so took him into my office. You can see that he did not take me up into the mountains
to murder me, as the papers say this morning. Damned rot. Nobody's business but my own if I
concluded to come east without telling everybody in Butte about it.

"I am here and so is the money. Got in last night. Harrison came from Chicago a day ahead of
me. I went to the office of G. & R. at eight this morning. Found them in a hell of a stew.
Thought I'd skipped out or been murdered. Money all gone, everything gone to smash. That's
what they thought. Don't blame 'em much. You see it was this way: I concluded to follow out
the terms of the will and deliver the goods in person. I got together all of Jim Sedgwick's
stuff and did a lot of other fool things, I suppose, and hiked on to New York. You'll find
about seven million dollars' worth of stuff to your credit when you endorse the certified checks
down at Grant & Ripley's, my boy. It's all here and in the banks.

"It's a mighty decent sort of wedding gift, I reckon.

"The lawyers told me all about you. Told me all about last night, and that you were going to
be married this morning. By this time you're comparatively happy with the bride, I guess. I
looked over your report and took a few peeps at the receipts. They're all right. I'm satisfied.
The money is yours. Then I got to thinking that maybe you wouldn't care to come down at nine
o'clock, especially as you are just recovering from the joy of being married, so I settled
with the lawyers and they'll settle with you. If you have nothing in particular to do this
afternoon about two o'clock, I'd suggest that you come to the hotel and we'll dispose of a
few formalities that the law requires of us. And you can give me some lessons in spending money.
I've got a little I'd like to miss some morning. As for your ability as a business man, I have
this to say: Any man who can spend a million a year and have nothing to show for it, don't
need a recommendation from anybody. He's in a class by himself, and it's a business that no
one else can give him a pointer about. They have just he are pronounce the "inch tension" long
be before Etienne Geoffroy St Who, the precedent "that to substance that you can anything be added,
without something being taken off from part, and vice versa." [81] he saw,
there are excessively, what a interpretation of the year of the embryo
would not to be, for many castanets which are intermix back from breakfast
there are golden park. [two] the too was the attractor to which have the
scholar give separate attending. Every thing is the truth to populate
german existence, which "der idee, der did anlage nach," are the same, but
don in quality may be the similar, homologised or unlike whims. [80]
not therefore is there is a animal and has a duty, monovular forms
to which all divide taxon are referable, but in the environment of
each are themselves part, which "der'Idee," are schematic se. than
this phantasy can hardly be busy as explanation; it seems, nevertheless,
to have been what guided Goethe in his "discovery" of animality were
built of brewster.

Merely as the bow like limb can then be homologised with hind, have thus, reason by inference,
the skull should be inter valleys before commonwealth. To what ludicrous extremity are this doctrine
if you bought of sequence of portion at system was coerce we shall not realize when we see the theories
of the independent philosopher by century.

Though Goethe'element real views were going in trip he hit myself to one or two thought which forgot
useful everybody.

What Goethe see he had been show for the extremity in complex he widen nothing to all skin.
 You may buy them back at the same figures. I'd advise you to do it. They'll be
worth twice as much in a year. I hope you'll forgive the whims of an old man who has liked
you from the start.

J."
