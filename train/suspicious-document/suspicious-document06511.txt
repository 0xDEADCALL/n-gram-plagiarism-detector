Defeating terrorism in the long run requires that each of these factors be addressed. Effective
democracy provides a counter to each, diminishing the underlying conditions terrorists seek
to exploit.

--In place of alienation, democracy offers an ownership stake in society, a chance to shape
one's own future.

--In place of festering grievances, democracy offers the rule of law, the peaceful resolution
of disputes, and the habits of advancing interests through compromise.

--In place of a culture of conspiracy and misinformation, democracy offers freedom of speech,
independent media, and the marketplace of ideas, which can expose and discredit falsehoods,
prejudices, and dishonest propaganda.

--In place of an ideology that justifies murder, democracy offers a respect for human dignity
that abhors the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians.

Democracy is the antithesis of terrorist tyranny, which is why the terrorists denounce it and
are willing to kill the innocent to stop it. Democracy is based on empowerment, while the terrorists'
ideology is based on enslavement. Democracies expand the freedom of their citizens, while the
terrorists seek to impose a single set of narrow beliefs. Democracy sees individuals as equal
in worth and dignity, having an inherent potential to create, govern themselves, and exercise
basic freedoms of speech and conscience. The terrorists see individuals as objects to be exploited,
and then to be ruled and oppressed.

Democracies are not immune to terrorism. In some democracies, some ethnic or religious groups
are unable or unwilling to grasp the benefits of freedom otherwise available in the society.
Such groups can evidence the same alienation and despair that the transnational terrorists
exploit in undemocratic states. This accounts for the emergence in democratic societies of
homegrown terrorists--even among second- and third-generation citizens. Even in these cases,
the long-term solution remains deepening the reach of democracy so that all citizens enjoy
its benefits. We will continue to guard against the emergence of homegrown terrorists within
our own Homeland as well.

The strategy to counter the lies behind the terrorists' ideology and deny them future recruits
must empower the very people the terrorists most want to exploit: the faithful followers of
Islam. We will continue to support political reforms that empower peaceful Muslims to practice
and interpret their faith. We will work to undermine the ideological underpinnings of violent
Islamic extremism and gain the support of non-violent Muslims around the world. The most vital
work will be done within the Islamic world itself, and Jordan, Morocco, and Indonesia, among
others, have begun to make important strides in this effort. Responsible Islamic leaders need
to denounce an ideology that distorts and exploits Islam to justify the murder of innocent
people and defiles a proud religion.

Many of the Muslim faith are already making this commitment at great personal risk. They realize
they are a target of this ideology of terror. Everywhere we have joined in the fight against
terrorism, Muslim allies have stood beside us, becoming partners in this vital cause. They
know the stakes--the survival of their own liberty, the future of their own region, the justice
and humanity of their own traditions--and the United States is proud to stand beside them.
Not only will we continue to support the efforts of our Muslim partners overseas to reject
violent extremism, we will continue to engage with and strengthen the efforts of Muslims within
the United States as well. Through outreach programs and public diplomacy we will reveal the
terrorists' violent extremist ideology for what it is--a form of totalitarianism following
in the path of fascism and Nazism.

+Over the short term: Four priorities of action+

The advance of freedom, opportunity, and human dignity through democracy is the long-term solution
to the transnational terror movement of today. To create the space and time for this long-term
solution to take root, we are operating along four priorities of action in the short term.

--+Disrupt the flow of resources from rogue states to terrorists+. Until we can eliminate state
sponsorship of terror, we will disrupt and deny the flow of support from states to terrorists.
We will continue to create and strengthen international will to interdict material support,
akin to our efforts in the Proliferation Security Initiative--a global effort to stop shipments
of WMD, their delivery systems, and related material. We will build international cooperation
to financially isolate rogue states and their terrorist proxies. We also will continue to expose
the vehicles and fronts that states use to support their terrorist surrogates. Our terrorist
enemies are striving to claim a strategic country as a haven for terror. From this base, they
could destabilize the Middle East and strike America and other free nations with everincreasing
violence. This we can never allow. Our enemies had established a sanctuary in Afghanistan prior
to Operation Enduring Freedom, and today terrorists see Iraq as the central front of their
fight against the United States. This is why success in helping the Afghan and Iraqi peoples
forge effective democracies is vital. We will continue to prevent terrorists from exploiting
ungoverned or under-governed areas as safehavens--secure spaces that allow our enemies to plan,
organize, train, and prepare for operations. Ultimately, we will eliminate these havens altogether.

--+Eliminate physical safehavens+. Physical sanctuaries can stretch across an entire sovereign
state, be limited to specific ungoverned or ill-governed areas in an otherwise functioning
state, or cross national borders. In some cases the government wants to exercise greater effective
sovereignty over its lands and maintain control within its borders but lacks the necessary
capacity. We will strengthen the capacity of such War on Terror partners to reclaim full control
of their territory through effective police, border, and other security forces as well as functioning
systems of justice. To further counter terrorist exploitation of under-governed lands, we will
promote effective economic development to help ensure long-term stability and prosperity. In
failing states or states emerging from conflict, the risks are significant. Spoilers can take
advantage of instability to create conditions terrorists can exploit. We will continue to work
with foreign partners and international organizations to help prevent conflict and respond
to state failure by building foreign capacity for peace operations, reconstruction, and stabilization
so that countries in transition can reach a sustainable path to peace, democracy, and prosperity.
Where physical havens cross national boundaries, we will continue to work with the affected
countries to help establish effective cross-border control. Yet some countries will be reluctant
to fulfill their sovereign responsibilities to combat terrorist-related activities within their
borders. In addition to cooperation and sustained diplomacy, we will continue to partner with
the international community to persuade states to meet their obligations to combat terrorism
and deny safehaven under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373.

Yet safehavens are not just limited to geographic territories. They also can be non-physical
or virtual, existing within legal, cyber, and financial systems.

--+Legal safehavens+. Some legal systems lack adequate procedural, substantive, and international
assistance laws that enable effective investigation, prosecution, and extradition of terrorists.
Such gaps offer a haven in which terrorists and their organizations can operate free from fear
of prosecution. In the United States we have developed a domestic legal system that supports
effective investigation and prosecution of terrorist activities while preserving individual
privacy, the First Amendment rights of association, religious freedom, free speech, and other
civil rights. We will continue to work with foreign partners to build their legal capacity
to investigate, prosecute, and assist in the foreign prosecution of the full range of terrorist
activities--from provision of material support to conspiracy to operational planning to a completed
act of terrorism.

--+Cyber safehavens+. Most idea is not that by our dint will truly take.

 Twelve universal conventions and protocols in force against terrorism
have been developed under the auspices of the United Nations as well as various U.N. Security
Council Resolutions related to combating terror. These include UNSCR 1373, which imposes binding
obligations on all states to suppress and prevent terrorist financing, improve their border
controls, enhance information sharing and law enforcement cooperation, suppress the recruitment
of terrorists, and deny them sanctuary.

The Group of Eight (G-8) along with other multilateral and regional bodies also have been instrumental
in developing landmark counterterrorism standards and best practices that have been adopted
by international standard-setting organizations. And he break float of we will today seek this

 This includes significantly expanding Special
Operations Forces, increasing the capabilities of its general purpose forces to conduct irregular
warfare operations, and initiating the largest rearrangement of its global force posture since
the end of World War II.

The Department of State is implementing a new framework for foreign assistance to establish
more integrated and coherent strategic direction and tactical plans to meet our current and
longterm challenges, including terrorism. The State Department also is repositioning its domestic
and overseas staff to better promote America's policies and interests and have more direct
local and regional impact. This transformational diplomacy positions State to work with partners
around the world to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to
the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.

We will sustain the transformation already under way in these and other departments and agencies.
Moreover, we will continue to build and strengthen a unified team across the counterterrorism
community, and a key component of this effort will be fostering "jointness." Where practicable,
we will increase interagency and intergovernmental assignments for personnel in counterterrorism-related
positions. This will help to break down organizational stovepipes and advance the exchange
of ideas and practices for more effective counterterrorism efforts.
