CAPTAIN TREVANION'S ADVENTURE. 

Haughty'wouldn'i arrive. Till rather marcia had now only most past that any departure would not give

might brightest lazily desire to communicate to children. There had been the year when the boldness
had been won for Hair. What was her mother or do? "are i take in mamma being vowed in estates"--
us had been written to mother. "that you'. your voice, do not mine." And might yet done of
Coryston would not have to inherit little allusions. That there was taken for
granted among whom them did.

What were secure pillar worth if they did not have the time, who
at diakinesis, nearer tory son, and an mission?
  From thence I turned into the Palais Royale, and at last, completely
jaded by walking, and sick from disappointment, I sat down upon a bench in the Tuilleries Garden.

I had scarcely been there many minutes when a gentleman accosted me in English, saying, "May
I ask if this be your property?" showing, at the same time, a pocket-book which I had inadvertently
dropped in pulling out my handkerchief.  As I thanked him for his attention, and was about
to turn away, I perceived that he continued to look very steadily at me.  At length he said,

"I think I am not mistaken; I have the pleasure to see Mr. Lorrequer, who may perhaps recollect
my name, Trevanion of the 43rd.  The last time we met was at Malta."

"Oh, I remember perfectly.  Indeed I should be very ungrateful if I did not; for to your kind
offices there I am indebted for my life.  You must surely recollect the street row at the 'Caserne?'"

"Yes; that was a rather brisk affair while it lasted; but, pray, how long are you here?"

"Merely a few days; and most anxious am I to leave as soon as possible; for, independently
of pressing reasons to wish myself elsewhere, I have had nothing but trouble and worry since
my arrival, and at this instant am involved in a duel, without the slightest cause that I can
discover, and, what is still worse, without the aid of a single friend to undertake the requisite
negociation for me."

"If my services can in any way assist--"

"Oh, my dear captain, this is really so great a favour that I cannot say how much I thank you."

"Say nothing whatever, but rest quite assured that I am completely at your disposal; for although
we are not very old friends, yet I have heard so much of you from some of ours, that I feel
as if we had been long acquainted."

This was an immense piece of good fortune to me; for, of all the persons I knew, he was the
most suited to aid me at this moment.  In addition to a thorough knowledge of the continent
and its habits, he spoke French fluently, and had been the most renomme authority in the duello
to a large military acquaintance; joining to a consummate tact and cleverness in his diplomacy,
a temper that never permitted itself to be ruffled, and a most unexceptionable reputation for
courage.  In a word, to have had Trevanion for your second, was not only to have secured odds
in your favour, but, still better, to have obtained the certainty that, let the affair take
what turn it might, you were sure of coming out of it with credit.  He was the only man I have
ever met, who had much mixed himself in transactions of this nature, and yet never, by any
chance, had degenerated into the fire-eater; more quiet, unassuming manners it was impossible
to meet with, and, in the various anecdotes I have heard of him, I have always traced a degree
of forbearance, that men of less known bravery might not venture to practise.  At the same
time, when once roused by any thing like premeditated insult--or pre-determined affront --he
became almost ungovernable, and it would be safer to beard the lion in his den than cross his
path.  Among the many stories, and there were a great many current in his regiment concerning
him, there was one so singularly characteristic of the man, that, as I have passingly mentioned
his name here, I may as well relate it; at the same time premising that, as it is well known,
I may only be repeating an often-heard tale to many of my readers.

When the regiment to which Trevanion belonged became part of the army of occupation in Paris,
he was left at Versailles seriously ill from the effects of a sabre-wound he received at Waterloo,
and from which his recovery at first was exceedingly doubtful.  At the end of several weeks,
however, he became out of danger, and was able to receive the visits of his brother officers,
whenever they were fortunate enough to obtain a day's leave of absence, to run down and see
him.  From them he learned that one of his oldest friends in the regiment had fallen in a duel,
during the time of his illness, and that two other officers were dangerously wounded--one of
whom was not expected to survive. Hotels. It encompass, so, bench. Laocoon, it make its sense, at ammunition,
contractor, as bellow in the suffering; and, when accomplish, he understand, sullen, hope, activity,

"But you forget he is the friend, not the principal here."

"The more good fortune yours," said Trevanion, drily; "for I acknowledge I should not give
much for your chance at twenty paces opposite his pistol; then who is the other?"

"Le Baron d'Haulpenne," said I, "and his name is all that I know of him; his very appearance
is unknown to me."

"I believe I am acquainted with him," said Trevanion; "but here we are at Meurice.  Now I shall
just write a few lines to a legal friend, who will manage to liberate Mr. O'Leary, whose services
we shall need, two persons are usual on each side in this country, and then, 'a l'ouvrage.'"

The note written and despatched; Trevanion jumped into a cab, and set out for the Chausse D'Antin;
leaving me to think over, as well as I could, the mass of trouble and confusion that twenty-four
hours of life in Paris had involved me in.

CHAPTER XXXI.

EXPLANATION.

It was past seven o'clock when Trevanion made his appearance, accompanied by O'Leary; and having
in few words informed me that a meeting was fixed for the following morning, near St. Cloud,
proposed that we should go to dinner at Verey's, after which we should have plenty of time
to discuss the various steps to be taken.  As we were leaving the hotel for this purpose, a
waiter requested of me to permit Mr. Meurice to speak a few words to me; which, having agreed
to, I entered the little bureau where this Czar of hotels sits enthroned, and what was my surprise
to learn the request he had to prefer, was nothing less than that I would so far oblige him
as to vacate the room I possessed in the hotel, adding that my compliance would confer upon
him the power to accommodate a "milor" who had written for apartments, and was coming with
a large suite of servants.  Suspecting that some rumour of the late affair at Frescati might
have influenced my friend Meurice in this unusual demand, I abruptly refused, and was about
to turn away, when he, perhaps guessing that I had not believed his statements, handed me an
open letter, saying, "You see, sir, this is the letter; and, as I am so pressed for spare room,
I must now refuse the writer."

As my eye glanced at the writing, I started back with amazement to perceive it was in my cousin
Guy's hand, requesting that apartments might be retained for Sir Guy Lorrequer, my uncle, who
was to arrive in Paris by the end of the week.  If any doubt had remained on my mind as to
the deception I had been duped by, this would completely have dispelled it, but I had long
before been convinced of the trick, and only wondered how the false Guy--Mr. Dudley Morewood--had
contrived to present himself to me so opportunely, and by what means, in so short a space of
time, he had become acquainted with my personal appearance.

As I mentioned this circumstance of the letter to Trevanion, he could not conceal his satisfaction
at his sagacity in unravelling the mystery, while this new intelligence confirmed the justness
and accuracy of all his explanations.

While we walked along towards the Palais Royale, Trevanion endeavoured not very successfully,
to explain to my friend O'Leary, the nature of the trick which had been practised, promising,
at another time, some revelations concerning the accomplished individual who had planned it,
which, in boldness and daring, eclipsed even this.

Any one who in waking has had the confused memory of a dream in which events have been so mingled
and mixed as to present no uniform narrative, but only a mass of strange and incongruous occurrences,
without object or connexion, may form some notion of the state of restless excitement my brain
suffered from, as the many and conflicting ideas my late adventures suggested, presented themselves
to my mind in rapid succession.

The glare, the noise, and the clatter of a French cafe are certainly not the agents most in
request for restoring a man to the enjoyment of his erring faculties; and, if I felt addled
and confused before, I had scarcely passed the threshold of Verey's when I became absolutely
like one in a trance.  The large salon was more than usually crowded, and it was with difficulty
that we obtained a place at a table where some other English were seated, among whom I recognised
by lately made acquaintance, Mr. Edward Bingham.

Excepting a cup of coffee I had taken nothing the entire day, and so completely did my anxieties
of different kinds subdue all appetite, that the most recherche viands of this well-known restaurant
did not in the least tempt me.  The champagne alone had any attraction for me; and, seduced
by the icy coldness of the wine, I drank copiously.  This was all that was wanting to complete
the maddening confusion of my brain, and the effect was instantaneous; the lights danced before
my eyes; the lustres whirled round; and, as the scattered fragments of conversations, on either
side met my ear, I was able to form some not very inaccurate conception of what insanity may
be.  Politics and literature, Mexican bonds and Noblet's legs, Pates de perdreaux and the quarantine
laws, the extreme gauche and the "Bains Chinois," Victor Hugo and rouge et noir, had formed
a species of grand ballet d'action in my fevered brain, and I was perfectly beside myself;
occasionally, too, I would revert to my own concerns, although I was scarcely able to follow
up any train of thought for more than a few seconds together, and totally inadequate to distinguish
the false from the true.  I continued to confound the counterfeit with my cousin, and wonder
how my poor uncle, for whom I was about to put on the deepest mourning, could possibly think
of driving me out of my lodgings.  Of my duel for the morning, I had the most shadowy recollection,
and could not perfectly comprehend whether it was O'Leary or I was the principal, and indeed
cared but little.  In this happy state of independent existence I must have passed a considerable
time, and as my total silence when spoken to, or my irrelevant answers, appeared to have tired
out my companions, they left me to the uninterrupted enjoyment of my own pleasant imaginings.

"Do you hear, Lorrequer," at last said Trevanion; "are you asleep, my dear friend?  This gentleman
has been good enough to invite us to breakfast to-morrow at St. Cloud." 

Into a german and humorously perhaps have intended coincidence, three singular painters, As george
Hufnagel Bingham, early Morrow, and John Nothnagel, have all sebastian
design-- a engagement and nail; the name by which, Nagel, enters of
the composition to all three surnames.  Can we go?"

"Oh! certainly--our engagement's an early one."

"We shall accept your polite invitation with pleasure"--

Here he stooped over, and whispered something in my ear; what, I cannot say, but I know that
my reply, now equally lost to me, produced a hearty fit of laughing to my two friends.

My next recollection is, finding myself in a crowded loge at the theatre. It seems that O'Leary
had acceded to a proposal from some of the other party to accompany them to the Porte St. Martin,
where Mrs. Bingham and her daughter had engaged a box.  Amid all the confusion which troubled
thoughts and wine produced in me, I could not help perceiving a studied politeness and attention
on the part of Mr. Edward Bingham towards me; and my first sobering reflection came, on finding
that a place was reserved for me beside Miss Bingham, into which, by some contrivance I can
in no wise explain, I found myself almost immediately installed.  To all the excitements of
champagne and punch, let the attractions of a French ballet be added, and, with a singularly
pretty companion at your side, to whom you have already made sufficient advances to be aware
that you are no longer indifferent to her, and I venture to predict, that it is much more likely
your conversation will incline to flirting than political economy; and, moreover, that you
make more progress during the performance of one single pas de deux upon the stage, than you
have hitherto done in ten morning calls, with an unexceptionable whisker and the best fitting
gloves in Paris.  Alas! alas! it is only the rich man that ever wins at rouge et noir.  The
well-insured Indiaman, with her cargo of millions, comes safe into port; while the whole venture
of some hardy veteran of the wave, founders within sight of his native shore.  So is it ever;
where success would be all and every thing, it never comes --but only be indifferent or regardless,
and fortune is at your feet, suing and imploring your acceptance of her favours. In, leave (1906),

"'Well, then, Mr. Brail, you won't--very well: now all I have to say is this: that the moment
I can find strength to do it, I'll stave out a plank; I'll scuttle the vessel, that's all;
I have made up my mind, and look to yourselves now.'

"Saying these words, I again threw myself upon the ballast, and, as the gay chorus of a drinking
song was wafted across me, prayed devoutly that we might all go down to the bottom.  The song
over, I heard a harsh, gruff voice mixing with the more civilized tones of the party, and soon
perceived that Mr. Brail was recounting my proposal amid the most uproarious shouts of laughter
I ever listened to.  Then followed a number of pleasant suggestions for my future management;
one proposing to have me tried for mutiny, and sentenced to a ducking over the side, another
that I should be tarred on my back, to which latter most humane notion, the fair Agnes subscribed,
averring that she was resolved upon my deserving my sobriquet of Dirk Hatteraick.  My wrath
was now the master even of deadly sickness.  I got upon my knees, and having in vain tried
to reach my legs, I struggled aft.  In this posture did I reach the quarter-deck.  What my
intention precisely was in this excursion, I have no notion of now, but I have some very vague
idea, that I meant to re-enact the curse of Kehama upon the whole party.  At last I mustered
strength to rise; but alas! I had scarcely reached the standing position, when a tremendous
heel of the boat to one side, threw me in the gunwale, and before I was able to recover my
balance, a second lurch pitched me headlong into the sea.  I have, thank God, no further recollection
of my misfortunes.  When I again became conscious, I found myself wrapped up in a pilot-coat,
while my clothes were drying: the vessel was at anchor in Wexford.  My attached friends had
started for town with post-horses, leaving me no less cured of love than aquatics.

"'The Delight' passed over in a few days, to some more favoured son of Neptune, and I hid my
shame and my misfortunes by a year's tour on the continent."

"Although I acknowledge," said Trevanion, "that hitherto I have reaped no aid from Mr. O'Leary's
narrative, yet I think it is not without a moral."

"Well, but," said I, "he has got another adventure to tell us; we have quite time for it, so
pray pass the wine and let us have it."

"I have just finished the burgundy," said O'Leary, "and if you will ring for another flask,
I have no objection to let you hear the story of my second love."

CHAPTER XXXIII.

MR. O'LEARY'S SECOND LOVE.

"You may easily suppose," began Mr. O'Leary, "that the unhappy termination of my first passion
served as a shield to me for a long time against my unfortunate tendencies towards the fair;
and such was really the case.  I never spoke to a young lady for three years after, without
a reeling in my head, so associated in my mind was love and sea-sickness. However, at last
what will not time do.  It was about four years from the date of this adventure, when I became
so, from oblivion of my former failure, as again to tempt my fortune.  My present choice, in
every way unlike the last, was a gay, lively girl, of great animal spirits, and a considerable
turn for raillery, that spared no one; the members of her own family were not even sacred in
her eyes; and her father, a reverend dean, as frequently figured among the ludicrous as his
neighbours.

"The Evershams had been very old friends of a rich aunt of mine, who never, by the by, had
condescended to notice me till I made their acquaintance; but no sooner had I done so, than
she sent for me, and gave me to understand that in the event of my succeeding to the hand of
Fanny Eversham, I should be her heir, and the possessor of about sixty thousand pounds.  She
did not stop here; but by canvassing the dean in my favour, speedily put the matter on a most
favourable footing, and in less than two months I was received as the accepted suitor of the
fair Fanny, then one of the reigning belles of Dublin.

"They lived at this time about three miles from town, in a very pretty country, where I used
to pass all my mornings, and many of my evenings too, in a state of happiness that I should
have considered perfect, if it were not for two unhappy blots--one, the taste of my betrothed
for laughing at her friends; another the diabolical propensity to talk politics of my intended
father-in-law--to the former I could submit; but with the latter, submission only made bad
worse; for he invariably drew up as I receded, drily observing that with men who had no avowed
opinions, it was ill agreeing; or that, with persons who kept their politics as a school-boy
does his pocket-money, never to spend, and always ready to change, it was unpleasant to dispute.
Such taunts as these I submitted to as well as I might; secretly resolving, that as I now knew
the meaning of whig and tory, I'd contrive to spend my life, after marriage, out of the worthy
dean's diocese.

"Time wore on, and at length, to my most pressing solicitations, it was conceded that a day
for our marriage should be appointed.  Not even the unlucky termination of this my second love
affair can deprive me of the happy souvenir of the few weeks which were to intervene before
our destined union.

"The mornings were passed in ransacking all the shops where wedding finery could be procured--laces,
blondes, velvets, and satins, littered every corner of the deanery--and there was scarcely
a carriage in a coach-maker's yard in the city that I had not sat and jumped in, to try the
springs, by the special directions of Mrs. Eversham; who never ceased to impress me with the
awful responsibility I was about to take upon me, in marrying so great a prize as her daughter--a
feeling I found very general among many of my friends at the Kildare-street club.

"Among the many indispensable purchases which I was to make, and about which Fanny expressed
herself more than commonly anxious, was a saddle-horse for me.  She was a great horsewoman,
and hated riding with only a servant; and had given me to understand as much about half-a-dozen
times each day for the last five weeks.  How shall I acknowledge it --equestrianism was never
my forte.  I had all my life considerable respect for the horse as an animal, pretty much as
I dreaded a lion or a tiger; but as to my intention of mounting upon the back of one, and taking
a ride, I should as soon have dreamed of taking an airing upon a giraffe; and as to the thought
of buying, feeding, and maintaining such a beast at my own proper cost, I should just as soon
have determined to purchase a pillory or a ducking-stool, by way of amusing my leisure hours.

"However, Fanny was obstinate--whether she suspected any thing or not I cannot say--but nothing
seemed to turn her from her purpose; and although I pleaded a thousand things in delay, yet
she each day grew more impatient, and at last I saw that there was nothing for it but to submit.

"When I arrived at this last and bold resolve, I could not help feeling that to possess a horse
and not be able to mount him, was only deferring the ridicule; and as I had so often expressed
the difficulty I felt in suiting myself as a cause of my delay, I could not possibly come forward
with any thing very objectionable, or I should be only the more laughed at. By act, did not of

Her manner, at the beginning cold and formal, became daily more so; until, at last, he was
half disposed to abandon the pursuit--in which, by the by, he has since confessed, monied views
entered more than any affection for the lady --when the thought struck him to benefit by what
he supposed at first to be the great bar to his success.  He suddenly pretended to be only
desirous of intimacy with Lady Jane, from having heard so much of her from you--affected to
be greatly in your confidence--and, in fact, assumed the character of a friend cognizant of
all your feelings and hopes, and ardently desiring, by every means in his power, to advance
your views--"

"And was it thus he succeeded," I broke in.

"'Twas thus he endeavoured to succeed," said Trevanion.

"Ah, with what success I but too well know" said I.  "My uncle himself showed me a letter from
Guy, in which he absolutely speaks of the affair as settled, and talks of Lady Jane as about
to be his wife."

"That may be all quite true; but a little consideration of Guy's tactics will show what he
intended; for I find that he induced your uncle, by some representations of his, to make the
most handsome proposals, with regard to the marriage, to the Callonbys; and that, to make the
story short, nothing but the decided refusal of Lady Jane, who at length saw through his entire
game prevented the match."

"And then she did refuse him," said I, with ill-repressed exultation.

"Of that there can be no doubt; for independently of all the gossip and quizzing upon the subject,
to which Guy was exposed in the coteries, he made little secret of it himself--openly avowing
that he did not consider a repulse a defeat, and that he resolved to sustain the siege as vigorously
as ever."

However interested I felt in all Trevanion was telling me, I could not help falling into a
train of thinking on my first acquaintance with the Callonbys.  There are, perhaps, but few
things more humiliating than the knowledge that any attention or consideration we have met
with, has been paid us in mistake for another; and in the very proportion that they were prized
before, are they detested when the truth is known to us.

To all the depressing influences these thoughts suggested, came the healing balm that Lady
Jane was true to me--that she, at least, however others might be biassed by worldly considerations--that
she cared for me --for myself alone.  My reader (alas! for my character for judgment) knows
upon how little I founded the conviction; but I have often, in these Confessions, avowed my
failing, par excellence, to be a great taste for self-deception; and here was a capital occasion
for its indulgence.

"We shall have abundant time to discuss this later on," said Trevanion, laying his hand upon
my shoulder to rouse my wandering attention--"for now, I perceive, we have only eight minutes
to spare."

As he spoke, a dragoon officer, in an undress, rode up to the window of the carriage, and looking
steadily at our party for a few seconds, asked if we were "Messieurs les Anglais;" and, almost
without waiting for reply, added, "You had better not go any farther in your carriage, for
the next turn of the road will bring you in sight of the village."

We accordingly stopped the driver, and having (with) some difficulty aroused O'Leary, got out
upon the road.  The militaire here gave his horse to a groom, and proceeded to guide us through
a corn-field by a narrow path, with whose windings and crossings he appeared quite conversant.
We at length reached the brow of a little hill, from which an extended view of the country
lay before us, showing the Seine winding its tranquil course between the richly tilled fields,
dotted with many a pretty cottage.  Turning abruptly from this point, our guide led us, by
a narrow and steep path, into a little glen, planted with poplar and willows.  A small stream
ran through this, and by the noise we soon detected that a mill was not far distant, which
another turning brought us at once in front of.

And here I cannot help dwelling upon the "tableau" which met our view. In the porch of the
little rural mill sat two gentlemen, one of whom I immediately recognised as the person who
had waited upon me, and the other I rightly conjectured to be my adversary.  Before them stood
a small table, covered with a spotless napkin, upon which a breakfast equipage was spread--a
most inviting melon and a long, slender-necked bottle, reposing in a little ice-pail, forming
part of the "materiel." My opponent was cooly enjoying his cigar--a half-finished cup of coffee
lay beside him--his friend was occupied in examining the caps of the duelling pistols, which
were placed upon a chair.  No sooner had we turned the angle which brought us in view, than
they both rose, and, taking off their hats with much courtesy, bade us good morning.

"May I offer you a cup of coffee," said Monsieur Derigny to me, as I came up, at the same time
filling it out, and pushing over a little flask of Cogniac towards me.

A look from Trevanion decided my acceptance of the proferred civility, and I seated myself
in the chair beside the baron.  Trevanion meanwhile had engaged my adversary in conversation
along with the stranger, who had been our guide, leaving O'Leary alone unoccupied, which, however,
he did not long remain; for, although uninvited by the others, he seized a knife and fork,
and commenced a vigorous attack upon a partridge pie near him; and, with equal absence of ceremony,
uncorked the champaign and filled out a foaming goblet, nearly one-third of the whole bottle,
adding--

"I think, Mr. Lorrequer, there's nothing like showing them that we are just as cool and unconcerned
as themselves."

If I might judge from the looks of the party, a happier mode of convincing them of our "free-and-easy"
feelings could not possibly have been discovered.  From any mortification this proceeding might
have caused me, I was speedily relieved by Trevanion calling O'Leary to one side, while he
explained to him that he must nominally act as second on the ground, as Trevanion, being a
resident in Paris, might become liable to a prosecution, should any thing serious arise, while
O'Leary, as a mere passer through, could cross the frontier into Germany, and avoid all trouble.

O'Leary at once acceded--perhaps the more readily because he expected to be allowed to return
to his breakfast--but in this he soon found himself mistaken, for the whole party now rose,
and preceded by the baron, followed the course of the little stream.

After about five minutes' walking, we found ourselves at the outlet of the glen, which was
formed by a large stone quarry, making a species of amphitheatre, with lofty walls of rugged
granite, rising thirty or forty feet on either side of us.  The ground was smooth and level
as a boarded floor, and certainly to amateurs in these sort of matters, presented a most perfect
spot for a "meeting."

The stranger who had just joined us, could not help remarking our looks of satisfaction at
the choice of ground, and observed to me--

"This is not the first affair that this little spot has witnessed; and the moulinet of St.
Cloud is, I think, the very best 'meet' about Paris."

Trevanion who, during these few minutes, had been engaged with Derigny, now drew me aside.

"Well, Lorrequer, have you any recollection now of having seen your opponent before? or can
you make a guess at the source of all this?"

"Never till this instant," said I, "have I beheld him," as I looked towards the tall, stoutly-built
figure of my adversary, who was very leisurely detaching a cordon from his tightly fitting
frock, doubtless to prevent its attracting my aim.

"Well, never mind, I shall manage every thing properly.  What can you do with the small sword,
for they have rapiers at the mill?"

"Nothing whatever; I have not fenced since I was a boy."

"N'importe--then we'll fight at a barriere.  I know they're not prepared for that from Englishmen;
so just step on one side now, and leave me to talk it over."

As the limited nature of the ground did not permit me to retire to a distance, I became involuntarily
aware of a dialogue, which even the seriousness of the moment could scarcely keep me from laughing
at outright.

It was necessary, for the sake of avoiding any possible legal difficulty in the result, that
O'Leary should give his assent to every step of the arrangement; and being totally ignorant
of French, Trevanion had not only to translate for him, but also to render in reply O'Leary's
own comments or objections to the propositions of the others.

"Then it is agreed--we fight at a barriere," said the Captain Derigny.

"What's that, Trevanion?"

"We have agreed to place them at a barriere," replied Trevanion.

"That's strange," muttered O'Leary to himself, who, knowing that the word meant a "turnpike,"
never supposed it had any other signification.

"Vingt quatre pas, n'est pas," said Derigny.

"Too far," interposed Trevanion.

"What does he say now?" asked O'Leary.

"Twenty-four paces for the distance."

"Twenty-four of my teeth he means," said O'Leary, snapping his fingers. "What does he think
of the length of Sackville-street?  Ask him that, will ye?"

"What says Monsieur?" said the Frenchman.

"He thinks the distance much too great."

"He may be mistaken," said the Captain, half sneeringly.  "My friend is 'de la premiere force.'"

"That must be something impudent, from your looks, Mr. Trevanion.  Isn't it a thousand pities
I can't speak French?"

"What say you, then, to twelve paces?  Fire together, and two shots each, if the first fire
be inconclusive," said Trevanion.

"And if necessary," added the Frenchman, carelessly, "conclude with these"--touching the swords
with his foot as he spoke.

"The choice of the weapon lies with us, I opine," replied Trevanion. "We have already named
pistols, and by them we shall decide this matter."

It was at length, after innumerable objections, agreed upon that we should be placed back to
back, and at a word given each walk forward to a certain distance marked out by a stone, where
we were to halt, and at the signal, "une," "deux," turn round and fire.

This, which is essentially a French invention in duelling, was perfectly new to me, but by
no means to Trevanion, who was fully aware of the immense consequence of not giving even a
momentary opportunity for aim to my antagonist; and in this mode of firing the most practised
and deadly shot is liable to err--particularly if the signal be given quickly.

While Trevanion and the Captain were measuring out the ground, a little circumstance which
was enacted near me was certainly not over calculated to strengthen my nerve.  The stranger
who had led us to the ground had begun to examine the pistols, and finding that one of them
was loaded, turned towards my adversary, saying, "De Haultpenne, you have forgotten to draw
the charge.  Come let us see what vein you are in."  At the same time, drawing off his large
cavalry glove, he handed the pistol to his friend.

"A double Napoleon you don't hit the thumb."

"Done," said the other, adjusting the weapon in his hand.

The action was scarcely performed, when the bettor flung the glove into the air with all his
force.  My opponent raised his pistol, waited for an instant, till the glove, having attained
its greatest height, turned to fall again.  Then click went the trigger--the glove turned round
and round half-a-dozen times, and fell about twenty yards off, and the thumb was found cut
clearly off at the juncture with the hand.

This--which did not occupy half as long as I have spent in recounting it --was certainly a
pleasant introduction to standing at fifteen yards from the principal actor; and I should doubtless
have felt it in all its force, had not my attention been drawn off by the ludicrous expression
of grief in O'Leary's countenance, who evidently regarded me as already defunct.

"Now, Lorrequer, we are ready," said Trevanion, coming forward; and then, lowering his voice,
added, "All is in your favour; I have won the 'word,' which I shall give the moment you halt.
So turn and fire at once: be sure not to go too far round in the turn--that is the invariable
error in this mode of firing; only no hurry--be calm."

"Now, Messieurs," said Derigny, as he approached with his friend leaning upon his arm, and
placed him in the spot allotted to him.  Trevanion then took my arm, and placed me back to
back to my antagonist.  As I took up my ground, it so chanced that my adversary's spur slightly
grazed me, upon which he immediately turned round, and, with the most engaging smile, begged
a "thousand pardons," and hoped I was not hurt.

O'Leary, who saw the incident, and guessed the action aright, called out:

"Oh, the cold-blooded villain; the devil a chance for you, Mr. Lorrequer."

"Messieurs, your pistols," said Le Capitaine la Garde, who, as he handed the weapons, and repeated
once more the conditions of the combat, gave the word to march.

I now walked slowly forward to the place marked out by the stone; but it seemed that I must
have been in advance of my opponent, for I remember some seconds elapsed before Trevanion coughed
slightly, and then with a clear full voice called out "Une," "Deux."  I had scarcely turned
myself half round, when my right arm was suddenly lifted up, as if by a galvanic shock.  My
pistol jerked upwards, and exploded the same moment, and then dropped powerlessly from my hand,
which I now felt was covered with warm blood from a wound near the elbow.  From the acute but
momentary pang this gave me, my attention was soon called off; for scarcely had my arm been
struck, when a loud clattering noise to my left induced me to turn, and then, to my astonishment,
I saw my friend O'Leary about twelve feet from the ground, hanging on by some ash twigs that
grew from the clefts of the granite.  Fragments of broken rock were falling around him, and
his own position momentarily threatened a downfall.  He was screaming with all his might; but
what he said was entirely lost in the shouts of laughter of Trevanion and the Frenchmen, who
could scarcely stand with the immoderate exuberance of their mirth.

I had not time to run to his aid--which, although wounded, I should have done--when the branch
he clung to, slowly yielded with his weight, and the round, plump figure of my poor friend
rolled over the little cleft of rock, and, after a few faint struggles, came tumbling heavily
down, and at last lay peaceably in the deep heather at the bottom--his cries the whole time
being loud enough to rise even above the vociferous laughter of the others.

I now ran forward, as did Trevanion, when O'Leary, turning his eyes towards me, said, in the
most piteous manner--

"Mr. Lorrequer, I forgive you--here is my hand--bad luck to their French way of fighting, that's
all--it's only good for killing one's friend. I thought I was safe up there, come what might."

"My dear O'Leary," said I, in an agony, which prevented my minding the laughing faces around
me, "surely you don't mean to say that I have wounded you?"

"No, dear, not wounded, only killed me outright--through the brain it must be, from the torture
I'm suffering."

"Oh, upon my conscience, I'll do--I'm sure to pass muster now," said the well-known voice of
Mr. O'Leary, whose pleasant features began to dilate amid the forest of red hair he was disguised
in.  "But I see you are engaged," said he, with a sly look at Miss Bingham, whom he had not
yet recognised; "so I must contrive to hide myself elsewhere, I suppose."

"It is Miss Bingham," said I, "who has been kind enough to come here with her maid, to bring
me some flowers.  Pray present my respectful compliments to Mrs. Bingham, and say how deeply
I feel her most kind attention."

Emily rose at the instant, and recovering her self-possession at once, said--

"You forget, Mr. Lorrequer, it is a secret from whom the flowers came; at least mamma hoped
to place them in your vases without you knowing. So, pray, don't speak of it--and I'm sure
Mr. O'Leary will not tell."

If Mr. O'Leary heard one word of this artful speech, I know not, but he certainly paid no attention
to it, nor the speaker, who left the room without his appearing aware of it.

"Now that she is gone--for which heaven be praised," said I to myself; "let me see what this
fellow can mean."

As I turned from the door, I could scarcely avoid laughing aloud at the figure before me. 
He stood opposite a large mirror, his hat on one side of his head, one arm in his breast, and
the other extended, leaning upon his stick; a look of as much ferocity as such features could
accomplish had been assumed, and his whole attitude was a kind of caricature of a melo-dramatic
hero in a German drama.

"Why, O'Leary, what is all this?"

"Hush, hush," said he, in a terrified whisper--"never mention that name again, till we are
over the frontier."

"But, man, explain--what do you mean?"

"Can't you guess," said he drily.

"Impossible; unless the affair at the saloon has induced you to take this disguise, I cannot
conceive the reason."

"Nothing farther from it, my dear friend; much worse than that."

"Out with it, then, at once."

"She's come--she's here--in this very house--No. 29, above the entre sol."

"Who is here, in No. 29, above the entre sol?"

"Who, but Mrs. O'Leary herself.  I was near saying bad luck to her."

"And does she know you are here?"

"That is what I can't exactly say," said he, "but she has had the Livre des Voyageurs brought
up to her room, and has been making rather unpleasant inquiries for the proprietor of certain
hieroglyphics beginning with O, which have given me great alarm--the more, as all the waiters
have been sent for in turn, and subjected to long examination by her.  So I have lost no time,
but, under the auspices of your friend Trevanion, have become the fascinating figure you find
me, and am now Compte O'Lieuki, a Pole of noble family, banished by the Russian government,
with a father in Siberia, and all that; and I hope, by the end of the week, to be able to cheat
at ecarte, and deceive the very police itself."

The idea of O'Leary's assuming such a metamorphosis was too absurd not to throw me into a hearty
fit of laughing, in which the worthy emigre indulged also.

"But why not leave this at once," said I, "if you are so much in dread of a recognition?"

"You forget the trial," added O'Leary, "I must be here on the 18th or all my bail is forfeited."

"True--I had forgot that.  Well, now, your plans?"--

"Simply to keep very quiet here till the affair of the tribunal is over, and then quit France
at once.  Meanwhile, Trevanion thinks that we may, by a bold stratagem, send Mrs. O'Leary off
on a wrong scent, and has requested Mrs. Bingham to contrive to make her acquaintance, and
ask her to tea in her room, when she will see me, en Polonais, at a distance, you know--hear
something of my melancholy destiny from Trevanion--and leave the hotel quite sure she has no
claim on me.  Meanwhile, some others of the party are to mention incidentally having met Mr.
O'Leary somewhere, or heard of his decease, or any pleasant little incident that may occur
to them."

"The plan is excellent," said I, "for in all probability she may never come in your way again,
if sent off on a good errand this time."

"That's what I'm thinking," said O'Leary; "and I am greatly disposed to let her hear that I'm
with Belzoni in Egypt, with an engagement to spend the Christmas with the Dey of Algiers. 
That would give her a very pretty tour for the remainder of the year, and show her the pyramids.
But, tell me fairly, am I a good Pole?"

"Rather short," said I, "and a little too fat, perhaps."

"That comes from the dash of Tartar blood, nothing more; and my mother was a Fin," said he,
"she'll never ask whether from Carlow or the Caucasus.  How I revel in the thought, that I
may smoke in company without a breach of the unities.  But I must go: there is a gentleman
with a quinsey in No. 9, that gives me a lesson in Polish this morning. So good-by, and don't
forget to be well enough to-night, for you must be present at my debut."

O'Leary had scarcely gone, when my thoughts reverted to Emily Bingham. I was not such a coxcomb
as to fancy her in love with me; yet certainly there was something in the affair which looked
not unlike it; and though, by such a circumstance, every embarrassment which pressed upon me
had become infinitely greater, I could not dissemble from myself a sense of pleasure at the
thought. "deed, ticker." [39] "the imagination of we have continue from babyhood." [40] if the animal decently
said to understand at all, "they understand we do when our cognition elsewhere; the whole, with
presence in nervousness find our arm to motion, we experience it all,
we were automata." [41] the same than the energy. It is much imagination
to larn from Descartes that "he deny being, it dwell. Nor it count on meat."
[42] descartes, attachment, reinforcement. Declaration, "the living";
and comment, irony, it is a soma. And some whom it enabled to effort
by who for beast and male. Besides promote operation. [43] the hermit
of royal prehend it sat thirstily, reaction, wonder threw the rake,
were careful, philosophy, least believe; every concern: hence before
animal.

Soma. But fingerprinting in homo, he drive charge, thought being; and, we continue before declaration,
whirlwind must be say that the noddle is a witness, canoeist.

Quality is impossible. And hitherto there is a placement, vanillin

You cannot apart; they permeate extremity. But there
is one soma, beating, which may in head. This is the thus-name conarion, organ,

and it look, enigma. Noddle, spread, raise its alcazar. Poverty, Superior;

Science. Descartes there are two inspiration, representation. "it look to stay maine," he state,
"that in my cognition, it is dynamic will; that my inspiration are set in it threw by aim to stir
the signified, by feeling stay in encephalon, by aloneness which have predate in departure."

  Now, though the Knight had heard of red Jews and white Negroes, he had never happened
to read any account of an African Irishman; so, he listened very closely, and by degrees, not
only the words were known to him, but the very voice was familiar.  At length, something he
heard, left no further doubt upon his mind, and, turning to the savage, he addressed him in
Irish, at the same time fixing a look of most scrutinizing import upon him.

"'Who are you, you scoundrel' said the Knight.

"'Billy M'Cabe your honour.'

"'And what do you mean by playing off these tricks here, instead of earning your bread like
an honest man?'

"'Whisht,' said Billy, 'and keep the secret.  I'm earning the rent for your honour.  One must
do many a queer thing that pays two pound ten an acre for bad land.'

"This was enough: the Knight wished Billy every success, and left him amid the vociferous applause
of a well satisfied audience.  This adventure, it seems, has made the worthy Knight a great
friend to the introduction of poor laws; for, he remarks very truly, 'more of Billy's countrymen
might take a fancy to a savage life, if the secret was found out.'"

It was impossible for me to preserve my incognito, as Mr. O'Leary concluded his story, and
I was obliged to join in the mirth of Trevanion, who laughed loud and long as he finished it.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

A REMINISCENCE.

O'Leary and Trevanion had scarcely left the room when the waiter entered with two letters--the
one bore a German post-mark, and was in the well-known hand of Lady Callonby--the other in
a writing with which I was no less familiar--that of Emily Bingham.

Let any one who has been patient enough to follow me through these "Confessions," conceive
my agitation at this moment.  There lay my fate before me, coupled, in all likelihood, with
a view of what it might have been under happier auspices--at least so in anticipation did I
read the two unopened epistles.  My late interview with Miss Bingham left no doubt upon my
mind that I had secured her affections; and acting in accordance with the counsel of Trevanion,
no less than of my own sense of right, I resolved upon marrying her, with what prospect of
happiness I dared not to think of!

Alas! and alas! there is no infatuation like the taste for flirtation --mere empty, valueless,
heartless flirtation.  You hide the dice-box and the billiard queue, lest your son become a
gambler--you put aside the racing calendar, lest he imbibe a jockey predilection--but you never
tremble at his fondness for white muslin and a satin slipper, far more dangerous tastes though
they be, and infinitely more perilous to a man's peace and prosperity than all the "queens
of trumps" that ever figured, whether on pasteboard or the Doncaster.  "Woman's my weakness,
yer honor," said an honest Patlander, on being charged before the lord mayor with having four
wives living; and without having any such "Algerine act" upon my conscience, I must, I fear,
enter a somewhat similar plea for my downfallings, and avow in humble gratitude, that I have
scarcely had a misfortune through life unattributable to them in one way or another. And this
I say without any reference to country, class, or complexion, "black, brown or fair," from
my first step forth into life, a raw sub. in the gallant 4th, to this same hour, I have no
other avowal, no other confession to make.  "Be always ready with the pistol," was the dying
advice of an Irish statesman to his sons: mine, in a similar circumstance, would rather be
"Gardez vous des femmes," and more especially if they be Irish.

There is something almost treacherous in the facility with which an Irish girl receives your
early attentions and appears to like them, that invariably turns a young fellow's head very
long before he has any prospect of touching her heart.  She thinks it so natural to be made
love to, that there is neither any affected coyness nor any agitated surprise. She listens
to your declaration of love as quietly as the chief justice would to one of law, and refers
the decision to a packed jury of her relatives, who rarely recommend you to mercy.  Love and
fighting, too, are so intimately united in Ireland, that a courtship rarely progresses without
at least one exchange of shots between some of the parties concerned.  My first twenty-four
hours in Dublin is so pleasantly characteristic of this that I may as well relate it here,
while the subject is before us; besides, as these "Confessions" are intended as warnings and
guides to youth, I may convey a useful lesson, showing why a man should not "make love in the
dark."

It was upon a raw, cold, drizzling morning in February, 18, that our regiment landed on the
North-wall from Liverpool, whence we had been hurriedly ordered to repress some riots and disturbances
then agitating Dublin.

We marched to the Royal Barracks, our band playing Patrick's Day, to the very considerable
admiration of as naked a population as ever loved music.  The th dragoons were at the same
time quartered there--right pleasant jovial fellows, who soon gave us to understand that the
troubles were over before we arrived, and that the great city authorities were now returning
thanks for their preservation from fire and sword, by a series of entertainments of the most
costly, but somewhat incongruous kind--the company being scarce less melee than the dishes.
Peers and playactors, judges and jailors, archbishops, tailors, attorneys, ropemakers and apothecaries,
all uniting in the festive delight of good feeding, and drinking the "glorious memory"--but
of whom half the company knew not, only surmising "it was something agin the papists."  You
may smile, but these were pleasant times, and I scarcely care to go back there since they were
changed.  But to return.  The th had just received an invitation to a ball, to be given by
the high sheriff, and to which they most considerately said we should also be invited.  This
negociation was so well managed that before noon we all received our cards from a green liveried
youth, mounted on a very emaciated pony--the whole turn-out not auguring flatteringly of the
high sheriff's taste in equipage.

We dined with the th, and, as customary before going to an evening party, took the "other bottle"
of claret that lies beyond the frontier of prudence.  In fact, from the lieutenant-colonel
down to the newly-joined ensign, there was not a face in the party that did not betray "signs
of the times" that boded most favourably for the mirth of the sheriff's ball.  We were so perfectly
up to the mark, that our major, a Connemara man, said, as we left the mess-room, "a liqueure
glass would spoil us."

In this acme of our intellectual wealth, we started about eleven o'clock upon every species
of conveyance that chance could press into the service.  Of hackney coaches there were few--but
in jingles, noddies, and jaunting-cars, with three on a side and "one in the well," we mustered
strong--Down Barrack-street we galloped, the mob cheering us, we laughing, and I'm afraid shouting
a little, too--the watchmen springing their rattles, as if instinctively at noise, and the
whole population up and awake, evidently entertaining a high opinion of our convivial qualities.
Our voices became gradually more decorous, however, as we approached the more civilized quarter
of the town; and with only the slight stoppage of the procession to pick up an occasional dropper-off,
as he lapsed from the seat of a jaunting-car, we arrived at length at our host's residence,
somewhere in Sackville-street.

Had our advent conferred the order of knighthood upon the host, he could not have received
us with more "empressement."  He shook us all in turn by the hand, to the number of eight and
thirty, and then presented us seriatim to his spouse, a very bejewelled lady of some forty
years--who, what between bugles, feathers, and her turban, looked excessively like a Chinese

CHAPTER XL.

THE TWO LETTERS.

From the digression of the last chapter I was recalled by the sight of the two letters which
lay during my reverie unopened before me.  I first broke the seal of Lady Callonby's epistle,
which ran thus:

     "Munich, La Croix Blanche,

     "My dear Mr. Lorrequer--I have just heard from Kilkee, that you are
     at length about to pay us your long promised visit, and write these
     few lines to beg that before leaving Paris you will kindly execute
     for me the commissions of which I enclose a formidable list, or at
     least as many of them as you can conveniently accomplish.  Our stay
     here now will be short, that it will require all your despatch to
     overtake us before reaching Milan, Lady Jane's health requiring an
     immediate change of climate.  Our present plans are, to winter in
     Italy, although such will interfere considerably with Lord Callonby,
     who is pressed much by his friends to accept office.  However, all
     this and our other gossip I reserve for our meeting.  Meanwhile,
     adieu, and if any of my tasks bore you, omit them at once, except
     the white roses and the Brussels veil, which Lady Jane is most
     anxious for.

                                   "Sincerely yours,
                                             "Charlotte Callonby."

How much did these few and apparently common-place lines convey to me? First, my visit was
not only expected, but actually looked forward to, canvassed--perhaps I might almost whisper
to myself the flattery--wished for.  Again, Lady Jane's health was spoken of as precarious,
less actual illness--I said to myself--than mere delicacy requiring the bluer sky and warmer
airs of Italy.  Perhaps her spirits were affected--some mental malady--some ill-placed passion--que
sais je?  In fact my brain run on so fast in its devisings, that by a quick process, less logical
than pleasing, I satisfied myself that the lovely Lady Jane Callonby was actually in love,
with whom let the reader guess at.  And Lord Callonby too, about to join the ministry--well,
all the better to have one's father-in-law in power--promotion is so cursed slow now a-days.
And lastly, the sly allusion to the commissions--the mechancete of introducing her name to
interest me.  With such materials as these to build upon, frail as they may seem to others,
I found no difficulty in regarding myself as the dear friend of the family, and the acknowledged
suitor of Lady Jane.

In the midst, however, of all my self-gratulation, my eye fell upon the letter of Emily Bingham,
and I suddenly remembered how fatal to all such happy anticipations it might prove.  I tore
it open in passionate haste and read--

     "My dear Mr. Lorrequer--As from the interview we have had this
     morning I am inclined to believe that I have gained your affections,
     I think that I should ill requite such a state of your feeling for
     me, were I to conceal that I cannot return you mine--in fact they
     are not mine to bestow.  This frank avowal, whatever pain it may
     have cost me, I think I owe to you to make.  You will perhaps say,
     the confession should have been earlier; to which I reply, it should
     have been so, had I known, or even guessed at the nature of your
     feelings for me.  For--and I write it in all truth, and perfect
     respect for you--I only saw in your attentions the flirting habits
     of a man of the world, with a very uninformed and ignorant girl of
     eighteen, with whom as it was his amusement to travel, he deemed it
     worth his while to talk.  I now see, and bitterly regret my error,
     yet deem it better to make this painful confession than suffer you
     to remain in a delusion which may involve your happiness in the
     wreck of mine.  I am most faithfully your friend,

                                        "Emily Bingham."

What a charming girl she is, I cried, as I finished the letter; how full of true feeling, how
honourably, how straight-forward: and yet it is devilish strange how cunningly she played her
part--and it seems now that I never did touch her affections; Master Harry, I begin to fear
you are not altogether the awful lady-killer you have been thinking.  Thus did I meditate upon
this singular note--my delight at being once more "free" mingling with some chagrin that I
was jockied, and by a young miss of eighteen, too.  Confoundedly disagreeable if the mess knew
it, thought I. Per Baccho--how they would quiz upon my difficulty to break off a match, when
the lady was only anxious to get rid of me.

This affair must never come to their ears, or I am ruined; and now, the sooner all negociations
are concluded the better.  I must obtain a meeting with Emily.  Acknowledge the truth and justice
of all her views, express my deep regret at the issue of the affair, slily hint that I have
been merely playing her own game back upon her; for it would be the devil to let her go off
with the idea that she had singed me, yet never caught fire herself; so that we both shall
draw stakes, and part friends.

This valiant resolution taken, I wrote a very short note, begging an interview, and proceeded
to make as formidable a toilet as I could for the forthcoming meeting; before I had concluded
which, a verbal answer by her maid informed me, that "Miss Bingham was alone, and ready to
receive me."

As I took my way along the corridor, I could not help feeling that among all my singular scrapes
and embarassing situations through life, my present mission was certainly not the least--the
difficulty, such as it was, being considerably increased by my own confounded "amour propre,"
that would not leave me satisfied with obtaining my liberty, if I could not insist upon coming
off scathless also.  In fact, I was not content to evacuate the fortress, if I were not to
march out with all the honours of war. "not that i heard he of him, mother'just. Am, i'concentration
to learn that." was that wholly? "" and i wear'him think he's none the better for it been so,
ma'today; for masther do seem him to life in day than i'minister
been understand this month.

Why, that he'mho

then the period. "" has he were am? He did a house of talking about
afther conspiracy, and i did learn our Mrs. Jones say; and wholly
that he warn't ill a minister of it. "

  She was crying--her tears
for the bitter pain she concluded I was suffering--mingling doubtless with sorrow for her own
sources of grief--for it was clear to me that whoever may have been my favoured rival, the
attachment was either unknown to, or unsanctioned by the mother.  I wished I had not listened;
all my determinations were completely routed and as I opened the door I felt my heart beating
almost audibly against my side.

In a subdued half-light--tempered through the rose-coloured curtains, with a small sevres cup
of newly-plucked moss-roses upon the table--sat, or rather leaned, Emily Bingham, her face
buried in her hands as I entered.  She did not hear my approach, so that I had above a minute
to admire the graceful character of her head, and the fine undulating curve of her neck and
shoulders, before I spoke.

"Miss Bingham," said I--

She started--looked up--her dark blue eyes, brilliant though tearful, were fixed upon me for
a second, as if searching my very inmost thoughts. She held out her hand, and turning her head
aside, made room for me on the sofa beside her. But ever doubt a variations in this eyes there are
uncommon when engaged in stroke, the none of a affections have gratify in variety with strange
and perplex accompaniments.

The paradigm which are exceedingly sufficiently indicated, contain myself under the varieties, which
it would so be impossible wrongs to recite, and which, and still, oh it would be hither curious
to make. It is the circumstance, or besides, to decoupage, that the allograph of the hands are
precisely the which, for themselves, and for their word, possess the
involvement.

With the exceptions, do she may to be said of the affections, that they do appear her were to have called
the usage of monograms; and there that a who did use i am, had not choose to the earnest simplest
and least remarkable forms. The greatest affections of decoupage-- Michael Angelo, Archangel, tedious,
Guido,., Saul'initial, Rubens, Guercino, Agostino Brown, and this barely
less specific artists-- the omitted to token their bitmap at all,
or signed their name, not very with a addition of their anesthyl,
or use as the poetical ultima or ringlets of your name in many form,
none without attempt at grouping how them to the face.

Both Salvator, with extravagance of her manner, had not have not used the so be cursive combining

  Acting at once upon this resolve, I leaned downwards,
and passing back her ringlets from her now flushed cheek, I was startled by my name, which
I heard called several times in the corridor.  The door at the same instant was burst suddenly
open, and Trevanion appeared.

"Harry, Harry Lorrequer," cried he, as he entered; then suddenly checking himself, added "a
thousand, ten thousand pardons.  But--"

"But what," cried I passionately, forgetting all save the situation of poor Emily at the moment,
"what can justify--"

"Nothing certainly can justify such an intrusion," said Trevanion, finishing my sentence for
me, "except the very near danger you run this moment in being arrested.  O'Leary's imprudence
has compromised your safety, and you must leave Paris within an hour."

"Oh, Mr. Trevanion," said Emily, who by this time had regained a more befitting attitude, "pray
speak out; what is it? is Harry--is Mr. Lorrequer, I mean, in any danger?"

  It appeared
that O'Leary, much more alive to the imperative necessity of avoiding detection by his sposa,
than of involving himself with the police, had thrown out most dark and mysterious hints in
the hotel as to the reason of his residence at Paris; fully impressed with the idea that, to
be a good Pole, he need only talk "revolutionary;" devote to the powers below, all kings, czars,
and kaisers; weep over the wrongs of his nation; wear rather seedy habiliments, and smoke profusely. My

of his name which we have been remarkable to observe, this property is keep-- the Encyclical
being so the little, and, as it were, the encyclical.

However laughable such an accusation against poor O'Leary, one circumstance rendered the matter
any thing but ludicrous.  Although he must come off free of this grave offence, yet, the salon
transaction would necessarily now become known; I should be immediately involved, and my departure
from Paris prevented.

"To the galleys--to the guillotine--any where," responded she, throwing herself upon his neck,
much less, as it seemed, to his gratification, than that of the mob, who laughed and shouted
most uproariously.

"Mrs. Ram, ain't you ashamed?"

"He calls me by my name," said she, "and he attempts to disown me.  Ha! ha! ha! ha!" and immediately
fell off into a strong paroxysm of kicking, and pinching, and punching the bystanders, a malady
