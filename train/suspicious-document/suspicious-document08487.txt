INTRODUCTION

THE CATHOLIC CONSCIENCE OF HISTORY

I say the Catholic "conscience" of history--I say "conscience"--that is, an intimate knowledge
through identity: the intuition of a thing which is one with the knower--I do not say "The
Catholic Aspect of History." This talk of "aspects" is modern and therefore part of a decline:
it is false, and therefore ephemeral: I will not stoop to it. I will rather do homage to truth
and say that there is no such thing as a Catholic "aspect" of European history. There is a
Protestant aspect, a Jewish aspect, a Mohammedan aspect, a Japanese aspect, and so forth. For
all of these look on Europe from without. The Catholic sees Europe from within. There is no
more a Catholic "aspect" of European history than there is a man's "aspect" of himself.

Sophistry does indeed pretend that there is even a man's "aspect" of himself. In nothing does
false philosophy prove itself more false. For a man's way of perceiving himself (when he does
so honestly and after a cleansing examination of his mind) is in line with his Creator's, and
therefore with reality: he sees from within.

Let me pursue this metaphor. Man has in him conscience, which is the voice of God. Not only
does he know by this that the outer world is real, but also that his own personality is real.

When a man, although flattered by the voice of another, yet says within himself, "I am a mean
fellow," he has hold of reality. When a man, though maligned of the world, says to himself
of himself, "My purpose was just," he has hold of reality. He knows himself, for he is himself.
A man does not know an infinite amount about himself. But the finite amount he does know is
all in the map; it is all part of what is really there. What he does not know about himself
would, did he know it, fit in with what he does know about himself. There are indeed "aspects"
of a man for all others except these two, himself and God Who made him. These two, when they
regard him, see him as he is; all other minds have their several views of him; and these indeed
are "aspects," each of which is false, while all differ. But a man's view of himself is not
an "aspect:" it is a comprehension.

Now then, so it is with us who are of the Faith and the great story of Europe. A Catholic as
he reads that story does not grope at it from without, he understands it from within. He cannot
understand it altogether because he is a finite being; but he is also that which he has to
understand. The Faith is Europe and Europe is the Faith.

The Catholic brings to history (when I say "history" in these pages I mean the history of Christendom)
self-knowledge. As a man in the confessional accuses himself of what he knows to be true and
what other people cannot judge, so a Catholic, talking of the united European civilization,
when he blames it, blames it for motives and for acts which are his own. He himself could have
done those things in person. He is not relatively right in his blame, he is absolutely right.
As a man can testify to his own motive so can the Catholic testify to unjust, irrelevant, or
ignorant conceptions of the European story; for he knows why and how it proceeded. Others,
not Catholic, look upon the story of Europe externally as strangers. They have to deal with
something which presents itself to them partially and disconnectedly, by its phenomena alone:
he sees it all from its centre in its essence, and together.

I say again, renewing the terms, The Church is Europe: and Europe is The Church.

The Catholic conscience of history is not a conscience which begins with the development of
the Church in the basin of the Mediterranean. It goes back much further than that. The Catholic
understands the soil in which that plant of the Faith arose. In a way that no other man can,
he understands the Roman military effort; why that effort clashed with the gross Asiatic and
merchant empire of Carthage; what we derived from the light of Athens; what food we found in
the Irish and the British, the Gallic tribes, their dim but awful memories of immortality;
what cousinship we claim with the ritual of false but profound religions, and even how ancient
Israel (the little violent people, before they got poisoned, while they were yet National in
the mountains of Judea) was, in the old dispensation at least, central and (as we Catholics
say) sacred: devoted to a peculiar mission.

For the Catholic the whole perspective falls into its proper order. The picture is normal.
Nothing is distorted to him. The procession of our great story is easy, natural, and full.
It is also final.

But the modern Catholic, especially if he is confined to the use of the English tongue, suffers
from a deplorable (and it is to be hoped), a passing accident. No modern book in the English
tongue gives him a conspectus of the past; he is compelled to study violently hostile authorities,
North German (or English copying North German), whose knowledge is never that of the true and
balanced European.

He comes perpetually across phrases which he sees at once to be absurd, either in their limitations
or in the contradictions they connote. But unless he has the leisure for an extended study,
he cannot put his finger upon the precise mark of the absurdity. In the books he reads--if
they are in the English language at least--he finds things lacking which his instinct for Europe
tells him should be there; but he cannot supply their place because the man who wrote those
books was himself ignorant of such things, or rather could not conceive them.

I will take two examples to show what I mean. The one is the present battlefield of Europe:
a large affair not yet cleared, concerning all nations and concerning them apparently upon
matters quite indifferent to the Faith. It is a thing which any stranger might analyze (one
would think) and which yet no historian explains.

The second I deliberately choose as an example particular and narrow: an especially doctrinal
story. I mean the story of St. Thomas of Canterbury, of which the modern historian makes nothing
but an incomprehensible contradiction; but which is to a Catholic a sharp revelation of the
half-way house between the Empire and modern nationalities.

As to the first of these two examples: Here is at last the Great War in Europe: clearly an
issue--things come to a head. How came it? Why these two camps? What was this curious grouping
of the West holding out in desperate Alliance against the hordes that Prussia drove to a victory
apparently inevitable after the breakdown of the Orthodox Russian shell? Where lay the roots
of so singular a contempt for our old order, chivalry and morals, as Berlin then displayed?
Who shall explain the position of the Papacy, the question of Ireland, the aloofness of old Spain?

It is all a welter if we try to order it by modern, external--especially by any materialist
or even skeptical--analysis. It was not climate against climate--that facile materialist contrast
of "environment," which is the crudest and stupidest explanation of human affairs. It was not
race--if indeed any races can still be distinguished in European blood save broad and confused
appearances, such as Easterner and Westerner, short and tall, dark and fair. It was not--as
another foolish academic theory (popular some years ago) would pretend--an economic affair.
There was here no revolt of rich against poor, no pressure of undeveloped barbarians against
developed lands, no plan of exploitation, nor of men organized, attempting to seize the soil
of less fruitful owners.

How came these two opponents into being, the potential antagonism of which was so strong that
millions willingly suffered their utmost for the sake of a decision?

That man who would explain the tremendous judgment on the superficial test of religious differences
among modern "sects" must be bewildered indeed! I have seen the attempt made in more than one
journal and book, enemy and Allied. The results are lamentable!

Prussia indeed, the protagonist, was atheist. But her subject provinces supported her exultantly,
Catholic Cologne and the Rhine and tamely Catholic Bavaria. Her main support--without which
she could not have challenged Europe--was that very power whose sole reason for being was Catholicism:
the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine which, from Vienna, controlled and consolidated the Catholic
against the Orthodox Slav: the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine was the champion of Catholic organization
in Eastern Europe.

The Catholic Irish largely stood apart.

Spain, not devout at all, but hating things not Catholic because those things are foreign,
was more than apart. Britain had long forgotten the unity of Europe. France, a protagonist,
was notoriously divided within herself over the religious principle of that unity. No modern
religious analysis such as men draw up who think of religion as Opinion will make anything
of all this. Then why was there a fight? People who talk of "Democracy" as the issue of the
Great War may be neglected: Democracy--one noble, ideal, but rare and perilous, form of human
government--was not at stake. No historian can talk thus. The essentially aristocratic policy
of England now turned to a plutocracy, the despotism of Russia and Prussia, the immense complex
of all other great modern states gives such nonsense the lie.

People who talk of "A struggle for supremacy between the two Teutonic champions Germany and
England" are less respectable still. England is not Teutonic, and was not protagonist. The
English Cabinet decided by but the smallest possible majority (a majority of one) to enter
the war. The Prussian Government never dreamt it would have to meet England at all. There is
no question of so single an issue. The world was at war. Why? No man is an historian who cannot
answer from the past. All who can answer from the past, and are historians, see that it is
the historical depth of the European faith, not its present surface, which explains all.

The struggle was against Prussia.

Why did Prussia arise? Because the imperfect Byzantine evangelization of the Eastern Slavonic
Plains just failed to meet, there in Prussia, the western flood of living tradition welling
up from Rome. Prussia was an hiatus. In that small neglected area neither half cultivated from
the Byzantine East nor fully from the Roman West rose a strong garden of weeds. And weeds sow
themselves. Prussia, that is, this patch of weeds, could not extend until the West weakened
through schism. It had to wait till the battle of the Reformation died down. But it waited.
And at last, when there was opportunity, it grew prodigiously. The weed patch over-ran first
Poland and the Germanies, then half Europe. When it challenged all civilization at last it
was master of a hundred and fifty million souls.

What are the tests of this war? In their vastly different fashions they are Poland and Ireland--the
extreme islands of tenacious tradition: the conservators of the Past through a national passion
for the Faith.

The Great War was a clash between an uneasy New Thing which desired to live its own distorted
life anew and separate from Europe, and the old Christian rock. This New Thing is, in its morals,
in the morals spread upon it by Prussia, the effect of that great storm wherein three hundred
years ago Europe made shipwreck and was split into two. This war was the largest, yet no more
than the recurrent, example of that unceasing wrestle: the outer, the unstable, the untraditional--which
is barbarism--pressing blindly upon the inner, the traditional, the strong--which is Ourselves:
which is Christendom: which is Europe.

Small wonder that the Cabinet at Westminster hesitated!

We used to say during the war that if Prussia conquered civilization failed, but that if the
Allies conquered civilization was reestablished--What did we mean? We meant, not that the New
Barbarians could not handle a machine: They can. But we meant that they had learnt all from
us. We meant that they cannot continue of themselves; and that we can. We meant that they have
no roots.

When we say that Vienna was the tool of Berlin, that Madrid should be ashamed, what do we mean?
It has no meaning save that civilization is one and we its family: That which challenged us,
though it controlled so much which should have aided us and was really our own, was external
to civilization and did not lose that character by the momentary use of civilized Allies.

When we said that "the Slav" failed us, what did we mean? It was not a statement of race. Poland
is Slav, so is Serbia: they were two vastly differing states and yet both with us. It meant
that the Byzantine influence was never sufficient to inform a true European state or to teach
Russia a national discipline; because the Byzantine Empire, the tutor of Russia, was cut off
from us, the Europeans, the Catholics, the heirs, who are the conservators of the world.

The Catholic Conscience of Europe grasped this war--with apologies where it was in the train
of Prussia, with affirmation where it was free. It saw what was toward. It weighed, judged,
decided upon the future--the two alternative futures which lie before the world.

All other judgments of the war made nonsense: You had, on the Allied side, the most vulgar
professional politicians and their rich paymasters shouting for "Democracy;" pedants mumbling
about "Race." On the side of Prussia (the negation of nationality) you have the use of some
vague national mission of conquest divinely given to the very various Germans and the least
competent to govern. You would come at last (if you listened to such varied cries) to see the
Great War as a mere folly, a thing without motive, such as the emptiest internationals conceive
the thing to have been.

So much for the example of the war. It is explicable as a challenge to the tradition of Europe.
It is inexplicable on any other ground. The Catholic alone is in possession of the tradition
of Europe: he alone can see and judge in this matter.

From so recent and universal an example I turn to one local, distant, precise, in which this
same Catholic Conscience of European history may be tested.

of Canterbury. [022] a is here into death was blurred to Europe, we are of Europe, who is not

These men are numerous, they have formed, in the Protestant and other anti-Catholic universities,
a whole school of hypothetical and unreal history in which, though the original workers are
few, their copyists are innumerable: and that school of unreal history is still dogmatically
taught in the anti-Catholic centres of Europe and of the world.

Now our quarrel with this school should be, not that it is anti-Catholic--that concerns another
sphere of thought--but that it is unhistorical.

To neglect the truth that the Roman Empire with its institutions and its spirit was the sole
origin of European civilization; to forget or to diminish the truth that the Empire accepted
in its maturity a certain religion; to conceal the fact that this religion was not a vague
mood, but a determinate and highly organized corporation; to present in the first centuries
some non-existant "Christianity" in place of the existant Church; to suggest that the Faith
was a vague agreement among individual holders of opinions instead of what it historically
was, the doctrine of a fixed authoritative institution; to fail to identify that institution
with the institution still here today and still called the Catholic Church; to exaggerate the
insignificant barbaric influences which came from outside the Empire and did nothing to modify
its spirit; to pretend that the Empire or its religion have at any time ceased to be--that
is, to pretend that there has ever been a solution of continuity between the past and the present
of Europe--all these pretensions are parts of one historical falsehood.

In all by which we Europeans differ from the rest of mankind there is nothing which was not
originally peculiar to the Roman Empire, or is not demonstrably derived from something peculiar
to it.

In material objects the whole of our wheeled traffic, our building materials, brick, glass,
mortar, cut-stone, our cooking, our staple food and drink; in forms, the arch, the column,
the bridge, the tower, the well, the road, the canal; in expression, the alphabet, the very
words of most of our numerous dialects and polite languages, the order of still more, the logical
sequence of our thought--all spring from that one source. So with implements: the saw, the
hammer, the plane, the chisel, the file, the spade, the plough, the rake, the sickle, the ladder;
all these we have from that same origin. Of our institutions it is the same story. The divisions
and the sub-divisions of Europe, the parish, the county, the province, the fixed national traditions
with their boundaries, the emplacement of the great European cities, the routes of communication
between them, the universities, the Parliaments, the Courts of Law, and their jurisprudence,
all these derive entirely from the old Roman Empire, our well-spring.

It may here be objected that to connect so closely the worldly foundations of our civilization
with the Catholic or universal religion of it, is to limit the latter and to make of it a merely
human thing.

The accusation would be historically valueless in any case, for in history we are not concerned
with the claims of the supernatural, but with a sequence of proved events in the natural order.
But if we leave the province of history and consider that of theology, the argument is equally
baseless. Every manifestation of divine influence among men must have its human circumstance
of place and time. The Church might have risen under Divine Providence in any spot: it did,
as a fact, spring up in the high Greek tide of the Levant and carries to this day the noble
Hellenic garb. It might have risen at any time: it did, as a fact, rise just at the inception
of that united Imperial Roman system which we are about to examine. It might have carried for
its ornaments and have had for its sacred language the accoutrements and the speech of any
one of the other great civilizations, living or dead: of Assyria, of Egypt, of Persia, of China,
of the Indies. As a matter of historical fact, the Church was so circumstanced in its origin
and development that its external accoutrement and its language were those of the Mediterranean,
that is, of Greece and Rome: of the Empire.

Now those who would falsify history from a conscious or unconscious bias against the Catholic
Church, will do so in many ways, some of which will always prove contradictory of some others.
For truth is one, error disparate and many.

The attack upon the Catholic Church may be compared to the violent, continual, but inchoate
attack of barbarians upon some civilized fortress; such an attack will proceed now from this
direction, now from that, along any one of the infinite number of directions from which a single
point may be approached. Today there is attack from the North, tomorrow an attack from the
South. Their directions are flatly contradictory, but the contradiction is explained by the
fact that each is directed against a central and fixed opponent.

Thus, some will exaggerate the power of the Roman Empire as a pagan institution; they will
pretend that the Catholic Church was something alien to that pagan thing; that the Empire was
great and admirable before Catholicism came, weak and despicable upon its acceptation of the
Creed. They will represent the Faith as creeping like an Oriental disease into the body of
a firm Western society which it did not so much transform as liquefy and dissolve.

Others will take the clean contrary line and make out a despicable Roman Empire to have fallen
before the advent of numerous and vigorous barbarians (Germans, of course) possessing all manner
of splendid pagan qualities--which usually turn out to be nineteenth century Protestant qualities.
These are contrasted against the diseased Catholic body of the Roman Empire which they are
pictured as attacking.

Others adopt a simpler manner. They treat the Empire and its institutions as dead after a certain
date, and discuss the rise of a new society without considering its Catholic and Imperial origins.
Nothing is commoner, for instance (in English schools), than for boys to be taught that the
pirate raids and settlements of the fifth century in this Island were the "coming of the English,"
and the complicated history of Britain is simplified for them into a story of how certain bold
seafaring pagans (full of all the virtues we ascribe to ourselves today) first devastated,
then occupied, and at last, of their sole genius, developed a land which Roman civilization
had proved inadequate to hold.

There is, again, a conscious or unconscious error (conscious or unconscious, pedantic or ignorant,
according to the degree of learning in him who propagates it) which treats of the religious
life of Europe as though it were something quite apart from the general development of our
civilization.

There are innumerable text-books in which a man may read the whole history of his own, a European,
country, from, say, the fifth to the sixteenth century, and never hear of the Blessed Sacrament:
which is as though a man were to write of England in the nineteenth century without daring
to speak of newspapers and limited companies. Warped by such historical enormities, the reader
is at a loss to understand the ordinary motives of his ancestors. Not only do the great crises
in the history of the Church obviously escape him, but much more do the great crises in civil
history escape him.

To set right, then, our general view of history it is necessary to be ready with a sound answer
to the prime question of all, which is this: "What was the Roman Empire?"

If you took an immigrant coming fresh into the United States today and let him have a full
knowledge of all that had happened since the Civil War: if you gave him of the Civil War itself
a partial, confused and very summary account: if of all that went before it, right away back
to the first colonists, you were to leave him either wholly ignorant or ludicrously misinformed
(and slightly informed at that), what then could he make of the problems in American Society,
or how would he be equipped to understand the nation of which he was to be a citizen? To give
such a man the elements of civic training you must let him know what the Colonies were, what
the War of Independence, and what the main institutions preceding that event and created by
it. He would have further to know soundly the struggle between North and South, and the principles
underlying that struggle. Lastly, and most important of all, he would have to see all this
in a correct perspective.

So it is with us in the larger question of that general civilization which is common to both
Americans and Europeans, and which in its vigor has extended garrisons, as it were, into Asia
and Africa. We cannot understand it today unless we understand what it developed from. What
was the origin from which we sprang? What was the Roman Empire?

The Roman Empire was a united civilization, the prime characteristic of which was the acceptation,
absolute and unconditional, of one common mode of life by all those who dwelt within its boundaries.
It is an idea very difficult for the modern man to seize, accustomed as he is to a number of
sovereign countries more or less sharply differentiated, and each separately colored, as it
were, by different customs, a different language, and often a different religion. Thus the
modern man sees France, French speaking, with an architecture, manners, laws of its own, etc.;
he saw (till yesterday) North Germany under the Prussian hegemony, German speaking, with yet
another set of institutions, and so forth. When he thinks, therefore, of any great conflict
of opinion, such as the discussion between aristocracy and democracy today, he thinks in terms
of different countries. Ireland, for instance, is Democratic, England is Aristocratic--and
so forth.

Again, the modern man thinks of a community, however united, as something bounded by, and in
contrast with, other communities. When he writes or thinks of France he does not think of France
only, but of the points in which France contrasts with England, North Germany, South Germany,
Italy, etc.

Now the men living in the Roman Empire regarded civic life in a totally different way. All
conceivable antagonisms (and they were violent) were antagonisms within one State. No differentiation
of State against State was conceivable or was attempted.

From the Euphrates to the Scottish Highlands, from the North Sea to the Sahara and the Middle
Nile, all was one State.

The world outside the Roman Empire was, in the eyes of the Imperial citizen, a sort of waste.
It was not thickly populated, it had no appreciable arts or sciences, it was barbaric. That
outside waste of sparse and very inferior tribes was something of a menace upon the frontiers,
or, to speak more accurately, something of an irritation. But that menace or irritation was
never conceived of as we conceive of the menace of a foreign power. It was merely the trouble
of preventing a fringe of imperfect, predatory, and small barbaric communities outside the
boundaries from doing harm to a vast, rich, thickly populated, and highly organized State within.

The members of these communities (principally the Dutch, Frisian, Rhenish and other Germanic
peoples, but also on the other frontiers, the nomads of the desert, and in the West, islanders
and mountaineers, Irish and Caledonian) were all tinged with the great Empire on which they
bordered. Its trade permeated them. We find its coins everywhere. Its names for most things
became part of their speech. They thought in terms of it. They had a sort of grievance when
they were not admitted to it. They perpetually begged for admittance.

They wanted to deal with the Empire, to enjoy its luxury, now and then to raid little portions
of its frontier wealth.

They never dreamt of "conquest." On the other hand the Roman administrator was concerned with
getting barbarians to settle in an orderly manner on the frontier fields, so that he could
exploit their labor, with coaxing them to serve as mercenaries in the Roman armies, or (when
there was any local conflict) with defeating them in local battles, taking them prisoners and
making them slaves.

I have said that the mere number of these exterior men (German, Caledonian, Irish, Slav, Moorish,
Arab, etc.) was small compared with the numbers of civilization, and, I repeat, in the eyes
of the citizens of the Empire, their lack of culture made them more insignificant still.

At only one place did the Roman Empire have a common frontier with another civilization, properly
so called. It was a very short frontier, not one-twentieth of the total boundaries of the Empire.
It was the Eastern or Persian frontier, guarded by spaces largely desert. And though a true
civilization lay beyond, that civilization was never of great extent nor really powerful. This
frontier was variously drawn at various times, but corresponded roughly to the Plains of Mesopotamia.
The Mediterranean peoples of the Levant, from Antioch to Judea, were always within that frontier.
They were Roman. The mountain peoples of Persia were always beyond it. Nowhere else was there
any real rivalry or contact with the foreigner, and even this rivalry and contact (though "The
Persian War" is the only serious foreign or equal war in the eyes of all the rulers from Julius
Cæsar to the sixth century) counted for little in the general life of Rome.

The point cannot be too much insisted upon, nor too often repeated, so strange is it to our
modern modes of thought, and so essentially characteristic of the first centuries of the Christian
era and the formative period during which Christian civilization took its shape. Men lived
as citizens of one State which they took for granted and which they even regarded as eternal.
There would be much grumbling against the taxes and here and there revolts against them, but
never a suggestion that the taxes should be levied by any other than imperial authority, or
imposed in any other than the imperial manner. There was plenty of conflict between armies
and individuals as to who should have the advantage of ruling, but never any doubt as to the
type of function which the "Emperor" filled, nor as to the type of universally despotic action
which he exercised. There were any number of little local liberties and customs which were
the pride of the separate places to which they attached, but there was no conception of such
local differences being antagonistic to the one life of the one State. That State was, for
the men of that time, the World.

The complete unity of this social system was the more striking from the fact that it underlay
not only such innumerable local customs and liberties, but an almost equal number of philosophic
opinions, of religious practices, and of dialects. There was not even one current official
language for the educated thought of the Empire: there were two, Greek and Latin. And in every
department of human life there co-existed this very large liberty of individual and local expression,
coupled with a complete, and, as it were, necessary unity, binding the whole vast body together.
Emperor might succeed Emperor, in a series of civil wars. Several Emperors might be reigning
together. The office of Emperor might even be officially and consciously held in commission
among four or more men. But the power of the Emperor was always one power, his office one office,
and the system of the Empire one system.

It is not the purpose of these few pages to attempt a full answer to the question of how such
a civic state of mind came to be, but the reader must have some sketch of its development if
he is to grasp its nature.

The old Mediterranean world out of which the Empire grew had consisted (before that Empire
was complete--say, from an unknown most distant past to 50 B.C.) in two types of society: there
stood in it as rare exceptions States, or nations in our modern sense, governed by a central
Government, which controlled a large area, and were peopled by the inhabitants of many towns
and villages. Of this sort was ancient Egypt. But there were also, surrounding that inland
sea, in such great numbers as to form the predominant type of society, a series of Cities,
some of them commercial ports, most of them controlling a small area from which they drew their
agricultural subsistence, but all of them remarkable for this, that their citizens drew their
civic life from, felt patriotism for, were the soldiers of, and paid their taxes to, not a
nation in our sense but a municipality.

These cities and the small surrounding territories which they controlled (which, I repeat,
were often no more than local agricultural areas necessary for the sustenance of the town)
were essentially the sovereign Powers of the time. Community of language, culture, and religion
might, indeed, bind them in associations more or less strict. One could talk of the Phoenician
cities, of the Greek cities, and so forth. But the individual City was always the unit. City
made war on City. The City decided its own customs, and was the nucleus of religion. The God
was the God of the city. A rim of such points encircled the eastern and central Mediterranean
wherever it was habitable by man. Even the little oasis of the Cyrenæan land with sand on every
side, but habitable, developed its city formations. Even on the western coasts of the inland
ocean, which received their culture by sea from the East, such City States, though more rare,
dotted the littoral of Algeria, Provence and Spain.

Three hundred years before Our Lord was born this moral equilibrium was disturbed by the huge
and successful adventure of the Macedonian Alexander.

The Greek City States had just been swept under the hegemony of Macedon, when, in the shape
of small but invincible armies, the common Greek culture under Alexander overwhelmed the East.
Egypt, the Levant littoral and much more, were turned into one Hellenized (that is, "Greecified")
civilization. The separate cities, of course, survived, and after Alexander's death unity of
control was lost in various and fluctuating dynasties derived from the arrangements and quarrels
of his generals. But the old moral equilibrium was gone and the conception of a general civilization
had appeared. Henceforward the Syrian, the Jew, the Egyptian saw with Greek eyes and the Greek
tongue was the medium of all the East for a thousand years. Hence are the very earliest names
of Christian things, Bishop, Church, Priest, Baptism, Christ, Greek names. Hence all our original
documents and prayers are Greek and shine with a Greek light: nor are any so essentially Greek
in idea as the four Catholic Gospels.

Meanwhile in Italy one city, by a series of accidents very difficult to follow (since we have
only later accounts--and they are drawn from the city's point of view only), became the chief
of the City States in the Peninsula. Some few it had conquered in war and had subjected to
taxation and to the acceptation of its own laws; many it protected by a sort of superior alliance;
with many more its position was ill defined and perhaps in origin had been a position of allied
equality. But at any rate, a little after the Alexandrian Hellenization of the East this city
had in a slower and less universal way begun to break down the moral equilibrium of the City
States in Italy, and had produced between the Apennines and the sea (and in some places beyond
the Apennines) a society in which the City State, though of coarse surviving, was no longer
isolated or sovereign, but formed part of a larger and already definite scheme. The city which
had arrived at such a position, and which was now the manifest capital of the Italian scheme,
was ROME.

Contemporary with the last successes of this development in Italy went a rival development
very different in its nature, but bound to come into conflict with the Roman because it also
was extending. This was the commercial development of Carthage. Carthage, a Phoenician, that
is, a Levantine and Semitic, colony, had its city life like all the rest. It had shown neither
the aptitude nor the desire that Rome had shown for conquest, for alliances, and in general
for a spread of its spirit and for the domination of its laws and modes of thought. The business
of Carthage was to enrich itself: not indirectly as do soldiers (who achieve riches as but
one consequence of the pursuit of arms), but directly, as do merchants, by using men indirectly,
by commerce, and by the exploitation of contracts.

The Carthaginian occupied mining centres in Spain, and harbors wherever he could find them,
especially in the Western Mediterranean. He employed mercenary troops. He made no attempt to
radiate outward slowly step by step, as does the military type, but true to the type of every
commercial empire, from his own time to our own, the Carthaginian built up a scattered hotchpotch
of dominion, bound together by what is today called the "Command of the Sea."

That command was long absolute and Carthaginian power depended on it wholly. But such a power
could not co-exist with the growing strength of martial Italy. Rome challenged Carthage; and
after a prodigious struggle, which lasted to within two hundred years of the birth of Our Lord,
ruined the Carthaginian power. Fifty years later the town itself was destroyed by the Romans,
and its territory turned into a Roman province. So perished for many hundred years the dangerous
illusion that the merchant can master the soldier. But never had that illusion seemed nearer
to the truth than at certain moments in the duel between Carthage and Rome.

The main consequence of this success was that, by the nature of the struggle, the Western Mediterranean,
with all its City States, with its half-civilized Iberian peoples, lying on the plateau of
Spain behind the cities of the littoral, the corresponding belt of Southern France, and the
cultivated land of Northern Africa, fell into the Roman system, and became, but in a more united
way, what Italy had already long before become. The Roman power, or, if the term be preferred,
the Roman confederation, with its ideas of law and government, was supreme in the Western Mediterranean
and was compelled by its geographical position to extend itself inland further and further
into Spain, and even (what was to be of prodigious consequence to the world) into GAUL.

But before speaking of the Roman incorporation of Gaul we must notice that in the hundred years
after the final fall of Carthage, the Eastern Mediterranean had also begun to come into line.
This Western power, the Roman, thus finally established, occupied Corinth in the same decade
as that which saw the final destruction of Carthage, and what had once been Greece became a
Roman province. All the Alexandrian or Grecian East--Syria, Egypt--followed. The Macedonian
power in its provinces came to depend upon the Roman system in a series of protectorates, annexations,
and occupations, which two generations or so before the foundation of the Catholic Church had
made Rome, though her system was not yet complete, the centre of the whole Mediterranean world.
The men whose sons lived to be contemporary with the Nativity saw that the unity of that world
was already achieved. The World was now one, and was built up of the islands, the peninsulas,
and the littoral of the Inland Sea.

So the Empire might have remained, and so one would think it naturally would have remained,
a Mediterranean thing, but for that capital experiment which has determined all future history--Julius
Cæsar's conquest of Gaul--Gaul, the mass of which lay North, Continental, exterior to the Mediterranean:
Gaul which linked up with the Atlantic and the North Sea: Gaul which lived by the tides: Gaul
which was to be the foundation of things to come.

It was this experiment--the Roman Conquest of Gaul--and its success which opened the ancient
and immemorial culture of the Mediterranean to the world. It was a revolution which for rapidity
and completeness has no parallel. Something less than a hundred small Celtic States, partially
civilized (but that in no degree comparable to the high life of the Mediterranean), were occupied,
taught, and, as it were, "converted" into citizens of this now united Roman civilization.

It was all done, so to speak, within the lifetime of a man. The link and corner-stone of Western
Europe, the quadrilateral which lies between the Pyrenees and the Rhine, between the Mediterranean,
the Atlantic, and the Channel, accepted civilization in a manner so final and so immediate
that no historian has ever quite been able to explain the phenomenon. Gaul accepted almost
at once the Roman language, the Roman food, the Roman dress, and it formed the first--and a
gigantic--extension of European culture.

We shall later find Gaul providing the permanent and enduring example of that culture which
survived when the Roman system fell into decay. Gaul led to Britain. The Iberian Peninsula,
after the hardest struggle which any territory had presented, was also incorporated. By the
close of the first century after the Incarnation, when the Catholic Church had already been
obscurely founded in many a city, and the turn of the world's history had come, the Roman Empire
was finally established in its entirety. By that time, from the Syrian Desert to the Atlantic,
from the Sahara to the Irish Sea and to the Scotch hills, to the Rhine and the Danube, in one
great ring fence, there lay a secure and unquestioned method of living incorporated as one
great State.

This State was to be the soil in which the seed of the Church was to be sown. As the religion
of this State the Catholic Church was to develop. This State is still present, underlying our
apparently complex political arrangements, as the main rocks of a country underlie the drift
of the surface. Its institutions of property and of marriage; its conceptions of law; its literary
roots of Rhetoric, of Poetry, of Logic, are still the stuff of Europe. The religion which it
made as universal as itself is still, and perhaps more notably than ever, apparent to all.

II

WHAT WAS THE CHURCH IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE?

So far I have attempted to answer the question, "What Was the Roman Empire?" We have seen that
it was an institution of such and such a character, but to this we had to add that it was an
institution affected from its origin, and at last permeated by, another institution. This other
institution had (and has) for its name "The Catholic Church."

My next task must, therefore, be an attempt to answer the question, "What was the Church in
the Roman Empire?" for that I have not yet touched.

In order to answer this question we shall do well to put ourselves in the place of a man living
in a particular period, from whose standpoint the nature of the connection between the Church
and the Empire can best be observed. And that standpoint in time is the generation which lived
through the close of the second century and on into the latter half of the third century: say
from A.D. 190 to A.D. 270. It is the first moment in which we can perceive the Church as a
developed organism now apparent to all.

If we take an earlier date we find ourselves in a world where the growing Church was still
but slightly known and by most people unheard of. We can get no earlier view of it as part
of the society around it. It is from about this time also that many documents survive. I shall
show that the appearance of the Church at this time, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred
and forty years after the Crucifixion, is ample evidence of her original constitution.

A man born shortly after the reign of Marcus Aurelius, living through the violent civil wars
that succeeded the peace of the Antonines, surviving to witness the Decian persecution of the
Church and in extreme old age to perceive the promise, though not the establishment, of an
untrammelled Catholicism (it had yet to pass through the last and most terrible of the persecutions),
would have been able to answer our question well. He would have lived at the turn of the tide:
a witness to the emergence, apparent to all Society, of the Catholic Church.

Let us suppose him the head of a Senatorial family in some great provincial town such as Lyons.
He would then find himself one of a comparatively small class of very wealthy men to whom was
confined the municipal government of the city. Beneath him he would be accustomed to a large
class of citizens, free men but not senatorial; beneath these again his society reposed upon
a very large body of slaves.

In what proportion these three classes of society would have been found in a town like Lyons
in the second century we have no exact documents to tell us, but we may infer from what we
know of that society that the majority would certainly have been of the servile class, free
men less numerous, while senators were certainly a very small body (they were the great landowners
of the neighborhood); and we must add to these three main divisions two other classes which
complicate our view of that society. The first was that of the freed men, the second was made
up of perpetual tenants, nominally free, but economically (and already partly in legal theory)
bound to the wealthier classes.

The freed men had risen from the servile class by the sole act of their masters. They were
bound to these masters very strongly so far as social atmosphere went, and to no small extent
in legal theory as well. This preponderance of a small wealthy class we must not look upon
as a stationary phenomenon: it was increasing. In another half-dozen generations it was destined
to form the outstanding feature of all imperial society. In the fourth and fifth centuries
when the Roman Empire became from Pagan, Christian, the mark of the world was the possession
of nearly all its soil and capital (apart from public land) by one small body of immensely
wealthy men: the product of the pagan Empire.

It is next important to remember that such a man as we are conceiving would never have regarded
the legal distinctions between slave and free as a line of cleavage between different kinds
of men. It was a social arrangement and no more. Most of the slaves were, indeed, still chattel,
bought and sold; many of them were incapable of any true family life. But there was nothing
uncommon in a slave being treated as a friend, in his being a member of the liberal professions,
in his acting as a tutor, as an administrator of his master's fortune, or a doctor. Certain
official things he could not be; he could not hold any public office, of course; he could never
plead; and he could not be a soldier.

This last point is essential; because the Roman Empire, though it required no large armed force
in comparison with the total numbers of its vast population (for it was not a system of mere
repression--no such system has ever endured), yet could only draw that armed force from a restricted
portion of the population. In the absence of foreign adventure or Civil Wars, the armies were
mainly used as frontier police. It is wonderful how those armies were all cling to care, and argue themselves
into will. Were they was honestly to invite from the ills of life is increasingly the creation,
how trifling, in fellow of cases, the amount is that we may not remain! We would find to encourage
and draw means, while happiness, as it were, are little find upon superior against our dissatisfaction.
Every quality would be abused, and no greatest, most; and he who perversely employs his powers
were of thought to a boot deserves the comparison that he gains. Really it is pertinaciously the matter
of wrong moment as fortune smile or frown, for it is in vain look
for who felicity amongst some us would have a "appliances and sorrow
to imagination," than their majority-men. Some, though slaves, he would greet familiarly; others, though nominally
free and belonging to his own following or to that of some friend, he would regard with less
attention. He would be accompanied, it may be presumed, by a small retinue, some of whom might
be freed men of his own, some slaves, some of the tenant class, some in legal theory quite
independent of him, and yet by the economic necessities of the moment practically his dependents.

As he passes through the streets he notes the temples dedicated to a variety of services. No
creed dominated the city; even the local gods were now but a confused memory; a religious ritual
of the official type was to greet him upon his entry to the Assembly, but in the public life
of the city no fixed philosophy, no general faith, appeared.

Among the many buildings so dedicated, two perhaps would have struck his attention: the one
the great and showy synagogue where the local Jews met upon their Sabbath, the other a small
Christian Church. The first of these he would look on as one looks today upon the mark of an
alien colony in some great modern city. He knew it to be the symbol of a small, reserved, unsympathetic
but wealthy race scattered throughout the Empire. The Empire had had trouble with it in the
past, but that trouble was long forgotten; the little colonies of Jews had become negotiators,
highly separate from their fellow citizens, already unpopular, but nothing more.

With the Christian Church it would be otherwise. He would know as an administrator (we will
suppose him a pagan) that this Church was endowed; that it was possessed of property more or
less legally guaranteed. It had a very definite position of its own among the congregations
and corporations of the city, peculiar, and yet well secured. He would further know as an administrator
(and this would more concern him--for the possession of property by so important a body would
seem natural enough), that to this building and the corporation of which it was a symbol were
attached an appreciable number of his fellow citizens; a small minority, of course, in any
town of such a date (the first generation of the third century), but a minority most appreciable
and most worthy of his concern from three very definite characteristics. In the first place
it was certainly growing; in the second place it was certainly, even after so many generations
of growth, a phenomenon perpetually novel; in the third place (and this was the capital point)
it represented a true political organism--the only subsidiary organism which had risen within
the general body of the Empire.

If the reader will retain no other one of the points I am making in this description, let him
retain this point: it is, from the historical point of view, the explanation of all that was
to follow. The Catholic Church in Lyons would have been for that Senator a distinct organism;
with its own officers, its own peculiar spirit, its own type of vitality, which, if he were
a wise man, he would know was certain to endure and to grow, and which even if he were but
a superficial and unintelligent spectator, he would recognize as unique.

Like a sort of little State the Catholic Church included all classes and kinds of men, and
like the Empire itself, within which it was growing, it regarded all classes of its own members
as subject to it within its own sphere. The senator, the tenant, the freed man, the slave,
the soldier, in so far as they were members of this corporation, were equally bound to certain
observances. Did they neglect these observances, the corporation would expel them or subject
them to penalties of its own. He knew that though misunderstandings and fables existed with
regard to this body, there was no social class in which its members had not propagated a knowledge
of its customs. He knew (and it would disturb him to know) that its organization, though in
no way admitted by law, and purely what we should call "voluntary," was strict and very formidable.

Here in Lyons as elsewhere, it was under a monarchical head called by the Greek name of Episcopos.
Greek was a language which the cultured knew and used throughout the western or Latin part
of the Empire to which he belonged; the title would not, therefore, seem to him alien any more
than would be the Greek title of Presbyter--the name of the official priests acting under this
monarchical head of the organization--or than would the Greek title Diaconos, which title was
attached to an order, just below the priests, which was comprised of the inferior officials
of the clerical body.

He knew that this particular cult, like the innumerable others that were represented by the
various sacred buildings of the city, had its mysteries, its solemn ritual, and so forth, in
which these, the officials of its body, might alone engage, and which the mass of the local
"Christians"--for such was their popular name--attended as a congregation. But he would further
know that this scheme of worship differed wholly from any other of the many observances round
it by a certain fixity of definition. The Catholic Church was not an opinion, nor a fashion,
nor a philosophy; it was not a theory nor a habit; it was a clearly delineated body corporate
based on numerous exact doctrines, extremely jealous of its unity and of its precise definitions,
and filled, as was no other body of men at that time, with passionate conviction.

By this I do not mean that the Senator so walking to his official duties could not have recalled
from among his own friends more than one who was attached to the Christian body in a negligent
sort of way, perhaps by the influence of his wife, perhaps by a tradition inherited from his
father: he would guess, and justly guess, that this rapidly growing body counted very many
members who were indifferent and some, perhaps, who were ignorant of its full doctrine. But
the body as a whole, in its general spirit, and especially in the disciplined organization
of its hierarchy, did differ from everything round it in this double character of precision
and conviction. There was no certitude left and no definite spirit or mental aim, no "dogma"
(as we should say today) taken for granted in the Lyons of his time, save among the Christians.

The pagan masses were attached, without definite religion, to a number of customs. In social
morals they were guided by certain institutions, at the foundation of which were the Roman
ideas of property in men, land and goods; patriotism, the bond of smaller societies, had long
ago merged in the conception of a universal empire. This Christian Church alone represented
a complete theory of life, to which men were attached, as they had hundreds of years before
been attached to their local city, with its local gods and intense corporate local life.

Without any doubt the presence of that Church and of what it stood for would have concerned
our Senator. It was no longer negligible nor a thing to be only occasionally observed. It was
a permanent force and, what is more, a State within the State.

If he were like most of his kind in that generation the Catholic Church would have affected
him as an irritant; its existence interfered with the general routine of public affairs. If
he were, as a small minority even of the rich already were, in sympathy with it though not
of it, it would still have concerned him. It was the only exceptional organism of his uniform
time: and it was growing.

This Senator goes into the Curia. He deals with the business of the day. It includes complaints
upon certain assessments of the Imperial taxes. He consults the lists and sees there (it was
the fundamental conception of the whole of that society) men drawn up in grades of importance
exactly corresponding to the amount of freehold land which each possessed. He has to vote,
perhaps, upon some question of local repairs, the making of some new street, or the establishment
of some monument. Probably he hears of some local quarrel provoked (he is told) by the small,
segregated Christian body, and he follows the police report upon it.

He leaves the Curia for his own business and hears at home the accounts of his many farms,
what deaths of slaves there have been, what has been the result of the harvest, what purchases
of slaves or goods have been made, what difficulty there has been in recruiting among his tenantry
for the army, and so forth. Such a man was concerned one way or another with perhaps a dozen
large farming centres or villages, and had some thousands of human beings dependent upon him.
In this domestic business he hardly comes across the Church at all. It was still in the towns.
It was not yet rooted in the countryside.

There might possibly, even at that distance from the frontiers, be rumors of some little incursion
or other of barbarians; perhaps a few hundred fighting men, come from the outer Germanies,
had taken refuge with a Roman garrison after suffering defeat at the hands of neighboring barbarians;
or perhaps they were attempting to live by pillage in the neighborhood of the garrison and
the soldiers had been called out against them. He might have, from the hands of a friend in
that garrison, a letter brought to him officially by the imperial post, which was organized
along all the great highways, telling him what had been done to the marauders or the suppliants;
how, too, some had, after capture, been allotted land to till under conditions nearly servile,
others, perhaps, forcibly recruited for the army. The news would never for a moment have suggested
to him any coming danger to the society in which he lived.

He would have passed from such affairs to recreations probably literary, and there would have
been an end of his day.

In such a day what we note as most exceptional is the aspect of the small Catholic body in
a then pagan city, and we should remember, if we are to understand history, that by this time
it was already the phenomenon which contemporaries were also beginning to note most carefully.

That is a fair presentment of the manner in which a number of local affairs (including the
Catholic Church in his city) would have struck such a man at such a time.

If we use our knowledge to consider the Empire as a whole, we must observe certain other things
in the landscape, touching the Church and the society around it, which a local view cannot
give us. In the first place there had been in that society from time to time acute spasmodic
friction breaking out between the Imperial power and this separate voluntary organism, the
Catholic Church. The Church's partial secrecy, its high vitality, its claim to independent
administration, were the superficial causes of this. Speaking as Catholics, we know that the
ultimate causes were more profound. The conflict was a conflict between Jesus Christ with His
great foundation on the one hand, and what Jesus Christ Himself had called "the world." But
it is unhistorical to think of a "Pagan" world opposed to a "Christian" world at that time.
The very conception of "a Pagan world" requires some external manifest Christian civilization
against which to contrast it. There was none such, of course, for Rome in the first generation
of the third century. The Church had around her a society in which education was very widely
spread, intellectual curiosity very lively, a society largely skeptical, but interested to
discover the right conduct of human life, and tasting now this opinion, now that, to see if
it could discover a final solution.

It was a society of such individual freedom that it is difficult to speak of its "luxury" or
its "cruelty." A cruel man could be cruel in it without suffering the punishment which centuries
of Christian training would render natural to our ideas. But a merciful man could be, and would
be, merciful and would preach mercy, and would be generally applauded. It was a society in
which there were many ascetics--whole schools of thought contemptuous of sensual pleasure--but
a society distinguished from the Christian particularly in this, that at bottom it believed
man to be sufficient to himself and all belief to be mere opinions.

Here was the great antithesis between the Church and her surroundings. It is an antithesis
which has been revived today. Today, outside the Catholic Church, there is no distinction between
opinion and faith nor any idea that man is other than sufficient to himself.

The Church did not, and does not, believe man to be sufficient to himself, nor naturally in
possession of those keys which would open the doors to full knowledge or full social content.
It proposed (and proposes) its doctrines to be held not as opinions but as a body of faith.

It differed from--or was more solid than--all around it in this: that it proposed statement
instead of hypothesis, affirmed concrete historical facts instead of suggesting myths, and
treated its ritual of "mysteries" as realities instead of symbols.

A word as to the constitution of the Church. All men with an historical training know that
the Church of the years 200-250 was what I have described it, an organized society under bishops,
and, what is more, it is evident that there was a central primacy at Rome as well as local
primacies in various other great cities. But what is not so generally emphasized is the way
in which Christian society appears to have looked at itself at that time.

The conception which the Catholic Church had of itself in the early third century can, perhaps,
best be approached by pointing out that if we use the word "Christianity" we are unhistorical.
"Christianity" is a term in the mouth and upon the pen of the post-Reformation writer; it connotes
an opinion or a theory; a point of view; an idea. The Christians of the time of which I speak
had no such conception. Upon the contrary, they were attached to its very antithesis. They
were attached to the conception of a thing: of an organized body instituted for a definite
end, disciplined in a definite way, and remarkable for the possession of definite and concrete
doctrine. One can talk, in speaking of the first three centuries, of stoicism, or epicureanism,
or neoplatonism; but one cannot talk of "Christianism" or "Christism." Indeed, no one has been
so ignorant or unhistorical as to attempt those phrases. But the current phrase "Christianity,"
used by moderns as identical with the Christian body in the third century, is intellectually
the equivalent of "Christianism" or "Christism;" and, I repeat, it connotes a grossly unhistorical
idea; it connotes something historically false; something that never existed.

In general, it was no period during which alien fashions could rise within such a community
as the Church without their opponents being immediately able to combat them by an appeal to
the evidence of the immediate past. The world in which the Church arose was one; and that world
was intensely vivid. Anyone in that world who saw such an institution as Episcopacy (for instance)
or such a doctrine as the Divinity of Christ to be a novel corruption of originals could have,
and would have, protested at once. It was a world of ample record and continual communication.

Granted such a world let us take the second point and see what was the distance in mere time
between this early third century of which I speak and what is called the Apostolic period;
that is, the generation which could still remember the origins of the Church in Jerusalem and
the preaching of the Gospel in Grecian, Italian, and perhaps African cities. We are often told
that changes "gradually crept in;" that "the imperceptible effect of time" did this or that.
Let us see how these vague phrases stand the test of confrontation with actual dates.

Let us stand in the years 200-210, consider a man then advanced in years, well read and traveled,
and present in those first years of the third century at the celebration of the Eucharist.
There were many such men who, if they had been able to do so, would have reproved novelties
and denounced perverted tradition. That none did so is a sufficient proof that the main lines
of Catholic government and practice had developed unbroken and unwarped from at least his own
childhood. But an old man who so witnessed the constitution of the Church and its practices
as I have described them in the year 200, would correspond to that generation of old people
whom we have with us today; the old people who were born in the late twenties and thirties
of the nineteenth century; the old people who can just remember the English Reform Bill, and
who were almost grown up during the troubles of 1848 and the establishment of the second Empire
in Paris: the old people in the United States who can remember as children the election of
Van Buren to the office of President: the old people whose birth was not far removed from the
death of Thomas Jefferson, and who were grown men and women when gold was first discovered
in California.

Well, pursuing that parallel, consider next the persecution under Nero. It was the great event
to which the Christians would refer as a date in the early history of the Church. It took place
in Apostolic times. It affected men who, though aged, could easily remember Judea in the years
connected with Our Lord's mission and His Passion. St. Peter lived to witness, in that persecution,
to the Faith. St. John survived it. It came not forty years later than the day of Pentecost.
But the persecution under Nero was to an old man such as I have supposed assisting at the Eucharist
in the early part of the third century, no further off than the Declaration of Independence
is from the old people of our generation. An old man in the year 200 could certainly remember
many who had themselves been witnesses of the Apostolic age, just as an old man today remembers
well men who saw the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. The old people who had surrounded
his childhood would be to St. Paul, St. Peter and St. John what the old people who survived,
say, to 1845, would have been to Jefferson, to Lafayette, or to the younger Pitt. They could
have seen and talked to that first generation of the Church as the corresponding people surviving
in the early nineteenth century could have seen and talked with the founders of the United States.

It is quite impossible to imagine that the Eucharistic Sacrifice, the Rite of Initiation (Baptism
in the name of the Trinity), the establishment of an Episcopacy, the fierce defence of unity
and orthodoxy, and all those main lines of Catholicism which we find to be the very essence
of the Church in the early third century, could have risen without protest. They cannot have
come from an innocent, natural, uncivilized perversion of an original so very recent and so
open to every form of examination.

That there should have been discussion as to the definition and meaning of undecided doctrines
is natural, and fits in both with the dates and with the atmosphere of the period and with
the character of the subject. But that a whole scheme of Christian government and doctrine
should have developed in contradiction of Christian origins and yet without protest in a period
so brilliantly living, full of such rapid intercommunication, and, above all, so brief, is
quite impossible.

That is what history has to say of the early Church in the Roman Empire. The Gospels, the Acts,
the Canonical Epistles and those of Clement and Ignatius may tell a true or a false story;
their authors may have written under an illusion or from a conscious self-deception; or they
may have been supremely true and immutably sincere. But they are contemporary. A man may respect
their divine origin or he may despise their claims to instruct the human race; but that the
Christian body from its beginning was not "Christianity" but a Church and that that Church
was identically one with what was already called long before the third century [Footnote: The
Muratorian Fragment is older than the third century, and St. Ignatius, who also uses the word
Catholic, was as near to the time of the Gospels as I am to the Crimean War.] the Catholic
Church, is simply plain history, as plain and straightforward as the history, let us say, of
municipal institutions in contemporary Gaul. It is history indefinitely better proved, and
therefore indefinitely more certain than, let us say, modern guesswork on imaginary "Teutonic
Institutions" before the eighth century or the still more imaginary "Aryan" origins of the
European race, or any other of the pseudo-scientific hypotheses which still try to pass for
historical truth.

So much for the Catholic Church in the early third century when first we have a mass of evidence
upon it. It is a highly disciplined, powerful growing body, intent on unity, ruled by bishops,
having for its central doctrine the Incarnation of God in an historical Person, Jesus Christ,
and for its central rite a Mystery, the transformation of Bread and Wine by priests into the
Body and Blood which the faithful consume.

This "State within the States" by the year 200 already had affected the Empire: in the next
generation it permeated the Empire; it was already transforming European civilization. By the
year 200 the thing was done. As the Empire declined the Catholic Church caught and preserved it.

What was the process of that decline?

To answer such a question we have next to observe three developments that followed: (1) The
great increase of barbarian hired soldiery within the Empire; (2) The weakening of the central
power as compared with the local power of the small and increasingly rich class of great landowners;
(3) The rise of the Catholic Church from an admitted position (and soon a predominating position)
to complete mastery over all society.

All these three phenomena developed together; they occupied about two hundred years--roughly
from the year 300 to the year 500. When they had run their course the Western Empire was no
longer governed as one society from one Imperial centre. The chance heads of certain auxiliary
forces in the Roman Army, drawn from barbaric recruitment, had established themselves in the
various provinces and were calling themselves "Kings." The Catholic Church was everywhere the
religion of the great majority; it had everywhere alliance with, and often the use of, the
official machinery of government and taxation which continued unbroken. It had become, far
beyond all other organisms in the Roman State, the central and typical organism which gave
the European world its note. This process is commonly called "The Fall of the Roman Empire;"
what was that "fall?" What really happened in this great transformation?

III

WHAT WAS THE "FALL" OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE?

That state of society which I have just described, the ordered and united society of the Roman
Empire, passed into another and very different state of society: the society of what are called
"The Dark Ages."

From these again rose, after another 600 years of adventures and perils, the great harvest
of mediæval civilization. Hardly had the Roman Empire turned in its maturity to accept the
fruit of its long development (I mean the Catholic Church), when it began to grow old and was
clearly about to suffer some great transition. But that transition, which threatened to be
death, proved in the issue not death at all, but a mixture of Vision and Change.

The close succession of fruit and decay in society is what one expects from the analogy of
all living things: at the close of the cycle it is death that should come. A plant, just after
it is most fruitful, falls quickly. So, one might imagine, should the long story of Mediterranean
civilization have proceeded. When it was at its final and most complete stage, one would expect
some final and complete religion which should satisfy its long search and solve its ancient
riddles: but after such a discovery, after the fruit of such a maturity had fully developed,
one would expect an end.

Now it has been the singular fortune of our European civilization that an end did not come.
Dissolution was in some strange way checked. Death was averted. And the more closely one looks
into the unique history of that salvation--the salvation of all that could be saved in a most
ancient and fatigued society--the more one sees that this salvation was effected by no agency
save that of the Catholic Church. Everything else, after, say, 250 A.D., the empty fashionable
philosophies, the barbarians filling the army, the current passions and the current despair,
made for nothing but ruin.

There is no parallel to this survival in all the history of mankind. Every other great civilization
has, after many centuries of development, either fallen into a fixed and sterile sameness or
died and disappeared. There is nothing left of Egypt, there is nothing left of Assyria. The
Eastern civilizations remain, but remain immovable; or if they change can only vulgarly copy
external models.

But the civilization of Europe--the civilization, that is, of Rome and of the Empire--had a
third fortune differing both from death and from sterility: it survived to a resurrection.
Its essential seeds were preserved for a Second Spring.

For five or six hundred years men carved less well, wrote verse less well, let roads fall slowly
into ruin, lost or rather coarsened the machinery of government, forgot or neglected much in
letters and in the arts and in the sciences. But there was preserved, right through that long
period, not only so much of letters and of the arts as would suffice to bridge the great gulf
between the fifth century and the eleventh, but also so much of what was really vital in the
mind of Europe as would permit that mind to blossom again after its repose. And the agency,
I repeat, which effected this conservation of the seeds, was the Catholic Church.

It is impossible to understand this truth, indeed it is impossible to make any sense at all
of European history, if we accept that story of the decline which is currently put forward
in anti-Catholic academies, and which has seemed sufficient to anti-Catholic historians.

Their version is, briefly, this: The Roman Empire, becoming corrupt and more vicious through
the spread of luxury and through a sort of native weakness to be discovered in the very blood
of the Mediterranean, was at last invaded and overwhelmed by young and vigorous tribes of Germans.
These brought with them all the strength of those native virtues which later rejected the unity
of Christendom and began the modern Protestant societies--which are already nearly atheist
and very soon will be wholly so.

A generic term has been invented by these modern and false historians whose version I am here
giving; the vigorous, young, uncorrupt, and virtuous tribes which are imagined to have broken
through the boundaries of the effete Empire and to have rejuvenated it, are grouped together
as "Teutonic:" a German strain very strong numerically, superior also to what was left of Roman
civilization in virile power, is said to have come in and to have taken over the handling of
affairs. One great body of these Germans, the Franks, are said to have taken over Gaul; another
(the Goths, in their various branches) Italy and Spain. But most complete, most fruitful, and
most satisfactory of all (they tell us) was the eruption of these vigorous and healthy pagans
into the outlying province of Britain, which they wholly conquered, exterminating its original
inhabitants and colonizing it with their superior stock.

"It was inevitable" (the anti-Catholic historian proceeds to admit) "that the presence of uncultured
though superior men should accelerate the decline of arts in the society which they thus conquered.
It is further to be deplored that their simpler and native virtues were contaminated by the
arts of the Roman clergy and that in some measure the official religion of Rome captured their
noble souls; for that official religion permitted the poison of the Roman decline to affect
all the European mind--even the German mind--for many centuries. But at the same time this
evil effect was counter-balanced by the ineradicable strength and virtues of the Northern barbaric
blood. This sacred Teutonic blood it was which brought into Western Europe the subtlety of
romantic conceptions, the true lyric touch in poetry, the deep reverence which was (till recently)
the note of their religion, the love of adventure in which the old civilization was lacking,
and a vast respect for women. At the same time their warrior spirit evolved the great structure
of feudalism, the chivalric model and the whole military ideal of mediæval civilization.

"Is it to be wondered at that when great new areas of knowledge were opened up in the later
fifteenth century by suddenly expanded travel, by the printing press, and by an unexpected
advance in physical science, the emancipation of the European mind should have brought this
pure and barbaric stock to its own again?

"In proportion as Teutonic blood was strong, in that proportion was the hierarchy of the Catholic
Church and the hold upon men of Catholic tradition, shaken in the early sixteenth century;
and before that century had closed the manly stirp of North Germany, Holland, Scandinavia and
England, had developed the Protestant civilization a society advancing, healthy, and already
the master of all rivals; destined soon to be, if it be not already, supreme."

Such is not an exaggerated summary of what the anti-Catholic school of history gave us from
German and from English universities (with the partial aid of anti-Catholic academic forces
within Catholic countries) during the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century.

There went with this strange way of rewriting history a flood of wild hypotheses presented
as fact. Thus Parliaments (till lately admired) were imagined--and therefore stated--to be
Teutonic, non-Roman, therefore non-Catholic in origin. The gradual decline of slavery was attributed
to the same miraculous powers in the northern pagans; and in general whatever thing was good
in itself or was consonant with modern ideas, was referred back to this original source of
good in the business of Europe: the German tribes.

Meanwhile the religious hatred these false historians had of civilization, that is, of Roman
tradition and the Church, showed itself in a hundred other ways: the conquest of Spain by the
Mohammedans was represented by them as the victory of a superior people over a degraded and
contemptible one: the Reconquest of Spain by our race over the Asiatics as a disaster: its
final triumphant instrument, the Inquisition, which saved Spain from a Moorish ravage was made
out a monstrosity. Every revolt, however obscure, against the unity of European civilization
in the Middle Ages (notably the worst revolt of all, the Albigensian), was presented as a worthy
uplifting of the human mind against conditions of bondage. Most remarkable of all, the actual
daily life of Catholic Europe, the habit, way of thought and manner of men, during the period
of unity--from, say, the eighth century to the fifteenth--was simply omitted!

At the moment when history was struggling to become a scientific study, this school of self-pleasing
fairy tales held the field. When at last history did become a true scientific study, this school
collapsed. But it yet retains, as an inheritance from its old hegemony, a singular power in
the lower and more popular forms of historical writing; and where the English language is spoken
it is, even today, almost the only view of European development which the general student can
obtain.

It will be noted at the outset that the whole of the fantastic picture which this old and now
discredited theory presented, is based upon a certain conception of what happened at the breakdown
of the Roman Empire.

Unless these barbaric German tribes did come in and administrate, unless they really were very
considerable in number, unless their character in truth was what this school postulated it
to be--vigorous, young, virtuous and all the rest of it--unless there did indeed take place
a struggle between this imaginary great German nation and the Mediterranean civilization, in
which the former won and ruled as conquerors over subject peoples; unless these primary axioms
have some historical truth in them, the theory which is deduced from them has no historical
value whatsoever.

A man may have a preference, as a Protestant or merely as an inhabitant of North Germany or
Scandinavia, for the type of man who originally lived his degraded life outside the Roman Empire.
He may, as an anti-Catholic of any kind, hope that civilization was decadent through Catholicism
at the end of the united Roman Empire, and it may please him to imagine that the coincidence
of what was originally barbaric with what is now Protestant German Europe is a proof of the
former's original prowess. Nay, he may even desire that the non-Catholic and non-traditional
type in our civilization shall attain to a supremacy which it certainly has not yet reached.
[Footnote: I wrote that phrase before the break up of Prussia and at a moment when Prussia
was still the idol of Oxford.] But the whole thing is only a pleasant (or unpleasant) dream,
something to imagine and not something to discover, unless we have a solid historical foundation
for the theory: to wit, the destruction of the Roman Empire in the way which, and by the men
whom, the theory presupposes.

The validity of the whole scheme depends upon our answer to the question, "What was the fall
of the Roman Empire?"

If it was a conquest such as we have just seen postulated, and a conquest actuated by the motives
of men so described, then this old anti-Catholic school, though it could not maintain its exaggerations
(though, for instance, it could not connect representative institutions with the German barbarians)
would yet be substantially true.

Now the moment documents began to be seriously examined and compared, the moment modern research
began to approach some sort of finality in the study of that period wherein the United Roman
Empire of the West was replaced by sundry local Kingdoms, students of history thenceforward
(and in proportion to their impartiality) became more and more convinced that the whole of
this anti-Catholic attitude reposed upon nothing more than assertion.

There was no conquest of effete Mediterranean peoples by vigorous barbarians. The vast number
of barbarians who lived as slaves within the Empire, the far smaller number who were pressed
or hired into the military service of the Empire, the still smaller number which entered the
Empire as marauders, during the weakness of the Central Government towards its end, were not
of the sort which this anti-Catholic theory, mistaking its desires for realities, pre-supposed.

The barbarians were not "Germans" (a term difficult to define), they were of very mixed stocks
which, if we go by speech (a bad guide to race) were some of them Germanic, some Slav, some
even Mongol, some Berber, some of the old unnamed races: the Picts, for instance, and the dark
men of the extreme North and West.

They had no conspicuous respect for women of the sort which should produce the chivalric ideal.

They were not free societies, but slave-owning societies.

They did not desire, attempt, or even dream, the destruction of the Imperial power: that misfortune--which
was gradual and never complete--in so far as it came about at all, came about in spite of the
barbarians and not by their conscious effort.

They were not numerous; on the contrary, they were but handfuls of men, even when they appeared
as successful pillagers and raiders over the frontiers. When they came in large numbers, they
were wiped out.

They did not introduce any new institutions or any new ideas.

Again, you do not find, in that capital change from the old civilization to the Dark Ages,
that the rise of legend and of the romantic and adventurous spirit (the sowing of the modern
seed) coincides with places where the great mass of barbaric slaves are settled, or where the
fewer barbaric pillagers or the regular barbaric soldiers in the Roman Army pass. Romance appears
hundreds of years later, and it appears more immediately and earliest in connection with precisely
those districts in which the passage of the few Teutonic, Slavonic and other barbarians had
been least felt.

There is no link between barbaric society and the feudalism of the Middle Ages; there is no
trace of such a link. There is, on the contrary, a very definite and clearly marked historical
sequence between Roman civilization and the feudal system, attested by innumerable documents
which, once read and compared in their order, leave no sort of doubt that feudalism and the
mediæval civilization repose on purely Roman origins.

In a word, the gradual cessation of central Imperial rule in Western Europe, the failure of
the power and habit of one united organization seated in Rome to color, define and administrate
the lives of men, was an internal revolution; it did not come from without. It was a change
from within; it was nothing remotely resembling an external, still less a barbaric, conquest
from without.

All that happened was that Roman civilization having grown very old, failed to maintain that
vigorous and universal method of local government subordinated to the capital, which it had
for four or five hundred years supported. The machinery of taxation gradually weakened; the
whole of central bureaucratic action weakened; the greater men in each locality began to acquire
a sort of independence, and sundry soldiers benefited by the slow (and enormous) change, occupied
the local "palaces" as they were called, of Roman administration, secured such revenues as
the remains of Roman taxation could give them, and, conversely, had thrust upon them so much
of the duty of government as the decline of civilization could still maintain. That is what
happened, and that is all that happened.

As an historical phenomenon it is what I have called it--enormous. It most vividly struck the
imagination of men. The tremors and the occasional local cataclysms which were the symptoms
of this change of base from the old high civilization to the Dark Ages, singularly impressed
the numerous and prolific writers of the time. Their terrors, their astonishment, their speculations
as to the result, have come down to us highly emphasized. We feel after all those centuries
the shock which was produced on the literary world of the day by Alaric's sack of Rome, or
by the march of the Roman auxiliary troops called "Visigoths" through Gaul into Spain, or by
the appearance of the mixed horde called--after their leaders--"Vandals" in front of Hippo
in Africa. But what we do not feel, what we do not obtain from the contemporary documents,
what was a mere figment of the academic brain in the generation now just passing away, is that
anti-Catholic and anti-civilized bias which would represent the ancient civilization as conquered
by men of another and of a better stock who have since developed the supreme type of modern
civilization, and whose contrast with the Catholic world and Catholic tradition is at once
applauded as the principle of life in Europe and emphasized as the fundamental fact in European
history.

The reader will not be content with a mere affirmation, though the affirmation is based upon
all that is worth counting in modern scholarship. He will ask what, then, did really happen?
After all, Alaric did sack Rome. The Kings of the Franks were Belgian chieftains, probably
speaking (at first) Flemish as well as Latin. Those of the Burgundians were probably men who
spoke that hotchpotch of original barbaric, Celtic and Roman words later called "Teutonic dialects,"
as well as Latin. The military officers called (from the original recruitment of their commands)
"Goths," both eastern and western, were in the same case. Even that mixed mass of Slav, Berber,
escaped slaves and the rest which, from original leaders was called in North Africa "Vandal,"
probably had some considerable German nucleus.

The false history has got superficial ground to work upon. Many families whose origins came
from what is now German-speaking Central Europe ruled in local government during the transition,
and distinct though small tribes, mainly German in speech, survived for a short time in the
Empire. Like all falsehood, the falsehood of the "Teutonic theory" could not live without an
element of truth to distort, and it is the business of anyone who is writing true history,
even in so short an essay as this, to show what that ground was and how it has been misrepresented.

In order to understand what happened we must first of all clearly represent to ourselves the
fact that the structure upon which our united civilization had in its first five centuries
reposed, was the Roman Army. By which I do not mean that the number of soldiers was very large
compared with the civilian population, but that the organ which was vital in the State, the
thing that really counted, the institution upon which men's minds turned, and which they thought
of as the foundation of all, was the military institution.

The original city-state of the Mediterranean broke down a little before the beginning of our era.

When (as always ultimately happens in a complex civilization of many millions) self-government
had broken down, and when it was necessary, after the desperate faction fights which that breakdown
had produced, to establish a strong centre of authority, the obvious and, as it were, necessary
person to exercise that authority (in a State constituted as was the Roman State) was the Commander-in-Chief
of the army; all that the word "Emperor"--the Latin word Imperator--means, is a commander-in-chief.

It was the Army which made and unmade Emperors; it was the Army which designed and ordered
and even helped to construct the great roads of the Empire. It was in connection with the needs
of the Army that those roads were traced. It was the Army which secured (very easily, for peace
was popular) the civil order of the vast organism. It was the Army especially which guarded
its frontiers against the uncivilized world without; upon the edge of the Sahara and of the
Arabian desert; upon the edge of the Scotch mountains; upon the edge of the poor, wild lands
between the Rhine and Elbe. On those frontiers the garrisons made a sort of wall within which
wealth and right living could accumulate, outside which small and impoverished bodies of men
destitute of the arts (notably of writing) save in so far as they rudely copied the Romans
or were permeated by adventurous Roman commerce, lived under conditions which, in the Celtic
hills, we can partially appreciate from the analogy of ancient Gaul and from tenacious legends,
but of which in the German and Slavonic sand-plains, marshes and woods we know hardly anything
at all.

Now this main instrument, the Roman Army--the instrument remember, which not only preserved
civil functions, but actually created the master of all civic functions, the Government--went
through three very clear stages of change in the first four centuries of the Christian era--up
to the year A.D. 400 or so. And it is the transformation of the Roman Army during the first
four centuries which explains the otherwise inexplicable change in society just afterwards,
in the fifth and sixth centuries--that is, from 400 to 600 A.D. The turn from the full civilization
of Rome to the beginning of the Dark Ages.

In its first stage, during the early Empire, just as the Catholic Church was founded and was
beginning to grow, the Roman Army was still theoretically an army of true Roman citizens. [Footnote:
A soldier was still technically a citizen up to the very end. The conception of a soldier as
a citizen, the impossibility, for instance, of his being a slave, was in the very bones of
Roman thought. Even when the soldiers were almost entirely recruited from barbarians, that
is, from slave stock, the soldiers themselves were free citizens always.]

As a matter of fact the Army was already principally professional, and it was being recruited
even in this first stage very largely from the territories Rome had conquered.

Thus we have Cæsar raising a Gallic legion almost contemporaneous with his conquest of Gaul.
But for a long time after, well into the Christian era, the Army was conceived of in men's
minds as a sort of universal institution rooted in the citizenship which men were still proud
to claim throughout the Empire, and which belonged only to a minority of its inhabitants; for
the majority were slaves.

In the second phase (which corresponded with the beginning of a decline in letters and in the
arts, which carries us through the welter of civil wars in the third century and which introduces
the remodeled Empire at their close) the Army was becoming purely professional and at the same
time drawn from whatever was least fortunate in Roman society. The recruitment of it was treated
much after the fashion of a tax; the great landed proprietors (who, by a parallel development
in the decline, were becoming the chief economic feature in the Roman State) were summoned
to send a certain number of recruits from their estates.

Slaves would often be glad to go, for, hard as were the conditions of military service, it
gave them civic freedom, certain honors, a certain pay, and a future for their children. The
poorer freed men would also go at the command of their lord (though only of course a certain
proportion--for the conscription was very light compared with modern systems, and was made
lighter by reënlistment, long service, absence of reserves, and the use of veterans).

During this second stage, while the Army was becoming less and less civic, and more and more
a profession for the destitute and the unfortunate, the unpopularity and the ignorance of military
service among the rest of the population, was increasing. The average citizen grew more and
more divorced from the Army and knew less and less of its conditions. He came to regard it
partly as a necessary police force or defence of his frontiers, partly as a nuisance to him
at home. He also came to regard it as something with which he had nothing to do. It lived a
life separate from himself. It governed (through the power of the Emperor, its chief); it depended
on, and also supported or re-made, the Imperial Court. But it was external, at the close of
the Empire, to general society.

Recruiting was meanwhile becoming difficult, and the habit grew up of offering the hungry tribes
outside the pale of the Empire the advantage of residence within it on condition that they
should serve as Roman soldiers.

The conception of territories within the Empire which were affiliated and allied to it rather
than absorbed by it, was a very ancient one. That conception had lost reality so far as the
old territories it had once affected were concerned; but it paved the way for the parallel
idea of troops affiliated and allied to the Roman Army, part of that army in discipline and
organization, yet possessed of considerable freedom within their own divisions.

Here we have not only a constant and increasing use of barbaric troops drafted into the regular
corps, but also whole bodies which were more and more frequently accepted "en bloc" and, under
their local leaders, as auxiliaries to the Roman forces.

Some such bodies appear to have been settled upon land on the frontiers, to others were given
similar grants at very great distances from the frontiers. Thus we have a small body of German
barbarians settled at Rennes in Brittany. And, again, within the legions (who were all technically
of Roman citizenship and in theory recruited from the full civilization of Rome), the barbarian
who happened to find himself within that civilization tended more than did his non-barbarian
fellow citizen (or fellow slave) to accept military service. He would nearly always be poorer;
he would, unless his experience of civilization was a long one, feel the hardship of military
service less; and in this second phase, while the army was becoming more sedentary (more attached,
that is, to particular garrisons), more permanent, more of an hereditary thing handed on from
father to son, and distinguished by the large element of what we call "married quarters," it
was also becoming more and more an army of men who, whether as auxiliaries or as true Roman
soldiers, were in blood, descent, and to some extent in manners and less in language, barbarians.
There were negroes, there were probably Celts, there were Slavs, Mongols of the Steppes, more
numerous Germans, and so forth.

In the third stage, which is the stage that saw the great convulsion of the fifth century,
the army though not yet wholly barbaric, had already become in its most vital part, barbaric.
It took its orders, of course, wholly from the Roman State, but great groups within it were
only partly even Latin-speaking or Greek-speaking, and were certainly regarded both by themselves
and by their Roman masters as non-Roman in manners and in blood.

It must most clearly be emphasized that not only no such thought as an attack upon the Empire
entered the heads of these soldiers, but that the very idea of it would have been inconceivable
to them. Had you proposed it they would not even have known what you meant. That a particular
section of the army should fight against a particular claimant to the Empire (and therefore
and necessarily in favor of some other claimant) they thought natural enough; but to talk of
an attack upon the Empire itself would have seemed to them like talking of an attack upon bread
and meat, air, water and fire. The Empire was the whole method and meaning of their lives.

At intervals the high and wealthy civilization of the Roman Empire was, of course, subjected
to attempted pillage by small and hungry robber bands without its boundaries, but that had
nothing to do with the barbaric recruitment of the Roman Army save when such bands were caught
and incorporated. The army was always ready at a moment's order to cut such foreign raiders
to pieces--and always did so successfully.

The portion of the Army chosen to repel, cut up, and sell into slavery a marauding band of
Slavs or Germans or Celts, always had Celts or Slavs or Germans present in large numbers among
its own soldiery. But no tie of blood interfered with the business. To consider such a thing
would have been inconceivable to the opponents on either side. The distinction was not between
speech and speech, still less between vague racial customs. It was a distinction between the
Imperial Service on the one side, against the outer, unrecognized, savage on the other.

As the machinery of Government grew weak through old age, and as the recruitment of the Army
from barbarians and the large proportion of auxiliary regular forces began to weaken that basis
of the whole State, the tendency of pillaging bands to break in past the frontiers into the
cultivated lands and the wealth of the cities, grew greater and greater; but it never occurred
to them to attack the Empire as such. All they wanted was permission to enjoy the life which
was led within it, and to abandon the wretched conditions to which they were compelled outside
its boundaries.

Sometimes they were transformed from pillagers to soldiers by an offer extended by the Roman
authorities; more often they snatched a raid when there was for the moment no good garrison
in their neighborhood. Then a Roman force would march against them, and if they were not quick
at getting away would cut them to pieces. But with the progress of the central decline the
attacks of these small bands on the frontiers became more frequent. Frontier towns came to
regard such attacks as a permanent peril and to defend themselves against them. Little groups
of raiders would sometimes traverse great districts from end to end, and whether in the form
of pirates from the sea or of war bands on land, the ceaseless attempts to enjoy or to loot
(but principally to enjoy) the conditions that civilization offered, grew more and more persistent.

It must not be imagined, of course, that civilization had not occasionally to suffer then,
as it had had to suffer at intervals for a thousand years past, the attacks of really large
and organized barbaric armies. [Footnote: For instance, a century and a half before the breakdown
of central Government, the Goths, a barbaric group, largely German, had broken in and ravaged
in a worse fashion than their successors in the fifth century.] Thus in the year 404, driven
by the pressure of an Eastern invasion upon their own forests, a vast barbaric host under one
Radagasius pushed into Italy. The men bearing arms alone were estimated (in a time well used
to soldiery and to such estimates) at 200,000.

But those 200,000 were wiped out. The barbarians were always wiped out when they attempted
to come as conquerors. Stilicho (a typical figure, for he was himself of barbarian descent,
yet in the regular Roman service) cut to pieces one portion of them, the rest surrendered and
were sold off and scattered as slaves.

Immediately afterwards you have a violent quarrel between various soldiers who desire to capture
the Imperial power. The story is fragmentary and somewhat confused: now one usurper is blamed,
and now another, but the fact common to all is that with the direct object of usurping power
a Roman General calls in barbarian bands of pillagers (all sorts of small groups, Franks, Suevians,
Vandals) to cross the Rhine into Gaul, not as barbarian "conquerors," but as allies, to help
in a civil war.

The succeeding generation has left us ample evidence of the results. It presents us with documents
that do not give a picture of a ruined province by any means; only of a province which has
been traversed in certain directions by the march of barbarian robber bands, who afterwards
disappeared, largely in fighting among themselves.

We have, later, the very much more serious business of the Mongol Attila and his Huns, leading
the great outer mass of Germans and Slavs into the Empire on an enormous raid. In the middle
of the fifth century, fifty years after the destruction of Radagasius, these Asiatics, leading
more numerous other barbaric dependents of theirs from the Germanies and the eastern Slavonic
lands, penetrated for two brief moments into Northern Italy and Eastern Gaul. The end of that
business--infinitely graver though it was than the raids that came before it--is just what
one might have expected. The regular and auxiliary disciplined forces of the Empire destroy
the barbarian power near Chalons, and the last and worst of the invasions is wiped out as thoroughly
as had been all the others.

In general, the barbaric eruptions into the Empire failed wholly as soon as Imperial troops
could be brought up to oppose them.

What, then, were the supposed barbaric successes? What was the real nature of the action of
Alaric, for instance, and his sack of Rome; and how, later, do we find local "kings" in the
place of the Roman Governors?

The real nature of the action of men like Alaric is utterly different from the imaginary picture
with which the old picturesque popular history recently provided us. That false history gives
us the impression of a barbarian Chieftain gathering his Clan to a victorious assault on Rome.
Consider the truth upon Alaric and contrast it with this imaginary picture.

Alaric was a young noble of Gothic blood, but from birth a Roman; at eighteen years of age
he was put by the Court in command of a small Roman auxiliary force originally recruited from
the Goths. He was as much a Roman officer, as incapable of thinking of himself in any other
terms than those of the Roman Army, as any other one of his colleagues about the throne. He
had his commission from the Emperor Theodosius, and when Theodosius marched into Gaul against
the usurper Eugenius, he counted Alaric's division as among the most faithful of his Army.

It so happened, moreover, that those few original auxiliaries--mainly Goths by race--were nearly
all destroyed in the campaign. Alaric survived. The remnant of his division was recruited,
we know not how, but probably from all kinds of sources, to its old strength. It was still
called "Gothic," though now of the most mixed origin, and it was still commanded by himself
in his character of a Roman General.

Alaric, after this service to the Emperor, was rewarded by further military dignities in the
Roman military hierarchy. He was ambitious of military titles and of important command, as
are all soldiers.

Though still under twenty years of age and only a commander of auxiliaries, he asks for the
title of Magister Militum, with the dignity which accompanied that highest of military posts.
The Emperor refuses it. One of the Ministers thereupon begins to plot with Alaric, and suggests
to him that he might gather other auxiliary troops under his command, and make things uncomfortable
for his superiors. Alaric rebels, marches through the Balkan Peninsula into Thessaly and Greece,
and down into the Peloponesus; the regulars march against him (according to some accounts)
and beat him back into Albania.

There ends his first adventure. It is exactly like that of a hundred other Roman generals in
the past, and so are his further adventures. He remains in Albania at the head of his forces,
and makes peace with the Government--still enjoying a regular commission from the Emperor.

He next tries a new adventure to serve his ambition in Italy, but his army is broken to pieces
at Pollentia by the armies in Italy--under a general, by the way, as barbaric in mere descent
as was Alaric, but, like Alaric, wholly Roman in training and ideas.

The whole thing is a civil war between various branches of the Roman service, and is motived,
like all the Roman civil wars for hundreds of years before, by the ambitions of generals.

Alaric does not lose his commission even after his second adventure; he begins to intrigue
between the Western and Eastern heads of the Roman Empire. The great invasion under Radagasius
interrupts this civil war. That invasion was for Alaric, of course, as for any other Roman
officer, an invasion of barbaric enemies. That these enemies should be called by this or that
barbaric name is quite indifferent to him. They come from outside the Empire and are therefore,
in his eyes, cattle. He helps to destroy them, and destroyed they are--promptly and thoroughly.

When the brief invasion was over, Alaric had the opportunity to renew the civil wars within
the Empire, and asked for certain arrears of pay that were due to him. Stilicho, the great
rival general (himself, by the way, a Vandal in descent), admitted Alaric's right to arrears
of pay, but just at that moment there occurred an obscure palace intrigue which was based,
like all the real movements of the time, on differences of religion, not of race. Stilicho,
suspected of attempting to restore paganism, is killed. In the general confusion certain of
the families of the auxiliaries garrisoned in Italy are massacred by the non-military population.
As Alaric is a general in partial rebellion against the Imperial authority, these auxiliaries
join him.

The total number of Alaric's men was at this moment very small; they were perhaps 30,000. There
was no trace of nationality about them. They were simply a body of discontented soldiers; they
had not come from across the frontier; they were not invaders; they were part of the long established
and regular garrisons of the Empire; and, for that matter, many garrisons and troops of equally
barbaric origin, sided with the regular authorities in the quarrel. Alaric marches on Rome
with this disaffected Roman Army, claiming that he has been defrauded of his due in salary,
and leaning upon the popularity of the dead Stilicho, whose murder he says he will avenge.
His thirty thousand claim the barbarian slaves within the city, and certain sums of money which
had been, the pretext and motive of his rebellion.

As a result of this action the Emperor promises Alaric his regular salary as a general, and
a district which he may not only command, but plant with his few followers. Even in the height
of his success, Alaric again demands the thing which was nearest his heart, the supreme and
entirely Roman title of Magister Militum, the highest post in the hierarchy of military advancement.
But the Emperor again refuses to give that. Alaric again marches on Rome, a Roman officer followed
by a rebellious Roman Army. He forces the Senate to make Attalus nominal Emperor of the West,
and Attalus to give him the desired title, his very craving for which is most significant of
the Roman character of the whole business. Alaric then quarrels with his puppet, deprives him
of the insignia of the Empire, and sends them to Honorius; quarrels again with Honorius, reënters
Rome and pillages it, marches to Southern Italy, dies, and his small army is dismembered.

There is the story of Alaric as it appears from documents and as it was in reality. There is
the truth underlying the false picture with which most educated men were recently provided
by the anti-Roman bias of recent history.

Certainly the story of Alaric's discontent with his salary and the terms of his commission,
his raiding marches, his plunder of the capital, shows how vastly different was the beginning
of the fifth century from the society of three hundred years before. It is symptomatic of the
change, and it could only have been possible at a moment when central government was at last
breaking down. But it is utterly different in motive and in social character from the vague
customary conception of a vast barbarian "invasion," led by a German "war lord" pouring over
the Alps and taking Roman society and its capital by storm. It has no relation to such a picture.

The plays were whole rake; the advocate.
 A Rex was not then, in Spain, or in Gaul, a King in our modern sense of the
word: he was only the military head of a particular armed force. He was originally the commander
(hereditary or chosen or nominated by the Emperor) of an auxiliary force serving as part of
the Roman Army. Later, when these troops--originally recruited perhaps from some one barbaric
district--changed by slow degrees into a body half police, half noble, their original name
would extend to the whole local army. The "Rex" of, say, Batavian auxiliaries, the commander
of the Batavian Corps, would probably be a man of Batavian blood, with hereditary position
and would be called "Rex Bataviorum." Afterwards, when the recruiting was mixed, he still kept
that title and later still, when the Batavii, as such, had disappeared, his fixed title would
remain.

There was no similarity possible between the word Rex and the word Imperator, any more than
there is between the words "Miners' Union" or "Trade Conference" and the word "England." There
was, of course, no sort of equality. A Roman General in the early part of the process planning
a battle would think of a Rex as we think of a Divisionary General. He might say: "I shall
put my regulars here in the centre. My auxiliaries (Huns or Goths or Franks or what not) I
shall put here. Send for their 'Rex' and I will give him his orders."

A Rex in this sense was a subject and often an unimportant subject of the Imperator or Emperor:
the Imperator being, as we remember, the Commander-in-Chief of the Roman Army, upon which institution
the Roman State or Empire or civilization had depended for so many centuries.

When the Roman Army began to add to itself auxiliary troops (drilled of course after the Roman
fashion and forming one body with the Roman forces, but contracted for "in bulk," as it were)
the chieftains of these barbaric and often small bodies were called in the official language,
Reges. Thus Alaric, a Roman officer and nothing more, was the Rex of his officially appointed
auxiliary force; and since the nucleus of that force had once been a small body of Goths, and
since Alaric held his position as an officer of that auxiliary force because he had once been,
by inheritance, a chieftain of the Goths, the word Rex was attached to his Imperial Commission
in the Roman Army, and there was added to it the name of that particular barbaric tribe with
which his command had originally been connected. He was Rex of the Roman auxiliary troops called
"Goths." The "Rex" in Spain was "Rex Gotorum," not "Rex Hispaniæ"--that was altogether a later
idea. The Rex in Northern France was not Rex Galliæ, he was "Rex Francorum." In each case he
was the Rex of the particular auxiliary troop from which his ancestors--sometimes generations
before--had originally drawn their Imperial Commission and their right to be officers in the
Roman Army.

Thus you will have the Rex Francorum, or King of the Franks, so styled in the Palatium at Paris,
as late as, say, 700 A.D. Not because any body of "Franks" still survived as a separate corps--they
had been but a couple of regiments or so [Footnote: We have documentary record. The greater
part of the Frankish auxiliaries under Clovis were baptized with their General. They came to
4,000 men.] two hundred years before and had long disappeared--but because the original title
had derived from a Roman auxiliary force of Franks.

In other words, the old Roman local legislative and taxing power, the reality of which lay
in the old surviving Roman machinery of a hierarchy of officials with their titles, writs,
etc., was vested in the hands of a man called "Rex," that is, "Commander" of such and such
an auxiliary force; Commander of the Franks, for instance, or Commander of the Goths. He still
commanded in the year 550 a not very large military force on which local government depended,
and in this little army the barbarians were still probably predominant because, as we have
seen, towards the end of the Empire the stuff of the army had become barbaric and the armed
force was mainly of barbaric recruitment. But that small military force was also, and as certainly,
very mixed indeed; many a slave or broken Roman freedman would enlist, for it had privileges
and advantages of great value; [Footnote: Hence the "leges" or codes specially regulating the
status of these Roman troops and called in documents the laws of the "Goths" or "Burgundians,"
as the case may he. There is a trace of old barbaric customs in some of these, sometimes of
an exclusive rule of marriage; but the mass of them are obviously Roman privileges.] no one
cared in the least whether the members of the armed forces which sustained society were Roman,
Gallic, Italian or German in racial origin. They were of all races and origins. Very shortly
after--by, say, 600, at latest--the Army had become a universal rough levy of all sorts and
kinds, and the restriction of race was forgotten save in a few customs still clinging by hereditary
right to certain families and called their "laws."

Again, there was no conception of rebellion against the Empire in the mind of a Rex. All these
Reges without exception held their military office and power originally by a commission from
the Empire. All of them derived their authority from men who had been regularly established
as Imperial functionaries. When the central power of the Emperor had, as a fact, broken down,
the Rex as a fact administered the whole machinery without control.

But no Rex ever tried to emancipate himself from the Empire or warred for independence against
the Emperor. The Rex, the local man, undertook all government simply because the old Government
above him, the central Government, had failed. No Rex ever called himself a local Imperator
or dreamed of calling himself so; and that is the most significant thing in all the transition
between the full civilization of the old Empire and the Dark Ages. The original Roman armies
invading Gaul, Spain, the western Germanies and Hungary, fought to conquer, to absorb, to be
masters of and makers of the land they seized. No local governor of the later transition, no
Rex of Vandal, Goth, Hun, Frank or Berber or Moor troop ever dreamt of such a thing. He might
fight another local Rex to get part of his taxing-power or his treasure. He might take part
in the great religious quarrels (as in Africa) and act tyrannically against a dissident majority,
but to fight against the Empire as such or to attempt conquest and rule over a "subject population"
would have meant nothing to him; in theory the Empire was still under one control.

There, then, you have the picture of what held the levers of the machine of government during
the period of its degradation and transformation, which followed the breakdown of central authority.
Clovis, in the north of France, the Burgundian chieftain at Arles, Theodoric in Italy, Athanagild
later at Toledo in Spain, were all of them men who had stepped into the shoes of an unbroken
local Roman administration, who worked entirely by it, and whose machinery of administration
wherever they went was called by the Roman and official name of Palatium.

Their families were originally of barbaric stock: they had for their small armed forces a military
institution descended and derived from the Roman auxiliary forces; often, especially in the
early years of their power, they spoke a mixed and partly barbaric tongue [Footnote: The barbaric
dialects outside the Empire were already largely latinized through commerce with the Empire
and by its influence, and, of course, what we call "Teutonic Languages" are in reality half
Roman, long before we get our first full documents in the eighth and ninth centuries.] more
easily than pure Latin; but every one of them was a soldier of the declining Empire and regarded
himself as a part of it, not as even conceivably an enemy of it.

When we appreciate this we can understand how insignificant were those changes of frontier
which make so great a show in historical atlases.

The Rex of such and such an auxiliary force dies and divides his "kingdom" between two sons.
What does that mean? Not that a nation with its customs and its whole form of administration
was suddenly divided into two, still less that there has been what today we call "annexation"
or "partition" of states. It simply means that the honor and advantage of administration are
divided between the two heirs, who take, the one the one area, the other the other, over which
to gather taxes and to receive personal profit. It must always be remembered that the personal
privilege so received was very small in comparison with the total revenue to be administrated,
and that the vast mass of public work as carried on by the judiciary, the officers of the Treasury
and so forth, continued to be quite impersonal and fundamentally imperial. This governmental
world of clerks and civil servants lived its own life and was only in theory dependent upon
the Rex, and the Rex was no more than the successor of the chief local Roman official. [Footnote:
Our popular historical atlases render a very bad service to education by their way of coloring
these districts as though they were separate modern nations. The real division right up to
full tide of feudalism was Christian and Pagan, and, within the former, Eastern and Western:
Greek and Latin.]

The Rex, by the way, called himself always by some definite inferior Roman title, such as Vir
Illuster, as an Englishman today might be called "Sir Charles So and So" or "Lord So and So,"
never anything more; and often (as in the case of Clovis), he not only accepted directly from
the Roman Emperor a particular office, but observed the old popular Roman customs such as,
largesse and procession, upon his induction into that office.

Now why did not this man, this Rex, in Italy or Gaul or Spain, simply remain in the position
of local Roman Governor? One would imagine, if one did not know more about that society, that
he should have done this.

The small auxiliary forces of which he had been chieftain rapidly merged into the body of the
Empire, as had the infinitely larger mass of slaves and colonists, equally barbarian in origin,
for century after century before that time. The body of civilization was one, and we wonder,
at first, why its moral unity did not continue to be represented by a central Monarch. Though
the civilization continued to decline, its forms should, one would think, have remained unchanged
and the theoretic attachment of each of these subordinates to the Roman Emperor at Constantinople
should have endured indefinitely. As a fact, the memory of the old central authority of the
Emperor was gradually forgotten; the Rex and his local government as he got weaker also got
more isolated. He came to coining his own money, to treating directly as a completely independent
ruler. At last the idea of "kings" and "kingdoms" took shape in men's minds. Why?

The reason that the nature of authority very slowly changed, that the last links with the Roman
Empire of the East--that is, with the supreme head at Constantinople--gradually dissolved in
the West, and that the modern nation arose around these local governments of the Reges, is
to be found in that novel feature, the standing Council of great men around the Rex, with whom
everything is done.

This standing Council expresses three forces, which between them, were transforming society.
Those three forces were: first, certain vague underlying national feelings, older than the
Empire, Gallic, Brittanic, Iberian; secondly, the economic force of the great Roman landowners,
and, lastly, the living organization of the Catholic Church.

On the economic, or material, side of society, the great landowners were the reality of that time.

We have no statistics to go upon. But the facts of the time and the nature of its institutions
are quite as cogent as detailed statistics. In Spain, in Gaul, in Italy, as in Africa, economic
power had concentrated into the hands of exceedingly few men. A few hundred men and women,
a few dozen corporations (especially the episcopal sees) had come to own most of the land on
which these millions and millions lived; and, with the land, most of the implements and of
the slaves.

As to the descent of these great landowners none asked or cared. By the middle of the sixth
century only a minority perhaps were still of unmixed blood, but quite certainly none were
purely barbaric. Lands waste or confiscated through the decline of population or the effect
of the interminable wars and the plagues, lay in the power of the Palatium, which granted them
out again (strictly under the eye of the Council of Great Men) to new holders.

The few who had come in as original followers and dependents of the "chieftain" of the auxiliary
forces benefited largely; but the thing that really concerns the story of civilization is not
the origin of these immensely rich owners (which was mixed), nor their sense of race (which
simply did not exist), but the fact that they were so few. It explains both what happened and
what was to happen.

That a handful of men, for they were no more than a handful, should thus be in control of the
economic destinies of mankind--the result of centuries of Roman development in that direction--is
the key to all the material decline of the Empire. It should furnish us, if we were wise, with
an object lesson for our own politics today.

The decline of the Imperial power was mainly due to this extraordinary concentration of economic
power in the hands of a few. It was these few great Roman landowners who in every local government
endowed each of the new administrators, each new Rex, with a tradition of imperial power, not
a little of the dread that went with the old imperial name, and the armed force which it connoted:
everywhere the Rex had to reckon with the strength of highly concentrated wealth. This was
the first element in that standing "Council of Great Men" which was the mark of the time in
every locality and wore down the old official, imperial, absolute, local power.

There was, however, as I have said, another and a much more important element in the Council
of Great Men, besides the chief landowners; it consisted of the Hierarchy of the Catholic Church.

Every Roman city of that time had a principal personage in it, who knew its life better than
anybody else, who had, more than anyone else, power over its morals and ideas, and who in many
cases actually administered its affairs. That person was the Bishop.

Throughout Western Europe at that moment men's interest and preoccupation was not race nor
even material prosperity, but religion. The great duel between Paganism and the Catholic Church
was now decided, after two hard centuries of struggle, in favor of the latter. The Catholic
Church, from a small but definite and very tenacious organization within the Empire, and on
the whole antagonistic to it, had risen, first, to be the only group of men which knew its
own mind (200 A.D.); next to be the official religion (300 A.D.); finally to be the cohesive
political principle of the great majority of human beings (400 A.D.).

The modern man can distinctly appreciate the phenomenon, if for "creed" he will read "capital,"
and for the "Faith," "industrial civilization." For just as today men principally care for
great fortunes, and in pursuit of them go indifferently from country to country, and sink,
as unimportant compared with such an object, the other businesses of our time, so the men of
the fifth and sixth centuries were intent upon the unity and exactitude of religion. That the
religion to which the Empire was now converted, the religion of the Catholic Church, should
triumph, was their one preoccupation. For this they exiled themselves; for this they would
and did run great risks; as minor to this they sank all other things.

The Catholic hierarchy with its enormous power at that moment, civil and economic as well as
religious, was not the creator of such a spirit, it was only its leader. And in connection
with that intense preoccupation of men's minds, two factors already appear in the fourth century
and are increasingly active through the fifth and sixth. The first is the desire that the living
Church should be as free as possible; hence the Catholic Church and its ministers everywhere
welcome the growth of local as against centralized power. They do so unconsciously but none
the less strongly. The second factor is Arianism: to which I now return.

Arianism, which both in its material success and in the length of its duration, as well as
in its concept of religion, and the character of its demise, is singularly parallel to the
Protestant movement of recent centuries, had sprung up as the official and fashionable Court
heresy opposed to the orthodoxy of the Church.

The Emperor's Court did indeed at last--after many variations--abandon it, but a tradition
survived till long after (and in many places) that Arianism stood for the "wealthy" and "respectable"
in life.

Moreover, of those barbarians who had taken service as auxiliaries in the Roman armies, the
greater part (the "Goths," for instance, as the generic term went, though that term had no
longer any national meaning) had received their baptism into civilized Europe from Arian sources,
and this in the old time of the fourth century when Arianism was "the thing." Just as we see
in eighteenth century Ireland settlers and immigrants accepting Protestantism as "gentlemanly"
or "progressive" (some there are so provincial as still to feel thus), so the Rex in Spain
and the Rex in Italy had a family tradition; they, and the descendants of their original companions,
were of what had been the "court" and "upper class" way of thinking. They were "Arians" and
proud of it. The number of these powerful heretics in the little local courts was small, but
their irritant effect was great.

It was the one great quarrel and problem of the time.

No one troubled about race, but everybody was at white heat upon the final form of the Church.

The populace felt it in their bones that if Arianism conquered, Europe was lost: for Arianism
lacked vision. It was essentially a hesitation to accept the Incarnation and therefore it would
have bred sooner or later a denial of the Sacrament, and at length it would have relapsed,
as Protestantism has, into nothingness. Such a decline of imagination and of will would have
been fatal to a society materially decadent. Had Arianism triumphed, the aged Society of Europe
would have perished.

Now it so happened that of these local administrators or governors who were rapidly becoming
independent, and who were surrounded by a powerful court, one only was not Arian.

That one was the Rex Francorum or chieftain of the little barbaric auxiliary force of "Franks"
which had been drawn into the Roman system from Belgium and the banks of the lower Rhine. This
body at the time when the transformation took place between the old Imperial system and the
beginnings of the nations, had its headquarters in the Roman town of Tournai.

A lad whose Roman name was Clodovicus, and whom his parents probably called by some such sound
as Clodovig (they had no written language), succeeded his father, a Roman officer, [Footnote:
He was presumably head of auxiliaries. His tomb has been found. It is wholly Roman.] in the
generalship of this small body of troops at the end of the fifth century. Unlike the other
auxiliary generals he was pagan. When with other forces of the Roman Army, he had repelled
one of the last of the barbaric invaders close to the frontier at the Roman town of Tolbiacum,
and succeeded to the power of local administration in Northern Gaul, he could not but assimilate
himself with the civilization wherein he was mixed, and he and most of his small command were
baptized. He had already married a Christian wife, the daughter of the Burgundian Rex; but
in any case such a conclusion was inevitable.

The important historical point is not that he was baptized; for an auxiliary general to be
baptized was, by the end of the fifth century, as much a matter of course as for an Oriental
trader from Bombay, who has become an English Lord or Baronet in London in our time, to wear
trousers and a coat. The important thing is that he was received and baptized by Catholics
and not by Arians--in the midst of that enormous struggle.

Clodovicus--known in history as Clovis--came from a remote corner of civilization. His men
were untouched by the worldly attraction of Arianism; they had no tradition that it was "the
thing" or "smart" to adopt the old court heresy which was offensive to the poorer mass of Europeans.
When, therefore, this Rex Francorum was settled in Paris--about the year 500--and was beginning
to administer local government in Northern Gaul, the weight of his influence was thrown with
the popular feeling and against the Arian Reges in Italy and Spain.

The new armed forces of the Rex Francorum, a general levy continuing the old Roman tradition,
settling things once and for all by battle carried orthodox Catholic administration all over
Gaul. They turned the Arian Rex out of Toulouse, they occupied the valley of the Rhone. For
a moment it seemed as though they would support the Catholic populace against the Arian officials
in Italy itself.

At any rate, their championship of popular and general religion against the irritant, small,
administrative Arian bodies in the Palatium of this region and of that, was a very strong lever
which the people and the Bishops at their head could not but use in favor of the Rex Francorum's
independent power. It was, therefore, indirectly, a very strong lever for breaking up the now
(500-600) decayed and almost forgotten administrative unity of the Roman world.

Under such forces--the power of the Bishop in each town and district, the growing independence
of the few and immensely rich great landowners, the occupation of the Palatium and its official
machinery by the chieftains of the old auxiliary forces--Western Europe, slowly, very slowly,
shifted its political base.

For three generations the mints continued to strike money under the effigy of the Emperor.
The new local rulers never took, or dreamed of taking, the Imperial title; the roads were still
kept up, the Roman tradition in the arts of life, though coarsened, was never lost. In cooking,
dress, architecture, law, and the rest, all the world was Roman. But the visible unity of the
Western or Latin Empire not only lacked a civilian and military centre, but gradually lost
all need for such a centre.

Towards the year 600, though our civilization was still one, as it had always been, from the
British Channel to the Desert of Sahara, and even (through missionaries) extended its effect
a few miles eastward of the old Roman frontier beyond the Rhine, men no longer thought of that
civilization as a highly defined area within which they could always find the civilian authority
of one organ. Men no longer spoke of our Europe as the Respublica or "common weal." It was
already beginning to become a mass of small and often overlapping divisions. The things that
are older than, and lie beneath, all exact political institutions, the popular legends, the
popular feelings for locality and countrysides, were rising everywhere; the great landowners
were appearing as semi-independent rulers, each on his own estates (though the many estates
of one man were often widely separated).

The daily speech of men was already becoming divided into an infinity of jargons.

Some of these dialects were of Latin origin, some as in the Germanies and Scandinavia, mixed
original Teutonic and Latin; some, as in Brittany, were Celtic; some, as in the eastern Pyrenees,
Basque; in North Africa, we may presume, the indigenous tongue of the Berbers resumed its sway;
Punic also may have survived in certain towns and villages there. [Footnote: We have evidence
that it survived in the fifth century.] But men paid no attention to the origin of such diversities.
The common unity that survived was expressed in the fixed Latin tongue, the tongue of the Church;
and the Church, now everywhere supreme in the decay of Arianism and of paganism alike, was
the principle of life throughout all this great area of the West.

So it was in Gaul, and with the little belt annexed to Gaul that had risen in the Germanies
to the east of the Rhine; so with nearly all Italy and Dalmatia, and what today we call Switzerland
and a part of what today we call Bavaria and Baden; so with what today we call Spain and Portugal;
and so (after local adventures of a parallel sort, followed by a reconquest against Arians
by Imperial officers and armies) with North Africa and with a strip of Andalusia.

But one part of one province did suffer a limited and local--but sharp--change: on one frontier
belt, narrow but long, came something much more nearly resembling a true barbaric success,
and the results thereof, than anything which the Continent could show. There was here a real
breach of continuity with Roman things.

This exceptional strip was the eastern coast belt of the province of Britain; and we have next
to ask: "What happened in Britain when the rest of the Empire was being transformed, after
the breakdown of central Imperial power?" Unless we can answer that question we shall fail
to possess a true picture of the continuity of Europe and of the early perils in spite of which
that continuity has survived.

I turn, therefore, next to answer the question: "What happened in Britain?"

V

WHAT HAPPENED IN BRITAIN?

I have now carried this study through four sections. My object in writing it is to show that
the Roman Empire never perished but was only transformed; that the Catholic Church, which,
in its maturity, it accepted, caused it to survive and was, in that origin of Europe, and has
since remained, the soul of one Western civilization.

In the first chapter I sketched the nature of the Roman Empire, in the second the nature of
the Church within the Roman Empire before that civilization in its maturity accepted the Faith.
In the third I attempted to lay before the reader that transformation and material decline
(it was also a survival), which has erroneously been called "the fall" of the Roman Empire.
In the fourth I presented a picture of what society must have seemed to an onlooker just after
the crisis of that transformation and at the entry into what are called the Dark Ages: the
beginnings of the modern European nations which have superficially differentiated from the
old unity of Rome.

I could wish that space had permitted me to describe a hundred other contemporary things which
would enable the reader to seize both the magnitude and the significance of the great change
from Pagan to Christian times. I should in particular have dwelt upon the transformation of
the European mind with its increasing gravity, its ripening contempt for material things, and
its resolution upon the ultimate fate of the human soul, which it now had firmly concluded
to be personally immortal and subject to a conscious destiny.

This doctrine of personal immortality is the prime mark of the European and stamps his leadership
upon the world.

Its original seat--long before history begins--lay perhaps in Ireland, later in Britain, certainly
reduced to definition either in Britain or in Gaul. It increasingly influenced Greece and even
had some influence upon the Jews before the Romans subdued them. But it remained an opinion,
an idea looming in the dark, till it was seen strong and concrete in the full light of the
Catholic Church. Oddly enough, Mahomet, who in most things reacted towards weakness of flesh
and spirit, adopted this Western doctrine fully; it provided his system with its vigor. Everywhere
is that doctrine of immortality the note of superior intelligence and will, especially in its
contrast with the thin pantheism and negations of Asia. Everywhere does it accompany health
and decision.

Its only worthy counterpart (equally European but rare, uprooted and private) is the bold affirmation
of complete and final death.

The transformation of the Roman Empire, then, in the fourth century and the fifth was eventually
its preservation, in peril of full decay, by its acceptation of the Faith.

To this I might have attached the continued carelessness for the plastic arts and for much
in letters, the continued growth in holiness, and all that "salting," as it were, which preserved
civilization and kept it whole until, after the long sequestration of the Dark Ages, it should
discover an opportunity for revival.

My space has not permitted me to describe these things, I must turn at once to the last, and
what is for my readers the chief, of the historical problems presented by the beginning of
the Dark Ages. That problem is the fate of Britain.

The importance of deciding what happened in Britain when the central government of Rome failed,
does not lie in the fact that an historical conclusion one way or the other can affect the
truth. European civilization is still one whether men see that unity or no. The Catholic Church
is still the soul of it, whether men know it or do not know it. But the problem presented by
the fate of Britain at that critical moment when the provinces of the Roman Empire became independent
of any common secular control, has this practical importance: that those who read it wrongly
and who provide their readers with a false solution (as the Protestant German school and their
copiers in English, Freeman, Green and the rest have done) those who talk of "the coming of
the English," "the Anglo-Saxon conquest," and the rest, not only furnish arguments against
the proper unity of our European story but also produce a warped attitude in the mind. Such
men as are deceived by false accounts of the fate of Britain at the entry into the Dark Ages,
take for granted many other things historically untrue. Their presumptions confuse or conceal
much else that is historical truth: for instance, the character of the Normans; and even contemporary
and momentous truth before our eyes today: for instance, the gulf between Englishmen and Prussians.
They not only render an Englishman ignorant of his own nation and therefore of himself, they
also render all men ignorant of Europe: for a knowledge of Britain in the period 500-700 as
in the period 1530-1630 is the test of European history: and if you are wrong on these two
points you are wrong on the whole.

A man who desires to make out that the Empire--that is European civilization--was "conquered"
by barbarians cannot today, in the light of modern research, prove his case in Gaul, in Italy,
in Spain, or in the valley of the Rhine. The old German thesis of a barbaric "conquest" upon
the Continent, possible when modern history was a child, has necessarily been abandoned in
its maturity. But that thesis still tries to make out a plausible case when it speaks of Britain,
because so much of the record here is lost that there is more room for make-believe; and having
made it out, the tale of a German and barbaric England, his false result will powerfully affect
modern and immediate conclusions upon our common civilization, upon our institutions, and their
nature, and in particular upon the Faith and its authority in Europe.

For if Britain be something other than England: if what we now know is not original to this
Island, but is of the Northern German barbarism in race and tradition, if, in the breakdown
of the Roman Empire, Britain was the one exceptional province which really did become a separate
barbaric thing, cut off at the roots from the rest of civilization, then those who desire to
believe that the institutions of Europe are of no universal effect, that the ancient laws of
the Empire as on property and marriage--were local, and in particular that the Reformation
was the revolt of a race--and of a strong and conquering race--against the decaying traditions
of Rome, have something to stand on. It does not indeed help them to prove that our civilization
is bad or that the Faith is untrue, but it permits them to despair of, or to despise, the unity
of Europe, and to regard the present Protestant world as something which is destined to supplant
that unity.

Such a point of view is wrong historically as it is wrong in morals. It will find no basis
of military success in the future any more than it has in the past. [Footnote: I wrote and
first printed these words in 1912. I leave them standing with greater force in 1920.] It must
ultimately break down if ever it should attempt to put into practice its theory of superiority
in barbaric things. But meanwhile as a self-confident theory it can do harm indefinitely great
by warping a great section of the European mind; bidding it refer its character to imaginary
barbaric origins, so divorcing it from the majestic spirit of Western Civilization. The North
German "Teutonic" school of false popular history can create its own imaginary past, and lend
to such a figment the authority of antiquity and of lineage.

To show how false this modern school of history has been, but also what opportunities it had
for advancing its thesis, is the object of what follows.

Britain, be it remembered, is today the only part of the Roman world in which a conscious antagonism
to the ancient and permanent civilization of Europe exists. The Northern Germanies and Scandinavia,
which have had, since the Reformation, a religious agreement with all that is still politically
powerful in Britain, lay outside the old civilization. They would not have survived the schism
of the sixteenth century had Britain resisted that schism. When we come to deal with the story
of the Reformation in Britain, we shall see how the strong popular resistance to the Reformation
nearly overcame that small wealthy class which used the religious excitement of an active minority
as an engine to obtain material advantage for themselves. But as a fact in Britain the popular
resistance to the Reformation failed. A violent and almost universal persecution directed,
in the main by the wealthier classes, against the religion of the English populace and the
wealth which endowed it just happened to succeed. In little more than a hundred years the newly
enriched had won the battle. By the year 1600 the Faith of the British masses had been stamped
out from the Highlands to the Channel.

It is our business to understand that this phenomenon, the moral severance of Britain from
Europe, was a phenomenon of the sixteenth century and not of the fifth, and that Britain was
in no way predestined by race or tradition to so lamentable and tragic a loss.

Let us state the factors in the problem.

The main factor in the problem is that the history of Great Britain from just before the middle
of the fifth century (say the years 420 to 445) until the landing of St. Augustine in 597 is
a blank.

It is of the first importance to the student of the general history in Europe to seize this
point. It is true of no other Roman western province, and the truth of it has permitted a vast
amount of empty assertion, most of it recent, and nearly all of it as demonstrably (as it is
obviously) created by a religious bias. When there is no proof or record men can imagine almost
anything, and the anti-Catholic historians have stretched imagination to the last possible
limit in filling this blank with whatever could tell against the continuity of civilization.

It is the business of those who love historic truth to get rid of such speculations as of so
much rubbish, and to restore to the general reader the few certain facts upon which he can
solidly build.

Let me repeat that, had Britain remained true to the unity of Europe in that unfortunate oppression
of the sixteenth century which ended in the loss of the Faith, had the populace stood firm
or been able to succeed in the field and under arms, or to strike terror into their oppressors
by an efficient revolt, in other words had the England of the Tudors remained Catholic, the
solution of this ancient problem of the early Dark Ages would present no immediate advantage,
nor perhaps would the problem interest men even academically. England would now be one with
Europe as she had been for a thousand years before the uprooting of the Reformation. But, as
things are, the need for correction is immediate and its success of momentous effect. No true
historian, even though he should most bitterly resent the effect of Catholicism upon the European
mind, can do other than combat what was, until quite recently, the prevalent teaching with
regard to the fate of Britain when the central government of the Empire decayed.

I will first deal with the evidence--such as it is--which has come down to us upon the fate
of Britain during the fifth and sixth centuries, and next consider the conclusions to which
such evidence should lead us.

THE EVIDENCE

When we have to deal with a gap in history (and though none in Western European history is
so strangely empty as this, yet there are very many minor ones which enable us to reason from
their analogy), two methods of bridging the gap are present to the historian. The first is
research into such rare contemporary records as may illustrate the period: the second is the
parallel of what has happened elsewhere in the same case, or better still (when that is possible)
the example of what was proceeding in similar places and under similar circumstances at the
same time. And there is a third thing: both of these methods must be submitted to the criterion
of common sense more thoroughly and more absolutely than the evidence of fuller periods. For
when you have full evidence, even of a thing extraordinary, you must admit its truth. But when
there is little evidence guess-work comes in, and common sense is the correction of guess-work.

If, for instance, I learn, as I can learn from contemporary records and from the witness of
men still living, that at the battle of Gettysburg infantry advanced so boldly as to bayonet
gunners at their guns, I must believe it although the event is astonishing.

If I learn, as I can learn, that a highly civilized and informed government like that of the
French in 1870, entering into a war against a great rival, had only the old muzzle-loading
cannon when their enemies were already equipped with modern breech-loading pieces, I must accept
it on overwhelming evidence, in spite of my astonishment.

When even the miraculous appears in a record--if its human evidence is multiple, converging
and exact--I must accept it or deny the value of human evidence.

But when I am dealing with a period or an event for which evidence is lacking or deficient,
then obviously it is a sound criterion of criticism to accept the probable and not to presuppose
the improbable. Common sense and general experience are nowhere more necessary than in their
application, whether in a court of law or in the study of history, to those problems whose
difficulty consists in the absence of direct proof. [Footnote: For instance, there is no contemporary
account mentioning London during the last half of the fifth and nearly all the sixth century.
Green, Freeman, Stubbs, say (making it up as they go along) that London ceased to exist: disappeared!
Then (they assert) after a long period of complete abandonment it was laboriously cleared by
a totally new race of men and as laboriously rebuilt on exactly the same site. The thing is
not physically impossible, but it is so exceedingly improbable that common sense laughs at it.]

Remembering all this, let us first set down what is positively known from record with regard
to the fate of Britain in the hundred and fifty years of "the gap."

We begin by noting that there were many groups of German soldiery in Britain before the Pirate
raids and that the southwest was--whether on account of earlier pirate raids or on account
of Saxon settlers the descendants of Roman soldiers--called "the Saxon shore" long before the
Imperial system broke down.

Next we turn to documents.

There is exactly one contemporary document professing to tell us anything at all of what happened
within this considerable period, exactly one document set down by a witness; and that document
is almost valueless for our purpose.

It bears the title, De Excidio Brittaniæ Liber Querulus. St. Gildas, a monk, was its author.
The exact date of its compilation is a matter of dispute--necessarily so, for the whole of
that time is quite dark. But it is certainly not earlier than 545. So it was written one hundred
years after the beginning of that darkness which covers British history for one hundred and
fifty years; most of the Roman regulars had been called away for a continental campaign in
410. They had often so left the island before. But this time the troops sent out on expedition
did not return. Britain was visited in 429 and 447 by men who left records. It was not till
597 that St. Augustine landed. St. Augustine landed only fifty years at the most after Gildas
wrote his Liber Querulus, whereas the snapping of the links between the Continent and southeastern
Britain had taken place at least a hundred years before.

Well, it so happens that this book is, as I have called it, almost valueless for history. It
is good in morals; its author complains, as all just men must do in all times, of the wickedness
of powerful men, and of the vices of princes. It is a homily. The motive of it is not history,
but the reformation of morals. In all matters extending to more than a lifetime before that
of the writer, in all matters, that is, on which he could not obtain personal evidence, he
is hopelessly at sea. He is valuable only as giving us the general impression of military and
social struggles as they struck a monk who desired to make them the text of a sermon.

He vaguely talks of Saxon auxiliaries from the North Sea being hired (in the traditional Roman
manner) by some Prince in Roman Britain to fight savages who had come out of the Highlands
of Scotland and were raiding. He says this use of new auxiliaries began after the Third Consulship
of Aëtius (whom he calls "Agitius"), that is, after 446 A.D. He talks still more vaguely of
the election of local kings to defend the island from the excesses of these auxiliaries. He
is quite as much concerned with the incursions of robber bands of Irish and Scotch into the
civilized Roman province as he is with the few Saxon auxiliaries who were thus called in to
supplement the arms of the Roman provincials.

He speaks only of a handful of these auxiliaries, three boatloads; but he is so vague and ill-instructed
on the whole of this early period--a hundred years before his time--that one must treat his
account of the transaction as half legendary. He tells us that "more numerous companies followed,"
and we know what that means in the case of the Roman auxiliaries throughout the Empire, a few
thousand armed men.

He goes on to say that these auxiliaries mutinying for pay (another parallel to what we should
expect from the history of all the previous hundred years all over Europe), threatened to plunder
the civil population. Then comes one sentence of rhetoric saying how they ravaged the countrysides
"in punishment for our previous sins," until the "flames" of the tumult actually "licked the
Western Ocean." It is all (and there is much more) just like what we read in the rhetoric of
the lettered men on the Continent who watched the comparatively small but destructive bands
of barbarian auxiliaries in revolt, with their accompaniment of escaped slaves and local ne'er-do-wells,
crossing Gaul and pillaging. If we had no record of the continental troubles but that of some
one religious man using a local disaster as the opportunity for a moral discourse, historians
could have talked of Gaul exactly as they talk of Britain on the sole authority of St. Gildas.
All the exaggeration to which we are used in continental records is here: the "gleaming sword"
and the "flame crackling," the "destruction" of cities (which afterward quietly continue an
unbroken life!) and all the rest of it. We know perfectly well that on the Continent similar
language was used to describe the predatory actions of little bodies of barbarian auxiliaries;
actions calamitous and tragic no doubt, but not universal and in no way finally destructive
of civilization.

It must not be forgotten that St. Gildas also tells us of the return home of many barbarians
with plunder (which is again what we should have expected). But at the end of this account
he makes an interesting point which shows that--even if we had nothing but his written record
to judge by--the barbarian pirates had got some sort of foothold on the eastern coasts of the
island.

For after describing how the Romano-British of the province organized themselves under one
Ambrosius Aurelianus, and stood their ground, he tells us that "sometimes the citizens" (that
is, the Roman and civilized men) "sometimes the enemy were successful," down to the thorough
defeat of some raiding body or other of the Pagans at an unknown place which he calls "Mons
Badonicus." This decisive action, he also tells us, took place in the year of his own birth.

Now the importance of this last point is that Gildas after that date can talk of things which
he really knew. Let anyone who reads this page recall a great event contemporary with or nearly
following his own birth, and see how different is his knowledge of it from his knowledge of
that which came even a few years before. This is so today with all the advantages of full record.
How much greater would be the contrasts between things really known and hearsay when there
was none!

This defeat of the pagan Pirates at Mt. Badon Gildas calls the last but not the least slaughter
of the barbarians; and though he probably wrote in the West of Britain, yet we know certainly
from his contemporary evidence that during the whole of his own lifetime up to the writing
of his book--a matter of some forty-four years--there was no more serious fighting. In other
words, we are certain that the little pagan courts settled on the east coast of Britain were
balanced by a remaining mass of declining Roman civilization elsewhere, and that there was
no attempt at anything like expansion or conquest from the east westward. For this state of
affairs, remember, we have direct contemporary evidence during the whole lifetime of a man
and up to within at the most fifty years--perhaps less--from the day when St. Augustine landed
in Kent and restored record and letters to the east coast.

We have more rhetoric and more homilies about the "deserted cities and the wickedness of men
and the evil life of the Kings;" but that you might hear at any period. All we really get from
Gildas is: (1) the confused tradition of a rather heavy predatory raid conducted by barbaric
auxiliaries summoned from across the North Sea in true Roman fashion to help a Roman province
against uncivilized invaders, Scotch and Irish; (2) (which is most important) the obtaining
by these auxiliary troops or their rulers (though in small numbers it is true), of political
power over some territory within the island; (3) the early cessation of any racial struggle,
or conflict between Christian and Pagan, or between Barbarian and Roman; even of so much as
would strike a man living within the small area of Britain, and the confinement of the new
little pagan Pirate courts to the east coast during the whole of the first half of the sixth
century.

Here let us turn the light of common sense on to these most imperfect, confused and few facts
which Gildas gives us. What sort of thing would a middle-aged man, writing in the decline of
letters and with nothing but poor and demonstrably distorted verbal records to go by, set down
with regard to a piece of warfare, if (a) that man were a monk and a man of peace, (b) his
object were obviously not history, but a sermon on morals, and (c) the fighting was between
the Catholic Faith, which was all in all to the men of his time, and Pagans? Obviously he would
make all he could of the old and terrified legends of the time long before his birth, he would
get more precise as his birth approached (though always gloomy and exaggerating the evil),
and he would begin to tell us precise facts with regard to the time he could himself remember.
Well, all we get from St. Gildas is the predatory incursions of pagan savages from Scotland
and Ireland, long, long before he was born; a small number of auxiliaries called in to help
the Roman Provincials against these; the permanent settlement of these auxiliaries in some
quarter or other of the island (we know from other evidence that it was the east and southeast
coast); and (d) what is of capital importance because it is really contemporary, the settling
down of the whole matter, apparently during Gildas' own lifetime in the sixth century--from
say 500 A.D. or earlier to say 545 or later.

I have devoted so much space to this one writer, whose record would hardly count in a time
where any sufficient historical document existed, because his book is absolutely the only one
contemporary piece of evidence we have upon the pirate, or Saxon, raiding of Britain. [Footnote:
The single sentence in Prosper is insignificant--and what is more, demonstrably false as it
stands.] There are interesting fragments about it in the various documents known (to us) collectively
today as "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"--but these documents were compiled many hundreds of years
afterwards and had nothing better to go on than St. Gildas himself and possibly a few vague
legends.

Now we happen to have in this connection a document which, though not contemporary must be
considered as evidence of a kind. It is sober and full, written by one of the really great
men of Catholic and European civilization, written in a spirit of wide judgment and written
by a founder of history, the Venerable Bede.

True, the Venerable Bede's Ecclesiastical History was not produced until three hundred years
after the first raids of these predatory bands, not until nearly two hundred years after St.
Gildas, and not until one hundred and forty years after reading and writing and the full tide
of Roman civilization had come back to Eastern Britain with St. Augustine: but certain fundamental
statements of his are evidence.

Thus the fact that the Venerable Bede takes for granted permanent pirate settlements (established
as regular, if small, states), all the way along the North Sea coast from the northern part
of Britain in which he wrote, brought down to the central south by Southampton Water, is a
powerful or rather a conclusive argument in favor of the existence of such states some time
before he wrote. It is not credible that a man of this weight would write as he does without
solid tradition behind him; and he tells us that the settlers on this coast of Britain came
from three lowland Frisian tribes, German and Danish, called Saxons, Jutes and Angles.

The first name "Saxon" was at that time the name of certain pirates inhabiting two or three
small islands on the coasts between the Elbe and the Rhone. [Footnote: The name has retained
a vague significance for centuries and Is now attached to a population largely Slavonic and
wholly Protestant, south of Berlin--hundred of miles from its original seat.] Ptolemy puts
these "Saxons" two hundred years earlier, just beyond the mouth of the Elbe; the Romans knew
them as scattered pirates in the North Sea, irritating the coasts of Gaul and Britain for generations.
The name later spread to a large island confederation: but that was the way with German tribal
names. The German tribal names do not stand for fixed races or even provinces, but for chance
agglomerations which suddenly rise and as suddenly disappear. The local term, "Saxon," in the
fifth and sixth century had nothing to do with the general term, "Saxon," applied to all northwest
of the Germanies two hundred years and more afterwards. These pirates then provided small bands
of fighting men under chieftains who founded small organized governments north of the Thames
Estuary, at the head of Southampton Water, and on the Sussex coast, when they may or may not
have found (but more probably did find) existing settlements of their own people already established
as colonies by the Romans. The chiefs very probably captured the Roman fiscal organization
of the place, but seem rapidly to have degraded society by their barbaric incompetence. They
learnt no new language, but continued to talk that of their original seat on the Continent,
which language was split up into a number of local dialects, each of which was a mixture of
original German and adopted Greek, Latin and even Celtic words.

Of the Jutes we know nothing; there is a mass of modern guess work about them, valueless like
all such stuff. We must presume that they were an insignificant little tribe who sent out a
few mercenaries for hire; but they had the advantage of sending out the first, for the handful
of mercenaries whom the Roman British called into Kent were by all tradition Jutish. The Venerable
Bede also bears witness to an isolated Jutish settlement in the Meon Valley near Southampton
Water, comparable to the little German colonies established by the Romans at Bayeux in Normandy
and near Rennes.

The Angles were something more definite; they held that corner of land where the neck of Denmark
joins the mainland of Germany. This we know for certain. There was a considerable immigration
of them; enough to make their departure noticeable in the sparsely populated heaths of their
district, and to make Bede record the traveler's tale that their barren country still looked
"depopulated." How many boatloads of them, however, may have come, we have of course no sort
of record: we only know from our common sense that the number must have been insignificant
compared with the total free and slave population of a rich Roman province. Their chiefs got
a hold of the land far above the Thames Estuary, in scattered spots all up the east coast of
Britain, as far as the Firth of Forth.

There are no other authorities. There is no other evidence save St. Gildas, a contemporary
and--two hundred years after him, three hundred after the first event--Bede. A mass of legend
and worse nonsense called the Historia Brittonum exists indeed for those who consult it--but
it has no relation to historical science nor any claim to rank as evidence. As we have it,
it is centuries late, and it need not concern serious history. Even for the existence of Arthur--to
which it is the principal witness--popular legend is a much better guide. As to the original
dates of the various statements in the Historia Brittonum, those dates are guesswork. The legendary
narrative as a whole, though very ancient in its roots, dates only from a period subsequent
to Charlemagne, much more than a century later than Bede and a time far less cultured.

The life of St. Germanus, who came and preached in Britain after the Roman legions had left,
is contemporary, and deals with events sixty years before St. Gildas' birth. It would be valuable
if it told us anything about the Pirate settlements on the coast--whether these were but the
confirmation of older Roman Saxon garrisons or Roman agricultural colonies or what--but it
tells us nothing about them. We know that St. Germanus dealt in a military capacity with "Picts
and Scots"--an ordinary barbarian trouble--but we have no hint at Saxon settlements. St. Germanus
was last in Britain in 447, and it is good negative evidence that we hear nothing during that
visit of any real trouble from the Saxon pirates who at that very time might be imagined, if
legend were to be trusted, to be establishing their power in Kent.

That ends the list of witnesses; that is all our evidence. [Footnote: On such a body of evidence--less
than a morning's reading--did Green build up for popular sale his romantic Making of England.]
To sum up. So far as recorded history is concerned, all we know is this: that probably some,
but certainly only few, of the Roman regular forces were to be found garrisoned in Britain
after the year 410; that in the Roman armies there had long been Saxon and other German auxiliaries
some of whom could naturally provide civilian groups and that Rome even planted agricultural
colonies of auxiliaries permanently within the Empire; that the south and east coasts were
known as "the Saxon shore" even during Imperial times; that the savages from Scotland and Ireland
disturbed the civilized province cruelly; that scattered pirates who had troubled the southern
and eastern coasts for two centuries, joined the Scotch and Irish ravaging bands; that some
of these were taken in as regular auxiliaries on the old Roman model, somewhere about the middle
of the fifth century (the conventional date is 445); that, as happened in many another Roman
province, the auxiliaries mutinied for pay and did a good deal of bad looting and ravaging;
finally that the ravaging was checked, and that the Pirates were thrown back upon some permanent
settlements of theirs established during these disturbances along the easternmost and southernmost
coasts. Their numbers must have been very small compared with the original population. No town
of any size was destroyed.

Now it is most important in the face of such a paucity of information to seize three points:

First, that the ravaging was not appreciably worse, either in the way it is described or by
any other criterion, than the troubles which the Continent suffered at the same time and which
(as we know) did not there destroy the continuity or unity of civilization.

Secondly, that the sparse raiders, Pagan (as were also some few of those on the Continent)
and incapable of civilized effort, obtained, as they did upon the Continent (notably on the
left bank of the Rhine), little plots of territory which they held and governed for themselves,
and in which after a short period the old Roman order decayed in the incapable hands of the
newcomers.

But, thirdly (and upon this all the rest will turn), the position which these less civilized
and pagan small courts happened permanently to hold, were positions that cut the link between
the Roman province of Britain and the rest of what had been the united Roman Empire.

This last matter--not numbers, not race--is the capital point in the story of Britain between
447 and 597.

The uncivilized man happened, by a geographical accident, to have cut the communication of
the island with its sister provinces of the Empire. He was numerically as insignificant, racially
as unproductive and as ill provided with fruitful or permanent institutions as his brethren
on the Rhine or the Danube. But on the Rhine and the Danube the Empire was broad. If a narrow
fringe of it was ruined it was no great matter: only a retreat of a few miles. Those sea communications
between Britain and Europe were narrow--and the barbarian had been established across them.

The circulation of men, goods and ideas was stopped for one hundred and fifty years because
the small pirate settlements (mixed perhaps with barbarian settlements already established
by the Empire) had, by the gradual breakdown of the Roman ports, destroyed communication with
Europe from Southampton Water right north to beyond the Thames.

It seems certain that even the great town of London, whatever its commercial relations, kept
up no official or political business beyond the sea. The pirates had not gone far inland; but,
with no intention of conquest (only of loot or continued establishment), they had snapped the
bond by which Britain lived.

Such is the direct evidence, and such our first conclusion on it.

But of indirect indications, of reasonable supposition and comparison between what came after
the pirate settlements and what had been before, there is much more. By the use of this secondary
matter added to the direct evidence one can fully judge both the limits and the nature of the
misfortune that overtook Britain after the central Roman government failed and before the Roman
missionaries, who restored the province to civilization, had landed.

We may then arrive at a conclusion and know what that Britain was to which the Faith returned
with St. Augustine. When we know that, we shall know what Britain continued to be until the
catastrophe of the Reformation.

I say that, apart from the direct evidence of St. Gildas and the late but respectable traditions
gathered by the Venerable Bede, the use of other and indirect forms of evidence permits us
to be certain of one or two main facts, and a method about to be described will enable us to
add to these a half-dozen more; the whole may not be sufficient, indeed, to give us a general
picture of the time, but it will prevent us from falling into any radical error with regard
to the place of Britain in the future unity of Europe when we come to examine that unity as
it re-arose in the Middle Ages, partly preserved, partly reconstituted, by the Catholic Church.

but it is safer to believe from the combined evidence of place names and of later traditions,
that there was a real change in the common talk of most men within a march of the eastern sea
or the estuaries of its rivers.

This change in language, if it occurred (and we must presume it did, though it is not absolutely
certain, for there may have been a large amount of mixed German speech among the people before
the Roman soldiers departed)--this change of language, I say, is the chief novel matter. The
decay of religion means less, for when the pirate raids began, though the Empire was already
officially Christian at its heart, the Church had only just taken firm root in the outlying parts.

The institutions which arose in Britain everywhere when the central power of Rome decayed--the
meetings of armed men to decide public affairs, money compensation for injuries, the organizing
of society by "hundreds," etc., were common to all Europe. Nothing but ignorance can regard
them as imported into Britain (or into Ireland or Brittany for that matter) by the Pirates
of the North Sea. They are things native to all our European race when it lives simply. A little
knowledge of Europe will teach us that there was nothing novel or peculiar in such customs.
They appear universally among the Iberians as among the Celts, among the pure Germans beyond
the Rhine, the mixed Franks and Batavians upon the delta of that river, and the lowlands of
the Scheldt and the Meuse; even among the untouched Roman populations.

Everywhere you get, as the Dark Ages approach and advance, the meetings of armed men in council,
the chieftain assisted in his government by such meetings, the weaponed assent or dissent of
the great men in conference, the division of the land and people into "hundreds," the fine
for murder, and all the rest of it.

Any man who says (and most men of the last generation said it) that among the changes of the
two hundred years' gap was the introduction of novel institutions peculiar to the Germans,
is speaking in ignorance of the European unity and of that vast landscape of our civilization
which every true historian should, however dimly, possess. The same things, talked of in a
mixture of Germanic and Latin terms between Poole Harbour and the Bass Rock, were talked of
in Celtic terms from the Start to Glasgow; the chroniclers wrote them down in Latin terms alone
everywhere from the Sahara to the Grampians and from the Adriatic to the Atlantic. The very
Basques, who were so soon to begin the resistance of Christendom against the Mohammedan in
Spain, spoke of them in Basque terms. But the actual things--the institutions--for which all
these various Latins, Basque, German, and Celtic words stood (the blood-fine, the scale of
money--reparation for injury, division of society into "hundreds," the Council advising the
Chief, etc.) were much the same throughout the body of Europe. They will always reappear wherever
men of our European race are thrown into small, warring communities, avid of combat, jealous
of independence, organized under a military aristocracy and reverent of custom.

Everywhere, and particularly in Britain, the Imperial measurements survived--the measurement
of land, the units of money and of length and weight were all Roman, and nowhere more than
in Eastern Britain during the Dark Ages.

Lastly, let the reader consider the curious point of language. No more striking simulacrum
of racial unity can be discovered than a common language or set of languages; but it is a simulacrum,
and a simulacrum only. It is neither a proof nor a product of true unity. Language passes from
conqueror to conquered, from conquered to conqueror, almost indifferently. Convenience, accident,
and many a mysterious force which the historian cannot analyze, propagates it, or checks it.
Gaul, thickly populated, organized by but a few garrisons of Roman soldiers and one army corps
of occupation, learns to talk Latin universally, almost within living memory of the Roman conquest.
Yet two corners of Gaul, the one fertile and rich, the other barren, Amorica and the Basque
lands, never accept Latin. Africa, though thoroughly colonized from Italy and penetrated with
Italian blood as Gaul never was, retains the Punic speech century after century, to the very
ends of Roman rule--seven hundred years after the fall of Carthage: four hundred after the
end of the Roman Republic!

Spain, conquered and occupied by the Mohammedan, and settled in very great numbers by a highly
civilized Oriental race, talks today a Latin only just touched by Arabic influence. Lombardy,
Gallic in blood and with a strong infusion of repeated Germanic invasions (very much larger
than ever Britain had!) has lost all trace of Gallic accent, even in language, save in one
or two Alpine valleys, and of German speech retains nothing but a few rare and doubtful words.
The plain of Hungary and the Carpathian Mountains are a tesselated pavement of languages quite
dissimilar, Mongolian, Teutonic, Slav. The Balkan States have, not upon their westward or European
side, but at their extreme opposite limit, a population which continues the memory of the Empire
in its speech; and the vocabulary of the Rumanians is not the Greek of Byzantium, which civilized
them, but the Latin of Rome!

The most implacable of Mohammedans now under French rule in Algiers speak, and have spoken
for centuries, not Arabic in any form, but Berber; and the same speech reappears beyond a wide
belt of Arabic in the far desert to the south.

The Irish, a people in permanent contrast to the English, yet talk in the main the English tongue.

The French-Canadians, accepting political unity with Britain, retain their tongue and reject
English.

Look where we will, we discover in regard to language something as incalculable as the human
will, and as various as human instinct. The deliberate attempt to impose it has nearly always
failed. Sometimes it survives as the result of a deliberate policy. Sometimes it is restored
as a piece of national protest--Bohemia is an example. Sometimes it "catches on" naturally
and runs for hundreds of miles covering the most varied peoples and even the most varied civilizations
with a common veil.

Now the Roman towns were not destroyed, the original population was certainly not destroyed
even in the few original settlements of Saxon and Angles in the sea and river shores of the
East. Such civilization as the little courts of the Pirate chieftains maintained was degraded
Roman or it was nothing. But the so-called "Anglo-Saxon" language--the group of half-German
[Footnote: I say "half-German" lest the reader should think, by the use of the word "German"
or "Teutonic" that the various dialects of this sort (including those of the North Sea Pirates)
were something original, uninfluenced by Rome. It must always be remembered that with their
original words and roots was mixed an equal mass of superior words learned from the civilized
men of the South in the course of the many centuries during which Germans had served the Romans
as slaves and in arms and had met their merchants.] dialects which may have taken root before
the withdrawal of the Roman legions in the East of Britain, and which at any rate were well
rooted there a hundred years after--stood ready for one of two fates. Either it would die out
and be replaced by dialects half Celtic, half Latin vocabulary, or it would spread westward.
That the Teutonic dialects of the eastern kinglets should spread westward might have seemed
impossible. The unlettered barbarian does not teach the lettered civilized man; the pagan does
not mold the Christian. It is the other way about. Yet in point of fact that happened. Why?

Before we answer that question let us consider another point. Side by side with the entry of
civilization through the Roman missionary priests in Kent, there was going on a missionary
effort in the North of the Island of Britain, which effort was Irish. It had various Celtic
dialects for its common daily medium, though it was, of course, Roman in ritual at the altar.
The Celtic missionaries, had they alone been in the field, would have made us all Celtic speaking
today. But it was the direct mission from Rome that won, and this for the reason that it had
behind it the full tide of Europe. Letters, order, law, building, schools, re-entered England
through Kent--not through Northumberland where the Irish were preaching.

Even so the spread westward of a letterless and starved set of dialects from the little courts
of the eastern coasts (from Canterbury and Bamborough and so forth) would have been impossible
but for a tremendous accident.

St. Augustine, after his landing, proposed to the native British bishops that they should help
in the conversion of the little pagan kinglets and their courts on the eastern coast. They
would not. They had been cut off from Europe for so long that they had become warped. They
refused communion. The peaceful Roman Mission coming just at the moment when the Empire had
recovered Italy and was fully restoring itself, was thrown back on the Eastern courts. It used
them. It backed their tongue, their arms, their tradition. The terms of Roman things were carefully
translated by the priests into the Teutonic dialects of these courts; the advance of civilization
under the missionaries, recapturing more and more of the province of Britain, proceeded westward
from the courts of the Eastern kinglets. The schools, the official world--all--was now turned
by the weight of the Church against a survival of the Celtic tongues and in favor of the Eastern
Teutonic ones.

Once civilization had come back by way of the South and East, principally through the natural
gate of Kent and through the Straits of Dover which had been blocked so long, this tendency
of the Eastern dialects to spread as the language of an organized clerical officialdom and
of its courts of law, was immediately strengthened. It soon and rapidly swamped all but the
western hills. But of colonization, of the advance of a race, there was none. What advanced
was the Roman organization once more and, with it, the dialects of the courts it favored.

What we know, then, of Britain when it was re-civilized we know through Latin terms or through
the half-German dialects which ultimately and much later merge into what we call Anglo-Saxon.
An historic King of Sussex bears a Celtic name, but we read of him in the Latin, then in the
Teutonic tongues, and his realm, however feeble the proportion of over-sea blood in it, bears
an over-sea label for its court--"the South Saxon."

The mythical founder of Wessex bears a Celtic name, Cerdic: but we read of him if not in Latin
then in Anglo-Saxon. Not a cantref but a hundred is the term of social organization in England
when it is re-civilized; not an eglywys but a church [Footnote: This word "church" is a good
example of what we mean by Teutonic dialect. It is straight from the Mediterranean. The native
German word for a temple--if they had got so far as to have temples (for we know nothing of
their religion)--is lost.] is the name of the building in which the new civilization hears
Mass. The ruler, whatever his blood or the blood of his subjects, is a Cynning, not a Reg or
a Prins. His house and court are a hall [Footnote: And "hall" is again a Roman word adopted
by the Germans.] not a plâs. We get our whole picture of renovated Britain (after the Church
is restored) colored by this half-German speech. But the Britain we see thus colored is not
barbaric. It is a Christian Britain of mixed origin, of ancient municipalities cut off for
a time by the Pirate occupation of the South and East, but now reunited with the one civilization
whose root is in Rome.

This clear historical conclusion sounds so novel today that I must emphasize and confirm it.

Western Europe in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries was largely indifferent to our modern
ideas of race. Of nationality it knew nothing. It was concerned with the maintenance of the
Catholic Church especially against the outer Pagan. This filled the mind. This drove all the
mastering energies of the time. The Church, that is, all the acts of life, but especially record
and common culture, came back into a Britain which had been cut off. It reopened the gate.
It was refused aid by the Christian whom it relieved. It decided for the courts of the South
and East, taught them organization, and carried their dialects with it through the Island which
it gradually recovered for civilization.

We are now in a position to sum up our conclusions upon the matter:

Britain, connected with the rest of civilization by a narrow and precarious neck of sea-travel
over the Straits of Dover, had, in the last centuries of Roman rule, often furnished great
armies to usurpers or Imperial claimants, sometimes leaving the Island almost bare of regular
troops. But with each return of peace these armies also had returned and the rule of the central
Roman government over Britain had been fairly continuous until the beginning of the fifth century.
At that moment--in 410 A.D.--the bulk of the trained soldiers again left upon a foreign adventure.
But the central rule of Rome was then breaking down: these regulars never returned--though
many auxiliary troops may have remained.

At this moment, when every province of the West was subject to disturbance and to the over-running
of barbarian bands, small but destructive, Britain particularly suffered. Scotch, Irish and
German barbarians looted her on all sides.

These last, the Saxon pirates, brought in as auxiliaries in the Roman fashion, may already
have been settled in places upon the eastern coast, their various half-German dialects may
have already been common upon those coasts; but at any rate, after the breakdown of the Roman
order, detached communities under little local chiefs arose. The towns were not destroyed.
Neither the slaves, nor, for that matter, the greater part of the free population fell. But
wealth declined rapidly in the chaos as it did throughout Western Europe. And side by side
with this ruin came the replacing of the Roman official language by a welter of Celtic and
of half-German dialects in a mass of little courts. The new official Roman religion--certainly
at the moment of the breakdown the religion of a small minority--almost or wholly disappeared
in the Eastern pirate settlements. The Roman language similarly disappeared in the many small
principalities of the western part of the island; they reverted to their original Celtic dialects.
There was no boundary between the hotchpotch of little German-speaking territories on the East
and the little Celtic territories on the West. There was no more than a vague common feeling
of West against East or East against West; all fought indiscriminately among themselves.

After a time which could be covered by two long lives, during which decline had been very rapid,
and as noticeable in the West as in the East throughout the Island, the full influence of civilization
returned, with the landing in 597 of St. Augustine and his missionaries sent by the Pope.

But the little Pirate courts of the East happened to have settled on coasts which occupied
the gateway into the Island; it was thus through them that civilization had been cut off, and
it was through them that civilization came back. On this account:

(1) The little kingdoms tended to coalesce under the united discipline of the Church.

(2) The united British civilization so forming was able to advance gradually westward across
the island.

(3) Though the institutions of Europe were much the same wherever Roman civilization had existed
and had declined, though the councils of magnates surrounding the King, the assemblies of armed
men, the division of land and people into "hundreds" and the rest of it were common to Europe,
these things were given, over a wider and wider area of Britain, Eastern, half-German names
because it was through the courts of the Eastern kinglets that civilization had returned. The
kinglets of the East, as civilization grew, were continually fed from the Continent, strengthened
with ideas, institutions, arts, and the discipline of the Church. Thus did they politically
become more and more powerful, until the whole island, except the Cornish peninsula, Wales
and the Northwestern mountains, was more or less administered by the courts which had their
roots in the eastern coasts and rivers, and which spoke dialects cognate to those beyond the
North Sea, while the West, cut off from this Latin restoration, decayed in political power
and saw its Celtic dialects shrink in area.

By the time that this old Roman province of Britain re-arises as an ordered Christian land
in the eighth century, its records are kept not only in Latin but in the Court "Anglo-Saxon"
dialects: by far the most important being that of Winchester. Many place names, and the general
speech of its inhabitants have followed suit, and this, a superficial but a very vivid change,
is the chief outward change in the slow transformation that has been going on in Britain for
three hundred years (450-500 to 750-800).

Britain is reconquered for civilization and that easily; it is again an established part of
the European unity, with the same sacraments, the same morals, and all those same conceptions
of human life as bound Europe together even more firmly than the old central government of
Rome had bound it. And within this unity of civilized Christendom England was to remain for
eight hundred years.

VI

THE DARK AGES

So far we have traced the fortunes of the Roman Empire (that is of European civilization and
of the Catholic Church with which that civilization was identified) from the origins both of
the Church and of the Empire, to the turning point of the fifth century. We have seen the character
of that turning point.

There was a gradual decline in the power of the central monarchy, an increasing use of auxiliary
barbarian troops in the army upon which Roman society was founded, until at last (in the years
from 400 to 500 A.D.) authority, though Roman in every detail of its form, gradually ceased
to be exercised from Rome or Constantinople, but fell imperceptibly into the hands of a number
of local governments. We have seen that the administration of these local governments usually
devolved on the chief officers of the auxiliary barbarian troops, who were also, as a rule,
their chieftains by some kind of inheritance.

We have seen that there was no considerable infiltration of barbarian blood, no "invasions"
in our modern sense of the term--(or rather, no successful ones); no blotting out of civilization,
still less any introduction of new institutions or ideas drawn from barbarism.

The coast regions of Eastern Britain (the strongest example of all, for there the change was
most severe) were reconquered for civilization and for the Faith by the efforts of St. Augustine;
Africa was recaptured for the direct rule of the Emperor: so was Italy and the South of Spain.
At the end of the seventh century that which was in the future to be called Christendom (and
which is nothing more than the Roman Empire continuing though transformed) is again reunited.

What followed was a whole series of generations in which the forms of civilization were set
and crystallized in a few very simple, traditional and easily appreciated types. The whole
standard of Europe was lowered to the level of its fundamentals, as it were. The primary arts
upon which we depend for our food and drink, and raiment and shelter survived intact. The secondary
arts reposing upon these, failed and disappeared almost in proportion to their distance from
fundamental necessities of our race. History became no more than a simple chronicle. Letters,
in the finer sense, almost ceased. Four hundred years more were to pass before Europe was to
reawaken from this sort of sleep into which her spirit had retreated, and the passage from
the full civilization of Rome through this period of simple and sometimes barbarous things,
is properly called the Dark Ages.

It is of great importance for anyone who would comprehend the general story of Europe, to grasp
the nature of those half-hidden centuries. They may be compared to a lake into which the activities
of the old world flowed and stirred and then were still, and from which in good time the activities
of the Middle Ages, properly so called, were again to flow.

Again one may compare the Dark Ages to the leafsoil of a forest. They are formed by the disintegration
of an antique florescence. They are the bed from which new florescence shall spring.

It is a curious phenomenon to consider: this hibernation, or sleep: this rest of the stuff
of Europe. It leads one to consider the flux and reflux of civilization as something much more
comparable to a pulse than to a growth. It makes us remember that rhythm which is observed
in all forms of energy. It makes us doubt that mere progress from simplicity to complexity
which used to be affirmed as the main law of history.

The contemplation of the Dark Ages affords a powerful criticism of that superficial theory
of social evolution which is among the intellectual plagues of our own generation. Much more
is the story of Europe like the waking and the sleeping of a mature man, than like any indefinite
increase in the aptitudes and powers of a growing body.

Though the prime characteristic of the Dark Ages is one of recollection, and though they are
chiefly marked by this note of Europe sinking back into herself, very much more must be known
of them before we have the truth, even in its most general form.

I will put in the form of a category or list the chief points which we must bear in mind.

In the first place the Dark Ages were a period of intense military action. Christendom was
besieged from all around. It was held like a stronghold, and in those centuries of struggle
its institutions were molded by military necessities: so that Christendom has ever since had
about it the quality of a soldier. There was one unending series of attacks, Pagan and Mohammedan,
from the North, from the East and from the South; attacks not comparable to the older raids
of external hordes, eager only to enjoy civilization within the Empire, small in number and
yet ready to accept the faith and customs of Europe. The barbarian incursions of the fifth
and sixth centuries--at the end of the United Roman Empire--had been of this lesser kind. The
mighty struggles of the eighth, ninth and especially the tenth centuries--of the Dark Ages--were
a very different matter. Had the military institutions of Europe failed in that struggle, our
civilization would have been wiped out; and indeed at one or two critical points, as in the
middle of the eighth against the Mohammedan, and at the end of the ninth century against the
northern pirates, all human judgment would have decided that Europe was doomed.

In point of fact, as we shall see in a moment, Europe was just barely saved. It was saved by
the sword and by the intense Christian ideal which nerved the sword arm. But it was only just
barely saved.

The first assault came from Islam.

A new intense and vividly anti-Christian thing arose in a moment, as it were, out of nothing,
out of the hot sands to the East and spread like a fire. It consumed all the Levant. It arrived
at the doors of the West. This was no mere rush of barbarism. The Mohammedan world was as cultured
as our own in its first expansion. It maintained a higher and an increasing culture while ours
declined; and its conquest, where it conquered us, was the conquest of something materially
superior for the moment over the remaining arts and traditions of Christian Europe.

Just at the moment when Britain was finally won back to Europe, and when the unity of the West
seemed to be recovered (though its life had fallen to so much lower a plane), we lost North
Africa; it was swept from end to end in one tidal rush by that new force which aimed fiercely
at our destruction. Immediately afterwards the first Mohammedan force crossed the Straits of
Gibraltar; and in a few months after its landing the whole of the Spanish Peninsula, that strong
Rock as it had seemed of ancient Roman culture, the hard Iberian land, crumbled. Politically,
at least, and right up to the Pyrenees, Asia had it in its grip. In the mountain valleys alone,
and especially in the tangle of highlands which occupies the northwestern corner of the Spanish
square, individual communities of soldiers held out. From these the gradual reconquest of Spain
by Christendom was to proceed, but for the moment they were crowded and penned upon the Asturian
hills like men fighting against a wall.

Even Gaul was threatened: a Mohammedan host poured up into its very centre far beyond Poitiers:
halfway to Tours. Luckily it was defeated; but Moslem garrisons continued to hold out in the
Southern districts, in the northern fringes of the Pyrenees and along the shore line of the
Narbonese and Provence.

Southern Italy was raided and partly occupied. The islands of the Mediterranean fell.

Against this sudden successful spring which had lopped off half of the West, the Dark Ages,
and especially the French of the Dark Ages, spent a great part of their military energy. The
knights of Northern Spain and the chiefs of the unconquered valleys recruited their forces
perpetually from Gaul beyond the Pyrenees; and the northern valley of the Ebro, the high plains
of Castile and Leon, were the training ground of European valor for three hundred years. The
Basques were the unyielding basis of all the advance.

This Mohammedan swoop was the first and most disastrously successful of the three great assaults.

Next came the Scandinavian pirates.

Their descent was a purely barbaric thing, not numerous but (since pirates can destroy much
with small numbers) for centuries unexhausted. They harried all the rivers and coasts of Britain,
of Gaul, and of the Netherlands. They appeared in the Southern seas and their efforts seemed
indefatigable. Britain especially (where the raiders bore the local name of "Danes") suffered
from a ceaseless pillage, and these new enemies had no attraction to the Roman land save loot.
They merely destroyed. They refused our religion. Had they succeeded they would not have mingled
with us, but would have ended us.

Both in Northern Gaul and in Britain their chieftains acquired something of a foothold, but
only after the perilous moment in which their armies were checked; they were tamed and constrained
to accept the society they had attacked.

This critical moment when Europe seemed doomed was the last generation of the ninth century.
France had been harried up to the gates of Paris. Britain was so raided that its last independent
king, Alfred, was in hiding.

Both in Britain and Gaul Christendom triumphed and in the same generation.

Paris stood a successful siege, and the family which defended it was destined to become the
royal family of all France at the inception of the Middle Ages. Alfred of Wessex in the same
decade recovered South England. In both provinces of Christendom the situation was saved. The
chiefs of the pirates were baptized; and though Northern barbarism remained a material menace
for another hundred years, there was no further danger of our destruction.

Finally, less noticed by history, but quite as grievous, and needing a defence as gallant,
was the pagan advance over the North German Plain and up the valley of the Danube.

All the frontier of Christendom upon this line from Augsburg and the Lech to the course of
the Elbe and the North Sea, was but a line of fortresses and continual battlefields. It was
but recently organized land. Until the generations before the year 800 there was no civilization
beyond the Rhine save the upper Danube partially reclaimed, and a very scanty single extension
up the valley of the Lower Main.

But Charlemagne, with vast Gallic armies, broke into the barbaric Germanies right up to the
Elbe. He compelled them by arms to accept religion, letters and arts. He extended Europe to
these new boundaries and organized them as a sort of rampart in the East: a thing the Roman
Empire had not done. The Church was the cement of this new belt of defence--the imperfect population
of which were evangelized from Ireland and Britain. It was an experiment, this creation of
the Germanies by Western culture, this spiritual colonization of a March beyond the limits
of the Empire. It did not completely succeed, as the Reformation proves; but it had at least
the strength in the century after Charlemagne, its founder, to withstand the Eastern attack
upon Christendom.

The attack was not racial. It was Pagan Slav, mixed with much that was left of Pagan German,
even Mongol. Its character was the advance of the savage against the civilized man, and it
remained a peril two generations longer than the peril which Gaul and Britain had staved off
from the North.

This, then, is the first characteristic to be remembered of the Dark Ages: the violence of
the physical struggle and the intense physical effort by which Europe was saved.

The second characteristic of the Dark Ages proceeds from this first military one: it may be
called Feudalism.

Briefly it was this: the passing of actual government from the hands of the old Roman provincial
centres of administration into the hands of each small local society and its lord. On such
a basis there was a reconstruction of society from below: these local lords associating themselves
under greater men, and these again holding together in great national groups under a national
overlord.

In the violence of the struggle through which Christendom passed, town and village, valley
and castle, had often to defend itself alone.

The great Roman landed estates, with their masses of dependents and slaves, under a lord or
owner, had never disappeared. The descendants of these Roman, Gallic, British, owners formed
the fighting class of the Dark Ages, and in this new function of theirs, perpetually lifted
up to be the sole depositories of authority in some small imperiled countryside, they grew
to be nearly independent units. For the purposes of cohesion that family which possessed most
estates in a district tended to become the leader of it. Whole provinces were thus formed and
grouped, and the vaguer sentiments of a larger unity expressed themselves by the choice of
some one family, one of the most powerful in every county, who would be the overlord of all
the other lords, great and small.

Side by side with this growth of local independence and of voluntary local groupings, went
the transformation of the old imperial nominated offices into hereditary and personal things.

A count, for instance, was originally a "comes" or "companion" of the Emperor. The word dates
from long before the break-up of the central authority of Rome. A count later was a great official:
a local governor and judge--the Vice-Roy of a large district (a French county and English shire).
His office was revocable, like other official appointments. He was appointed for a season,
first at the Emperor's, later at the local King's discretion, to a particular local government.
In the Dark Ages the count becomes hereditary. He thinks of his government as a possession
which his son should rightly have after him. He bases his right to his government upon the
possession of great estates within the area of that government. In a word, he comes to think
of himself not as an official at all but as a feudal overlord, and all society (and the remaining
shadow of central authority itself) agrees with him.

The second note, then, of the Dark Ages is the gradual transition of Christian society from
a number of slave-owning, rich, landed proprietors, taxed and administered by a regular government,
to a society of fighting nobles and their descendants, organized upon a basis of independence
and in a hierarchy of lord and overlord, and supported no longer by slaves in the villages,
but by half-free serfs or "villeins."

Later an elaborate theory was constructed in order to rationalize this living and real thing.
It was pretended--by a legal fiction--that the central King owned nearly all the land, that
the great overlords "held" their land of him, the lesser lords "holding" theirs hereditarily
of the overlords, and so forth. This idea of "holding" instead of "owning," though it gave
an easy machinery for confiscation in time of rebellion, was legal theory only, and, so far
as men's views of property went, a mere form. The reality was what I have described.

The third characteristic of the Dark Ages was the curious fixity of morals, of traditions,
of the forms of religion, and of all that makes up social life.

We may presume that all civilization originally sprang from a soil in which custom was equally
permanent.

We know that in the great civilizations of the East an enduring fixity of form is normal.

But in the general history of Europe, it has been otherwise. There has been a perpetual flux
in the outward form of things, in architecture, in dress, and in the statement of philosophy
as well (though not in its fundamentals).

In this mobile surface of European history the Dark Ages form a sort of island of changelessness.
There is an absence of any great heresies in the West, and, save in one or two names, an absence
of speculation. It was as though men had no time for any other activity but the ceaseless business
of arms and of the defence of the West.

Consider the life of Charlemagne, who is the central figure of those centuries. It is spent
almost entirely in the saddle. One season finds him upon the Elbe, the next upon the Pyrenees.
One Easter he celebrates in Northern Gaul, another in Rome. The whole story is one of perpetual
marching, and of blows parrying here, thrusting there, upon all the boundaries of isolated
and besieged Christendom. He will attend to learning, but the ideal of learning is repetitive
and conservative: its passion is to hold what was, not to create or expand. An anxious and
sometimes desperate determination to preserve the memory of a great but half-forgotten past
is the business of his court, which dissolves just before the worst of the Pagan assault; as
it is the business of Alfred, who arises a century later, just after the worst assault has
been finally repelled.

Religion during these centuries settled and consolidated, as it were. An enemy would say that
it petrified, a friend that it was enormously strengthened by pressure. But whatever the metaphor
chosen, the truth indicated will be this: that the Catholic Faith became between the years
600 and 1000 utterly one with Europe. The last vestiges of the antique and Pagan civilization
of the Mediterranean were absorbed. A habit of certitude and of fixity even in the details
of thought was formed in the European mind.

It is to be noted in this connection that geographically the centre of things had somewhat
shifted. With the loss of Spain and of Northern Africa, the Mohammedan raiding of Southern
Italy and the islands, the Mediterranean was no longer a vehicle of Western civilization, but
the frontier of it. Rome itself might now be regarded as a frontier town. The eruption of the
barbarians from the East along the Danube had singularly cut off the Latin West from Constantinople
and from all the high culture of its Empire. Therefore, the centre of that which resisted in
the West, the geographical nucleus of the island of Christendom, which was besieged all round,
was France, and in particular Northern France. Northern Italy, the Germanies, the Pyrenees
and the upper valley of the Ebro were essentially the marches of Gaul. Gaul was to preserve
all that could be preserved of the material side of Europe, and also of the European spirit.
And therefore the New World, when it arose, with its Gothic Architecture, its Parliaments,
its Universities, and, in general, its spring of the Middle Ages, was to be a Gallic thing.

The fourth characteristic of the Dark Ages was a material one, and was that which would strike
our eyes most immediately if we could transfer ourselves in time, and enjoy a physical impression
of that world. This characteristic was derived from what I have just been saying. It was the
material counterpart of the moral immobility or steadfastness of the time. It was this: that
the external forms of things stood quite unchanged. The semi-circular arch, the short, stout
pillar, occasionally (but rarely) the dome: these were everywhere the mark of architecture.
There was no change nor any attempt at change. The arts were saved but not increased, and the
whole of the work that men did with their hands stood fast in mere tradition. No new town arises.
If one is mentioned (Oxford, for instance) for the first time in the Dark Ages, whether in
Britain or in Gaul, one may fairly presume a Roman origin for it, even though there be no actual
mention of it handed down from Roman times.

No new roads were laid. The old Roman military system of highways was kept up and repaired,
though kept up and repaired with a declining vigor. The wheel of European life had settled
to one slow rate of turning.

Not only were all these forms enduring, they were also few and simple. One type of public building
and of church, one type of writing, everywhere recognizable, one type of agriculture, with
very few products to differentiate it, alone remained.

The fifth characteristic of the Dark Ages is one apparently, but only apparently, contradictory
of that immobile and fundamental character which I have just been describing. It is this: the
Dark Ages were the point during which there very gradually germinated and came into outward
existence things which still remain among us and help to differentiate our Christendom from
the past of classical antiquity.

This is true of certain material things. The spur, the double bridle, the stirrup, the book
in leaves distinct from the old roll--and very much else. It is true of the road system of
Europe wherever that road system has departed from the old Roman scheme. It was in the Dark
Ages with the gradual break-down of expensive causeways over marshes; with the gradual decline
of certain centres; with bridges left unrepaired; culverts choked and making a morass against
the dam of the roads, that you got the deflection of the great ways. In almost every broad
river valley in England, where an old Roman road crosses the stream and its low-lying banks,
you may see something which the Dark Ages left to us in our road system: you may see the modern
road leaving the old Roman line and picking its way across the wet lands from one drier point
to another, and rejoining the Roman line beyond. It is a thing you will see in almost anyone
of our Strettons, Stanfords, Stamfords, Staffords, etc., which everywhere mark the crossing
of a Roman road over a water course.

But much more than in material things the Dark Ages set a mold wherein the European mind grew.
For instance, it was they that gave to us two forms of legend. The one something older than
history, older than the Roman order, something Western reappearing with the release of the
mind from the rigid accuracy of a high civilization; the other that legend which preserves
historical truth under a guise of phantasy.

Of the first, the British story of Tristan is one example out of a thousand. Of the second,
the legend of Constantine, which gradually and unconsciously developed into the famous Donation.

The Dark Ages gave us that wealth of story coloring and enlivening all our European life, and
what is more, largely preserving historic truth; for nothing is more valuable to true history
than legend. They also gave us our order in speech. Great hosts of words unknown to antiquity
sprang up naturally among the people when the force of the classical centre failed. Some of
them were words of the languages before the Roman armies came--cask, for instance, the old
Iberian word. Some of them were the camp talk of the soldiers. Spade, for instance, and "épée,"
the same piece of Greek slang, "the broad one," which has come to mean in French a sword; in
English that with which we dig the earth. Masses of technical words in the old Roman laws turned
into popular usage through that appetite the poor have for long official phrases: for instance,
our English words wild, weald, wold, waste, gain, rider, rode, ledge, say, and a thousand others,
all branch out from the lawyers' phrases of the later Roman Empire.

In this closed crucible of the Dark Ages crystallized also--by a process which we cannot watch,
or of which we have but glimpses--that rich mass of jewels, the local customs of Europe, and
even the local dress, which differentiates one place from another, when the communications
of a high material civilization break down. In all this the Dark Ages are a comfort to the
modern man, for he sees by their example that the process of increasing complexity reaches
its term; that the strain of development is at last relieved; that humanity sooner or later
returns upon itself; that there is an end in repose and that the repose is fruitful.

The last characteristic of the Dark Ages is that which has most engrossed, puzzled, and warped
the judgment of non-Catholic historians when they have attempted a conspectus of European development;
it was the segregation, the homogeneity of and the dominance of clerical organization. The
hierarchy of the Church, its unity and its sense of discipline was the chief civil institution
and the chief binding social force of the times. Side by side with it went the establishment
of the monastic institution which everywhere took on a separate life of its own, preserved
what could be preserved of arts and letters, drained the marshes and cleared the forests, and
formed the ideal economic unit for such a period; almost the only economic unit in which capital
could then be accumulated and preserved. The great order of St. Benedict formed a framework
of living points upon which was stretched the moral life of Europe. The vast and increasing
endowments of great and fixed religious houses formed the economic flywheel of those centuries.
They were the granary and the storehouse. But for the monks, the fluctuations proceeding from
raid and from decline would, in their violence, at some point or another, have snapped the
chain of economic tradition, and we should all have fallen into barbarism.

Meanwhile the Catholic hierarchy as an institution--I have already called it by a violent metaphor,
a civil institution--at any rate as a political institution--remained absolute above the social
disintegration of the time.

All natural things were slowly growing up unchecked and disturbing the strict lines of the
old centralized governmental order which men still remembered. In language Europe was a medley
of infinitely varying local dialects.

Thousands upon thousands of local customs were coming to be separate laws in each separate village.

Legend, as I have said, was obscuring fixed history. The tribal basis from which we spring
was thrusting its instincts back into the strict and rational Latin fabric of the State. Status
was everywhere replacing contract, and habit replacing a reason for things. Above this medley
the only absolute organization that could be was that of the Church. The Papacy was the one
centre whose shifting could not even be imagined. The Latin tongue, in the late form in which
the Church used it, was everywhere the same, and everywhere suited to rituals that differed
but slightly from province to province when we contrast them with the millioned diversity of
local habit and speech.

Whenever a high civilization was to re-arise out of the soil of the Dark Ages, it was certain
first to show a full organization of the Church under some Pope of exceptional vigor, and next
to show that Pope, or his successors in this tradition, at issue with new civil powers. Whenever
central government should rise again and in whatever form, a conflict would begin between the
new kings and the clerical organization which had so strengthened itself during the Dark Ages.

Now Europe, as we know, did awake from its long sleep. The eleventh century was the moment
of its awakening. Three great forces--the personality of St. Gregory VII., the appearance (by
a happy accident of slight cross breeding: a touch of Scandinavian blood added to the French
race) of the Norman race, finally the Crusades--drew out of the darkness the enormous vigor
of the early Middle Ages. They were to produce an intense and active civilization of their
own; a civilization which was undoubtedly the highest and the best our race has known, conformable
to the instincts of the European, fulfilling his nature, giving him that happiness which is
the end of men.

As we also know, Europe on this great experiment of the Middle Ages, after four hundred years
of high vitality, was rising to still greater heights when it suffered shipwreck.

With that disaster, the disaster of the Reformation, I shall deal later in this series.

In my next chapter I shall describe the inception of the Middle Ages, and show what they were
before our promise in them was ruined.

VII

THE MIDDLE AGES

I said in my last chapter that the Dark Ages might be compared to a long sleep of Europe: a
sleep lasting from the fatigue of the old society in the fifth century to the spring and rising
of the eleventh and twelfth. The metaphor is far too simple, of course, for that sleep was
a sleep of war. In all those centuries Europe was desperately holding its own against the attack
of all that desired to destroy it: refined and ardent Islam from the South, letterless barbarian
pagans from the East and North. At any rate, from that sleep or that besieging Europe awoke
or was relieved.

I said that three great forces, humanly speaking, worked this miracle; the personality of St.
Gregory VII.; the brief appearance, by a happy accident, of the Norman State; and finally the
Crusades.

The Normans of history, the true French Normans we know, are stirring a generation after the
year 1000. St. Gregory filled that same generation. He was a young man when the Norman effort
began. He died, full of an enormous achievement, in 1085. As much as one man could, he, the
heir of Cluny, had re-made Europe. Immediately after his death there was heard the march of
the Crusades. From these three the vigor of a fresh, young, renewed Europe proceeds.

Much might be added. The perpetual and successful chivalric charge against the Mohammedan in
Spain illumined all that time and clarified it. Asia was pushed back from the Pyrenees, and
through the passes of the Pyrenees perpetually cavalcaded the high adventurers of Christendom.
The Basques--a strange and very strong small people--were the pivot of that reconquest, but
the valley of the torrent of the Aragon was its channel. The life of St. Gregory is contemporaneous
with that of El Cid Campeador. In the same year that St. Gregory died, Toledo, the sacred centre
of Spain, was at last forced from the Mohammedans, and their Jewish allies, and firmly held.
All Southern Europe was alive with the sword.

In that same moment romance appeared; the great songs: the greatest of them all, the Song of
Roland; then was a ferment of the European mind, eager from its long repose, piercing into
the undiscovered fields. That watching skepticism which flanks and follows the march of the
Faith when the Faith is most vigorous had also begun to speak.

There was even some expansion beyond the boundaries eastward, so that something of the unfruitful
Baltic Plain was reclaimed. Letters awoke and Philosophy. Soon the greatest of all human exponents,
St. Thomas Aquinas, was to appear. The plastic arts leapt up: Color and Stone. Humor fully
returned: general travel: vision. In general, the moment was one of expectation and of advance.
It was spring.

For the purposes of these few pages I must confine the attention of my reader to those three
tangible sources of the new Europe, which, as I have said, were the Normans, St. Gregory VII.,
and the Crusades.

Of the Norman race we may say that it resembled in history those miræ or new stars which flare
out upon the darkness of the night sky for some few hours or weeks or years, and then are lost
or merged in the infinity of things. He is indeed unhistorical who would pretend William the
Conqueror, the organizer and maker of what we now call England, Robert the Wizard, the conquerors
of Sicily, or any of the great Norman names that light Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
to be even partly Scandinavians. They were Gauls: short in stature, lucid in design, vigorous
in stroke, positive in philosophy. They bore no outward relation to the soft and tall and sentimental
North from which some few of their remote ancestry had drawn ancestral names.

But on the other hand, anyone who should pretend that this amazing and ephemeral phenomenon,
the Norman, was merely Gallo-Roman, would commit an error: an error far less gross but still
misleading. In speech, in manner, in accoutrement, in the very trick of riding the horse, in
the cooking of food, in that most intimate part of man, his jests, the Norman was wholly and
apparently a Gaul. In his body--hard, short, square, broad-shouldered, alert--the Norman was
a Frenchman only. But no other part of Gaul then did what Normandy did: nor could any other
French province show, as Normandy showed, immediate, organized and creative power, during the
few years that the marvel lasted.

That marvel is capable of explanation and I will attempt to explain it. Those dull, blundering
and murderous ravagings of the coasts of Christian Europe by the pirates of Scandinavia (few
in number, futile in achievement) which we call in English history, "The Danish Invasions,"
were called upon the opposite coast of the Channel, "The Invasions of the Nordmanni" or "the
Men of the North." They came from the Baltic and from Norway. They were part of the universal
assault which the Dark Ages of Christendom had to sustain: part of a ceaseless pressure from
without against civilization; and they were but a part of it. They were few, as pirates always
must be. It was on the estuaries of a few continental rivers and in the British Isles that
they counted most in the lives of Europeans.

Now among the estuaries of the great rivers was the estuary of the Seine. The Scandinavian
pirates forced it again and again. At the end of the ninth century they had besieged Paris,
which was then rapidly becoming the political centre of Gaul.

So much was there left of the Roman tradition in that last stronghold of the Roman Empire that
the quieting of invading hordes by their settlement (by inter-marriage with and granting of
land in, a fixed Roman province) was a policy still obvious to those who still called themselves
"The Emperors" of the West.

In the year 911 this antique method, consecrated by centuries of tradition, produced its last
example and the barbarian troublers from the sea were given a fixed limit of land wherein they
might settle. The maritime province "Lugdunensis Secunda" [Footnote: The delimitation of this
province dated from Diocletian. It was already six hundred years old, its later name of "Normandy"
masked this essential fact that it was and is a Roman division, as for that matter are probably
our English counties.] was handed over to them for settlement, that is, they might not attempt
a partition of the land outside its boundaries.

On the analogy of all similar experiments we can be fairly certain of what happened, though
there is no contemporary record of such domestic details in the case of Normandy.

The barbarians, few in number, coming into a fertile and thickly populated Roman province,
only slightly affected its blood, but their leaders occupied waste land, planted themselves
as heirs of existing childless lords, took to wife the heiresses of others; enfeoffed groups
of small men; took a share of the revenue; helped to answer for military levy and general government.
Their chief was responsible to the crown.

To the mass of the population the new arrangement would make no change; they were no longer
slaves, but they were still serfs. Secure of their small farms, but still bound to work for
their lord, it mattered little to them whether that lord of theirs had married his daughter
to a pirate or had made a pirate his heir or his partner in the management of the estate. All
the change the serf would notice from the settlement was that the harrying and the plundering
of occasional barbarian raids had ceased.

In the governing class of perhaps some ten to twenty thousand families the difference would
be very noticeable indeed. The pirate newcomers, though insignificant in number compared with
the total population, were a very large fraction added to so small a body. The additional blood,
though numerically a small proportion, permeated rapidly throughout the whole community. Scandinavian
names and habits may have had at first some little effect upon the owner-class with which the
Scandinavians first mingled; it soon disappeared. But, as had been the case centuries before
in the earlier experiments of that sort, it was the barbarian chief and his hereditary descendants
who took over the local government and "held it," as the phrase went, of the universal government
of Gaul.

These "North-men," the new and striking addition to the province, the Gallo-Romans called,
as we have seen "Nordmanni." The Roman province, within the limits of which they were strictly
settled, the second Lyonnese, came to be called "Normannia." For a century the slight admixture
of new blood worked in the general Gallo-Roman mass of the province and, numerically small
though it was, influenced its character, or rather produced a new thing; just as in certain
chemical combinations the small admixture of a new element transforms the whole. With the beginning
of the eleventh century, as everything was springing into new life, when the great saint who,
from the chair of Peter, was to restore the Church was already born, when the advance of the
Pyreneans against Islam was beginning to strike its decisive conquering blows, there appeared,
a sudden phenomenon, this new thing--French in speech and habit and disposition of body, yet
just differentiated from the rest of Frenchmen--the Norman Race.

It possessed these characteristics--a great love of exact order, an alert military temper and
a passion for reality which made its building even of ships (though it was not in the main
seafaring) excellent, and of churches and of castles the most solid of its time.

All the Normans' characteristics (once the race was formed), led them to advance. They conquered
England and organized it; they conquered and organized Sicily and Southern Italy; they made
of Normandy itself the model state in a confused time; they surveyed land; they developed a
regular tactic for mailed cavalry. Yet they endured for but a hundred years, and after that
brief coruscation they are wholly merged again in the mass of European things!

You may take the first adventurous lords of the Cotentin in, say 1030, for the beginning of
the Norman thing; you may take the Court of young Henry II. with his Southerners and his high
culture in, say 1160, most certainly for the burial of it. During that little space of time
the Norman had not only reintroduced exactitude in the government of men, he had also provided
the sword of the new Papacy and he had furnished the framework of the crusading host. But before
his adventure was done the French language and the writ of Rome ran from the Grampians to the
Euphrates.

Of the Papacy and the Crusades I now speak.

St. Gregory VII., the second of the great re-creative forces of that time, was of the Tuscan
peasantry, Etrurian in type, therefore Italian in speech, by name Hildebrand. Whether an historian
understands his career or no is a very test of whether that historian understands the nature
of Europe. For St. Gregory VII. imposed nothing upon Europe. He made nothing new. What he did
was to stiffen the ideal with reality. He provoked a resurrection of the flesh. He made corporate
the centralized Church and the West.

For instance; it was the ideal, the doctrine, the tradition, the major custom by far, that
the clergy should be celibate. He enforced celibacy as universal discipline.

The awful majesty of the Papacy had been present in all men's minds as a vast political conception
for centuries too long to recall; St. Gregory organized that monarchy, and gave it proper instruments
of rule.

The Unity of the Church had been the constant image without which Christendom could not be;
St. Gregory VII. at every point made that unity tangible and visible. The Protestant historians
who, for the most part, see in the man a sporadic phenomenon, by such a misconception betray
the source of their anæmia and prove their intellectual nourishment to be unfed from the fountain
of European life. St. Gregory VII. was not an inventor, but a renovator. He worked not upon,
but in, his material; and his material was the nature of Europe: our nature.

Of the awful obstacles such workers must encounter all history speaks. They are at conflict
not only with evil, but with inertia; and with local interest, with blurred vision and with
restricted landscapes. Always they think themselves defeated, as did St. Gregory when he died.
Always they prove themselves before posterity to have done much more than any other mold of
man. Napoleon also was of this kind.

When St. Gregory was dead the Europe which he left was the monument of that triumph whose completion
he had doubted and the fear of whose failure had put upon his dying lips the phrase: "I have
loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore I die in exile."

Immediately after his death came the stupendous Gallic effort of the Crusades.

 It was
partly too much a taking of things for granted, a conviction that nothing could really upset
the unity of Europe; partly the huge concentration of wealth in clerical hands, which proceeded
from the new economic activity all over Europe, coupled with the absolute power of the clergy
in certain centres and the universal economic function of Rome; partly a popular loss of faith.
All these between them helped to do the business. At any rate the evil was there.

All institutions (says Machiavelli) must return to their origins, or they fail. There appeared
throughout Europe in the last century of united Europe, breaking out here and there, sporadic
attempts to revivify the common life, especially upon its spiritual side, by a return to the
primitive communal enthusiasms in which religion necessarily has its historical origins.

This was in no way remarkable. Neither was it remarkable that each such sporadic and spontaneous
outburst should have its own taint or vice or false color.

What was remarkable and what made the period unique in the whole history of Christendom (save
for the Arian flood) was the incapacity of the external organization of the Church at the moment
to capture the spiritual discontent, and to satisfy the spiritual hunger of which these errors
were the manifestation.

In a slower time the external organization of the Church would have absorbed and regulated
the new things, good and evil. It would have rendered the heresies ridiculous in turn, it would
have canalized the exaltations, it would have humanized the discoveries. But things were moving
at a rate more and more rapid, the whole society of Western Christendom raced from experience
to experience. It was flooded with the newly found manuscripts of antiquity, with the new discoveries
of unknown continents, with new commerce, printing, and, an effect perhaps rather than a cause,
the complete rebirth of painting, architecture, sculpture and all the artistic expression of
Europe.

In point of fact this doubt and seething and attempted return to early religious enthusiasm
were not digested and were not captured. The spiritual hunger of the time was not fed. Its
extravagance was not exposed to the solvent of laughter or to the flame of a sufficient indignation:
they were therefore neither withered nor eradicated. For the spirit had grown old. The great
movement of the spirit in Europe was repressed haphazard and, quite as much haphazard, encouraged,
but there seemed no one corporate force present throughout Christendom which would persuade,
encourage and command: even the Papacy, the core of our unity, was shaken by long division
and intrigue.

Let it be clearly understood that in the particular form of special heresies the business was
local, peculiar and contemptible. Wycliffe, for instance, was no more the morning star of the
Reformation than Catherine of Braganza's Tangier Dowry, let us say, was the morning star of
the modern English Empire. Wycliffe was but one of a great number of men who were theorizing
up and down Europe upon the nature of society and morals, each with his special metaphysic
of the Sacrament; each with his "system." Such men have always abounded; they abound today.
Some of Wycliffe's extravagances resemble what many Protestants happen, later, to have held;
others (such as his theory that you could not own land unless you were in a state of grace)
were of the opposite extreme to Protestantism. And so it is with the whole lot: and there were
hundreds of them. There was no common theory, no common feeling in the various reactions against
a corrupted ecclesiastical authority which marked the end of the Middle Ages. There was nothing
the least like what we call Protestantism today. Indeed that spirit and mental color does not
appear until a couple of generations after the opening of the Reformation itself.

What there was, was a widespread discontent and exasperated friction against the existing,
rigid, and yet deeply decayed, temporal organization of religious affairs; and in their uneasy
fretting against that unworthy rule, the various centres of irritation put up now one startling
theory which they knew would annoy the official Church, now another, perhaps the exact opposite
of the last. Now they denied something as old as Europe--such as the right to property: now
a new piece of usage or discipline such as Communion in one kind: now a partial regional rule,
such as celibacy. Some went stark mad. Others, at the contrary extreme, did no more than expose
false relics.

A general social ill-ease was the parent of all these sporadic heresies. Many had elaborate
systems, but none of these systems was a true creed, that is, a motive. No one of the outbursts
had any philosophic driving power behind it; all and each were no more than violent and blind
reactions against a clerical authority which gave scandal and set up an intolerable strain.

Shall I give an example? One of the most popular forms which the protest took, was what I have
just mentioned, a demand for Communion in both kinds and for the restoration of what was in
many places ancient custom, the drinking from the cup after the priest.

Could anything better prove the truth that mere irritation against the external organization
of the Church was the power at work? Could any point have less to do with the fundamentals
of the Faith? Of course, as an implication of false doctrine--as that the Priesthood is not
an Order, or that the Presence of Our Lord is not in both species--it had its importance. But
in itself how trivial a "kick." Why should anyone desire the cup save to mark dissension from
established custom!

Here is another example. Prominent among the later expressions of discontent you have the Adamites,
[Footnote: The rise of these oddities is nearly contemporary with Wycliffe and is, like his
career, about one hundred years previous to the Reformation proper: the sects are of various
longevity. Some, like the Calvinists, have, while dwindling rapidly in numbers, kept their
full doctrines for now four hundred years, others like the Johanna Southcottites hardly last
a lifetime: others like the Modernists a decade or less: others like the Mormons near a century,
their close is not yet. I myself met a man in Colorado in 1891 whose friends thought him the
Messiah. Unlike the Wycliffites certain members of the Adamites until lately survived in Austria.]
who among other tenets rejected clothes upon the more solemn occasions of their ritual and
went naked: raving maniacs. The whole business was a rough and tumble of protest against the
breakdown of a social system whose breakdown seemed the more terrible because it had been such
a haven! Because it was in essence founded upon the most intimate appetites of European men.
The heretics were angry because they had lost their home.

This very general picture omits Huss and the national movement for which he stood. It omits
the Papal Schism; the Council of Constance; all the great facts of the fifteenth century on
its religious side. I am concerned only with the presentation of the general character of the
time, and that character was what I have described: an irrepressible, largely justified, discontent
breaking out: a sort of chronic rash upon the skin of Christian Europe, which rash the body
of Christendom could neither absorb nor cure.

Now at this point--and before we leave the fifteenth century--there is another historical feature
which it is of the utmost importance to seize if we are to understand what followed; for it
was a feature common to all European thought until a time long after the final establishment
of permanent cleavage in Europe. It is a feature which nearly all historians neglect and yet
one manifest upon the reading of any contemporary expression. That feature is this: No one
in the Reformation dreamt a divided Christendom to be possible.

This flood of heretical movement was oecumenical; it was not peculiar to one race or climate
or culture or nation. The numberless uneasy innovators thought, even the wildest of them, in
terms of Europe as a whole. They desired to affect the universal Church and change it en bloc.
They had no local ambition. They stood for no particular blood or temperament; they sprang
up everywhere, bred by the universal ill-ease of a society still universal. You were as likely
to get an enthusiast declaring himself to be the Messiah in Seville as an enthusiast denying
the Real Presence in Aberdeen.

That fatal habit of reading into the past what we know of its future has in this matter most
deplorably marred history, and men, whether Protestant or Catholic, who are now accustomed
to Protestantism, read Protestantism and the absurd idea of a local religion--a religion true
in one place and untrue in another--into a time where the least instructed clown would have
laughed in your face at such nonsense.

The whole thing, the evil coupled with a quite ineffectual resistance to the evil, was a thing
common to all Europe.

It is the nature of any organic movement to progress or to recede. But this movement was destined
to advance with devastating rapidity, and that on account of what I have called the second
factor in the Reformation: the very rapid accretion in technical power which marked the close
of the Middle Ages.

Printing; navigation; all mensuration; the handling of metals and every material--all these
took a sudden leap forward with the Renaissance, the revival of arts: that vast stirring of
the later Middle Ages which promised to give us a restored antiquity Christianized: which was
burnt in the flame of a vile fanaticism, and has left us nothing but ashes and incommiscible
salvage.

Physical knowledge, the expansion of physical experience and technical skill, were moving in
the century before the Reformation at such a rate that a contemporary spiritual phenomenon,
if it advanced at all, was bound to advance very rapidly, and this spiritual eruption in Europe
came to a head just at the moment when the contemporary expansion of travel, of economic activity
and of the revival of learning, had also emerged in their full force.

It was in the first twenty years of the sixteenth century that the coalescing of the various
forces of spiritual discontent and revolt began to be apparent. Before 1530 the general storm
was to burst and the Reformation proper to be started on its way.

But as a preliminary to that matter, the reader should first understand how another and quite
disconnected social development had prepared the way for the triumph of the reformers. This
development was the advent of Absolute Government in civil affairs.

Here and there in the long history of Europe there crops up an isolated accident, very striking,
very effective, of short duration. We have already seen that the Norman race was one of these.
Tyranny in civil government (which accompanied the Reformation) was another.

A claim to absolute monarchy is one of the commonest and most enduring of historical things.
Countless centuries of the old Empires of the East were passed under such a claim, the Roman
Empire was based upon it; the old Russian State was made by it, French society luxuriated in
it for one magnificent century, from the accession of Louis XIV. till Fontenoy. It is the easiest
and (when it works) the most prompt of all instruments.

But the sense of an absolute civil government at the moment of the Reformation was something
very different. It was a demand, an appetite, proceeding from the whole community, a worship
of civil authority. It was deification of the State and of law; it was the adoration of the
Executive.

"This governs me; therefore I will worship it and do all it tells me." Such is the formula
for the strange passion which has now and then seized great bodies of human beings intoxicated
by splendor and by the vivifying effects of command. Like all manias (for it is a mania) this
exaggerated passion is hardly comprehended once it is past. Like all manias, while it is present
it overrides every other emotion.

Europe, in the time of which I speak, suffered such a mania. The free cities manifested that
disease quite as much as the great monarchical states. In Rome itself the temporal power of
the Papal sovereign was then magnificent beyond all past parallel. In Geneva Calvin was a god.
In Spain Charles and Philip governed two worlds without question. In England the Tudor dynasty
was worshipped blindly. Men might and did rebel against a particular government, but it was
only to set up something equally absolute in its place. Not the form but the fact of government
was adored.

I will not waste the reader's time in any discussion upon the causes of that astonishing political
fever. It must suffice to say that for a moment it hypnotized the whole world. It would have
been incomprehensible to the Middle Ages. It was incomprehensible to the nineteenth century.
It wholly occupied the sixteenth. If we understand it, we largely understand what made the
success of the Reformation possible.

Well, then, the increasing discontent of the masses against the decaying forms of the Middle
Ages, and the increasing irritation against the temporal government and the organization of
the Church, came to a head just at that moment when civil government was worshipped as an awful
and almost divine thing.

Into such an atmosphere was launched the last and the strongest of the overt protests against
the old social scheme, and in particular against the existing power of the Papacy, especially
upon its economic side.

The name most prominently associated with the crisis is that of Martin Luther, an Augustinian
monk, German by birth and speech, and one of those exuberant sensual, rather inconsequential,
characters which so easily attract hearty friendships, and which can never pretend to organization
or command, though certainly to creative power. What he precisely meant or would do, no man
could tell, least of all himself. He was "out" for protest and he floated on the crest of the
general wave of change. That he ever intended, nay, that he could ever have imagined, a disruption
of the European Unity is impossible.

Luther (a voice, no leader) was but one of many: had he never lived, the great bursting wave
would have crashed onward much the same. One scholar after another (and these of every blood
and from every part of Europe) joined in the upheaval. The opposition of the old monastic training
to the newly revived classics, of the ascetic to the new pride of life, of the logician to
the mystic, all these in a confused whirl swept men of every type into the disruption. One
thing only united them. They were all inflamed with a vital necessity for change. Great names
which in the ultimate challenge refused to destroy and helped to preserve--the greatest is
that of Erasmus; great names which even appear in the roll of that of the Catholic martyrs--the
blessed Thomas More is the greatest of these--must here be counted with the names of men like
the narrow Calvin on the one hand, the large Rabelais upon the other. Not one ardent mind in
the first half of the sixteenth century but was swept into the stream.

Now all this would and must have been quieted in the process of time, the mass of Christendom
would have settled back into unity, the populace would have felt instinctively the risk they
ran of spoliation by the rich and powerful, if the popular institutions of Christendom broke
down: the masses would have all swung round to solidifying society after an upheaval (it is
their function): we should have attained repose and Europe, united again, would have gone forward
as she did after the rocking of four hundred years before--but for that other factor of which
I have spoken, the passion which this eager creative moment felt for the absolute in civil
government--that craving for the something godlike which makes men worship a flag, a throne
or a national hymn.

This it was which caught up and, in the persons of particular men, used the highest of the
tide. Certain princes in the Germanies (who had, of all the groups of Europe, least grasped
the meaning of authority) befriended here one heresiarch and there another. The very fact that
the Pope of Rome stood for one of these absolute governments put other absolute governments
against him. The wind of the business rose; it became a quarrel of sovereigns. And the sovereigns
decided, and powerful usurping nobles or leaders decided, the future of the herd.

Two further characters appeared side by side in the earthquake that was breaking up Europe.

The first was this: the tendency to fall away from European unity seemed more and more marked
in those outer places which lay beyond the original limits of the old Roman Empire, and notably
in the Northern Netherlands and in Northern Germany--where men easily submitted to the control
of wealthy merchants and of hereditary landlords.

The second was this: a profound distrust of the new movement, a reaction against it, a feeling
that moral anarchy was too profitable to the rich and the cupidinous, began at first in a dull,
later in an angry way, to stir the masses of the populace throughout all Christendom.

The stronger the old Latin sense of human equality was, the more the populace felt this, the
more they instinctively conceived of the Reformation as something that would rob them of some
ill-understood but profound spiritual guarantee against slavery, exploitation and oppression.

There began a sort of popular grumbling against the Reformers, who were now already schismatic:
their rich patrons fell under the same suspicion. By the time the movement had reached a head
and by the time the central power of the Church had been openly defied by the German princes,
this protest took, as in France and England and the valley of the Rhone (the ancient seats
of culture), a noise like the undertone of the sea before bad weather. In the outer Germanies
it was not a defence of Christendom at all, but a brutish cry for more food. But everywhere
the populace stirred.

A general observer, cognizant of what was to come, would have been certain at that moment that
the populace would rise. When it rose intelligently the movement against the Church and civilization
would come to nothing. The Revolt elsewhere--in half barbaric Europe--would come to no more
than the lopping off of outer and insignificant things. The Baltic Plain, sundry units of the
outer Germanies and Scandinavia, probably Hungary, possibly Bohemia, certain mountain valleys
in Switzerland and Savoy and France and the Pyrenees, which had suffered from lack of instruction
and could easily be recovered--these would be affected. The outer parts, which had never been
within the pale of the Roman Empire might go. But the soul and intelligence of Europe would
be kept sound; its general body would reunite and Christendom would once more reappear whole
and triumphant. It would have reconquered these outer parts at its leisure: and Poland was
a sure bastion. We should, within a century, have been ourselves once more: Christian men.

So it would have been--but for one master tragedy, which changed the whole scheme. Of the four
great remaining units of Western civilization, Iberia, Italy, Britain, Gaul, one, at this critical
moment, broke down by a tragic accident and lost continuity. It was hardly intended. It was
a consequence of error much more than an act of will. But it had full effect.

The breakdown of Britain and her failure to resist disruption was the chief event of all. It
made the Reformation permanent. It confirmed a final division in Europe.

By a curious accident, one province, extraneous to the Empire, Ireland, heroically preserved
what the other extraneous provinces, the Germanies and Scandinavia, were to lose. In spite
of the loss of Britain, and cut off by that loss from direct succor, Ireland preserved the
tradition of civilization.

It must be my next business to describe the way in which Britain failed in the struggle, and,
at the hands of the King, and of a little group of avaricious men (such as the Howards among
the gentry, and the Cecils among the adventurers) changed for the worse the history of Europe.

IX

THE DEFECTION OF BRITAIN

One thing stands out in the fate of modern Europe: the profound cleavage due to the Reformation.
One thing made that wound (it was almost mortal) so deep and lasting: the failure of one ancient
province of civilization, and one only, to keep the Faith: this province whereof I write: Britain.

The capital event, the critical moment, in the great struggle of the Faith against the Reformation,
was the defection of Britain.

It is a point which the modern historian, who is still normally anti-Catholic, does not and
cannot make. Yet the defection of Britain from the Faith of Europe three hundred years ago
is certainly the most important historical event in the last thousand years: between the saving
of Europe from the barbarians and these our own times. It is perhaps the most important historical
event since the triumph of the Catholic Church under Constantine.

Let me recapitulate the factors of the problem as they would be seen by an impartial observer
from some great distance in time, or in space, or in mental attitude. Let me put them as they
would appear to one quite indifferent to, and remote from, the antagonists.

To such an observer the history of Europe would be that of the great Roman Empire passing through
the transformation I have described: its mind first more and more restless, then more and more
tending to a certain conclusion, and that conclusion the Catholic Church.

To summarize what has gone before: the Catholic Church becomes by the fifth century the soul,
the vital principle, the continuity of Europe. It next suffers grievously from the accident,
largely geographical, of the Eastern schism. It is of its nature perpetually subject to assault;
from within, because it deals with matters not open to positive proof; from without, because
all those, whether aliens or guests or parasites, who are not of our civilization, are naturally
its enemies.

The Roman Empire of the West, in which the purity and the unity of this soul were preserved
from generation to generation, declined in its body during the Dark Ages--say, up to and rather
beyond the year 1000. It became coarsened and less in its material powers. It lost its central
organization, the Imperial Court (which was replaced first by provincial military leaders or
"kings," then, later, by a mass of local lordships jumbled into more or less national groups).
In building, in writing, in cooking, in clothing, in drawing, in sculpture, the Roman Empire
of the West (which is ourselves) forgot all but the fundamentals of its arts--but it expanded
so far as its area is concerned. A whole belt of barbaric Germany received the Roman influence--Baptism
and the Mass. With the Creed there came to these outer parts reading and writing, building
in brick and stone--all the material essentials of our civilization--and what is characteristic
of that culture, the power of thinking more clearly.

It is centuries before this slow digestion of the barbarian reached longitude ten degrees east,
and the Scandinavian peninsula. But a thousand years after Our Lord it has reached even these,
and there remains between the unbroken tradition of our civilization in the West and the schismatic
but Christian civilization of the Greek Church, nothing but a belt of paganism from the corner
of the Baltic southward, which belt is lessened, year after year, by the armed efforts and
the rational dominance of Latin culture. Our Christian and Roman culture proceeds continuously
eastward, mastering the uncouth.

After this general picture of a civilization dominating and mastering in its material decline
a vastly greater area than it had known in the height of its material excellence--this sort
of expansion in the dark--the impartial observer, whom we have supposed, would remark a sort
of dawn.

That dawn came with the eleventh century; 1000-1100. The Norman race, the sudden invigoration
of the Papacy, the new victories in Spain, at last the first Crusade, mark a turn in the tide
of material decline, and that tide works very rapidly towards a new and intense civilization
which we call that of the Middle Ages: that high renewal which gives Europe a second and most
marvelous life, which is a late reflowering of Rome, but of Rome revivified with the virtue
and the humor of the Faith.

The second thing that the observer would note in so general a picture would be the peculiar
exception formed within it by the group of large islands lying to the North and West of the
Continent. Of these the larger, Britain, had been a true Roman Province; but very early in
the process--in the middle and end of the fifth century--it had on the first assault of the
barbarians been cut off for more than the lifetime of a man. Its gate had been held by the
barbarian. Then it was re-Christianized almost as thoroughly as though even its Eastern part
had never lost the authority of civilization. The Mission of St. Augustine recaptured Britain--but
Britain is remarkable in the history of civilization for the fact that alone of civilized lands
it needed to be recaptured at all. The western island of the two, the smaller island, Ireland,
presented another exception.

It was not compelled to the Christian culture, as were the German barbarians of the Continent,
by arms. No Charlemagne with his Gallic armies forced it tardily to accept baptism. It was
not savage like the Germanies; it was therefore under no necessity to go to school. It was
not a morass of shifting tribes; it was a nation. But in a most exceptional fashion, though
already possessed, and perhaps because so possessed, of a high pagan culture of its own, it
accepted within the lifetime of a man, and by spiritual influences alone, the whole spirit
of the Creed. The civilization of the Roman West was accepted by Ireland, not as a command
nor as an influence, but as a discovery.

Now let this peculiar fate of the two islands to the north and west of the Continent remain
in the observer's mind, and he will note, when the shock of what is called "the Reformation"
comes, new phenomena attaching to those islands, cognate to their early history.

Those phenomena are the thesis which I have to present in the pages that follow.

What we call "the Reformation" was essentially the reaction of the barbaric, the ill-tutored
and the isolated places external to the old and deep-rooted Roman civilization, against the
influences of that civilization. The Reformation was not racial. Even if there were such a
physical thing as a "Teutonic Race" (and there is nothing of the kind), the Reformation shows
no coincidence with that race. The Reformation is simply the turning-back of that tide of Roman
culture which, for five hundred years, had set steadily forward and had progressively dominated
the insufficient by the sufficient, the slower by the quicker, the confused by the clear-headed.
It was a sort of protest by the conquered against a moral and intellectual superiority which
offended them. The Slavs of Bohemia joined in that sincere protest of the lately and insufficiently
civilized, quite as strongly as, and even earlier than, the vague peoples of the Sandy Heaths
along the Baltic. The Scandinavian, physically quite different from these tribes of the Baltic
Plain, comes into the game. Wretched villages in the mark of Brandenburg, as Slavonic in type
as the villages of Bohemia, revolt as naturally against exalted and difficult mystery as do
the isolated villages of the Swedish valleys or the isolated rustics of the Cevennes or the
Alps. The revolt is confused, instinctive, and therefore enjoying the sincere motive which
accompanies such risings, but deprived of unity and of organizing power. There has never been
a fixed Protestant creed. The common factor has been, and is, reaction against the traditions
of Europe.

Now the point to seize is this:

Inimical as such a revolt was to souls or (to speak upon the mere historical plane) to civilization,
bad as it was that the tide of culture should have begun to ebb from the far regions which
it had once so beneficently flooded, the Reformation, that is, the reaction against the unity,
the discipline, and the clear thought of Europe, would never have counted largely in human
affairs had it been confined to the external fringe of the civilized world. That fringe would
probably have been reconquered. The inherent force attaching to reality and to the stronger
mind should have led to its recovery. The Northern Germanies were, as a fact, reconquered when
Richelieu stepped in and saved them from their Southern superiors. But perhaps it would not
have been reconquered. Perhaps it would have lapsed quite soon into its original paganism.
At any rate European culture would have continued undivided and strong without these outer
regions. Unfortunately a far worse thing happened.

Europe was rent and has remained divided.

The disaster was accomplished through forces I will now describe.

Though the revolt was external to the foundations of Europe, to the ancient provinces of the
Empire, yet an external consequence of that revolt arose within the ancient provinces. It may
be briefly told. The wealthy took advantage within the heart of civilization itself of this
external revolt against order; for it is always to the advantage of the wealthy to deny general
conceptions of right and wrong, to question a popular philosophy and to weaken the drastic
and immediate power of the human will, organized throughout the whole community. It is always
in the nature of great wealth to be insanely tempted (though it should know from active experience
how little wealth can give), to push on to more and more domination over the bodies of men--and
it can do so best by attacking fixed social restraints.

The landed squires then, and the great merchants, powerfully supported by the Jewish financial
communities in the principal towns, felt that--with the Reformation--their opportunity had
come. The largest fortune holders, the nobles, the merchants of the ports and local capitals
even in Gaul (that nucleus and stronghold of ordered human life) licked their lips. Everywhere
in Northern Italy, in Southern Germany, upon the Rhine, wherever wealth had congested in a
few hands, the chance of breaking with the old morals was a powerful appeal to the wealthy;
and, therefore, throughout Europe, even in its most ancient seats of civilization, the outer
barbarian had allies.

These rich men, whose avarice betrayed Europe from within, had no excuse. Theirs was not any
dumb instinctive revolt like that of the Outer Germanies, the Outer Slavs, nor the neglected
mountain valleys, against order and against clear thought, with all the hard consequences that
clear thought brings. They were in no way subject to enthusiasm for the vaguer emotions roused
by the Gospel or for the more turgid excitements derivable from Scripture and an uncorrected
orgy of prophecy. They were "on the make." The rich in Montpelier and Nîmes, a knot of them
in Rome itself, many in Milan, in Lyons, in Paris, enlisted intellectual aid for the revolt,
flattered the atheism of the Renaissance, supported the strong inflamed critics of clerical
misliving, and even winked solemnly at the lunatic inspirations of obscure men and women filled
with "visions." They did all these things as though their object was religious change. But
their true object was money.

One group, and one alone, of the European nations was too recently filled with combat against
vile non-Christian things to accept any parley with this anti-Christian turmoil. That unit
was the Iberian Peninsula. It is worthy of remark, especially on the part of those who realize
that the sword fits the hand of the Church and that Catholicism is never more alive than when
it is in arms, I say it is worthy of remark by these that Spain and Portugal through the very
greatness of an experience still recent when the Reformation broke, lost the chance of combat.
There came indeed, from Spain (but from the Basque nation there) that weapon of steel, the
Society of Jesus, which St. Ignatius formed, and which, surgical and military, saved the Faith,
and therefore Europe. But the Iberian Peninsula rejecting as one whole and with contempt and
with abhorrence (and rejecting rightly) any consideration of revolt--even among its rich men--thereby
lost its opportunity for combat. It did not enjoy the religious wars which revivified France,
and it may be urged that Spain would be the stronger today had it fallen to her task, as it
did to the general populace of Gaul, to come to hand-grips with the Reformation at home, to
test it, to know it, to dominate it, to bend the muscles upon it, and to reemerge triumphant
from the struggle.

 The populace drifted here, into complete indifference, there, into orgiastic
forms of worship. The middle class went over in a solid body to the enemy. The barbarism of
the outer Germanies permeated it and transformed it. The closer-reasoned, far more perverted
and harder French heresy of Calvin partly deflected the current--and a whole new society was
formed and launched. That was the English Reformation.

Its effect upon Europe was stupendous; for, though England was cut off, England was still England.
You could not destroy in a Roman province the great traditions of municipality and letters.
It was as though a phalanx of trained troops had crossed the frontier in some border war and
turned against their former comrades. England lent, and has from that day continuously lent,
the strength of a great civilized tradition to forces whose original initiative was directed
against European civilization and its tradition. The loss of Britain was the one great wound
in the body of the Western world. It is not yet healed.

Yet all this while that other island of the group to the Northwest of Europe, that island which
had never been conquered by armed civilization as were the Outer Germanies, but had spontaneously
accepted the Faith, presented a contrasting exception. Against the loss of Britain, which had
been a Roman province, the Faith, when the smoke of battle cleared off, could discover the
astonishing loyalty of Ireland. And over against this exceptional province--Britain--now lost
to the Faith, lay an equally exceptional and unique outer part which had never been a Roman
province, yet which now remained true to the tradition of Roman men; it balanced the map like
a counterweight. The efforts to destroy the Faith in Ireland have exceeded in violence, persistence,
and cruelty any persecution in any part or time of the world. They have failed. As I cannot
explain why they have failed, so I shall not attempt to explain how and why the Faith in Ireland
was saved when the Faith in Britain went under. I do not believe it capable of an historic
explanation. It seems to me a phenomenon essentially miraculous in character, not generally
attached (as are all historical phenomena) to the general and divine purpose that governs our
large political events, but directly and specially attached. It is of great significance; how
great, men will be able to see many years hence when another definite battle is joined between
the forces of the Church and her opponents. For the Irish race alone of all Europe has maintained
a perfect integrity and has kept serene, without internal reactions and without their consequent
disturbances, the soul of Europe which is the Catholic Church.

I have now nothing left to set down but the conclusion of this disaster: its spiritual result--an
isolation of the soul; its political result--a consequence of the spiritual--the prodigious
release of energy, the consequent advance of special knowledge, the domination of the few under
a competition left unrestrained, the subjection of the many, the ruin of happiness, the final
threat of chaos.

X

CONCLUSION

The grand effect of the Reformation was the isolation of the soul.

This was its fruit: from this all its consequences proceed: not only those clearly noxious,
which have put in jeopardy the whole of our traditions and all our happiness, but those apparently
advantageous, especially in material things.

The process cannot be seen at work if we take a particular date--especially too early a date--and
call it the moment of the catastrophe. There was a long interval of confusion and doubt, in
which it was not certain whether the catastrophe would be final or no, in which its final form
remained undetermined, and only upon the conclusion of which could modern Europe with its new
divisions, and its new fates, be perceived clearly. The breach with authority began in the
very first years of the sixteenth century. It is not till the middle of the seventeenth century
at least, and even somewhat later, that the new era begins.

For more than a hundred years the conception of the struggle as an oecumenical struggle, as
something affecting the whole body of Europe, continued. The general upheaval, the revolt,
which first shook the West in the early years of the sixteenth century--to take a particular
year, the year 1517--concerned all our civilization, was everywhere debated, produced an universal
reaction met by as universal a resistance, for three generations of men. No young man who saw
the first outbreak of the storm could imagine it even in old age, as a disruption of Europe.
No such man lived to see it more than half way through.

It was not till a corresponding date in the succeeding century--or rather later--not till Elizabeth
of England and Henry IV. of France were dead (and all the protagonists, the Reformers on the
one side, Loyola, Neri, on the other, long dead) not till the career of Richelieu in the one
country and the beginnings of an aristocratic Parliament in England were apparent, that the
Reformation could clearly be seen to have separated certain districts of our civilization from
the general traditions of the whole, and to have produced, in special regions and sections
of society, the peculiar Protestant type which was to mark the future.

The work of the Reformation was accomplished, one may say, a little after the outbreak of the
Thirty Years' War. England in particular was definitely Protestant by the decade 1620-1630--hardly
earlier. The French Huguenot body, though still confused with political effort, had come to
have a separate and real existence at about the same time. The Oligarchy of Dutch merchants
had similarly cut off their part of the Low Countries from imperial rule, and virtually established
their independence. The North German Principalities and sundry smaller states of the mountains
(notably Geneva), had definitely received the new stamp. As definitely France, Bohemia, the
Danube, Poland and Italy and all the South were saved.

Though an armed struggle was long to continue, though the North Germans were nearly recaptured
by the Imperial Power and only saved by French policy, though we were to have a reflex of it
here in the Civil Wars and the destruction of the Crown, and though the last struggle against
the Stuarts and the greater general war against Louis XIV. were but sequels to the vast affair,
yet the great consequence of that affair was fixed before these wars began. The first third
of the seventeenth century launches a new epoch. From about that time there go forward upon
parallel lines the great spiritual and consequent temporal processes of modern Europe. They
have yet to come to judgment, for they are not yet fulfilled: but perhaps their judgment is near.

These processes filling the last three hundred years have been as follows: (1) A rapid extension
of physical science and with it of every other form of acquaintance with demonstrable and measurable
things. (2) The rise, chiefly in the new Protestant part of Europe (but spreading thence in
part to the Catholic) of what we call today "Capitalism," that is, the possession of the means
of production by the few, and their exploitation of the many. (3) The corruption of the principle
of authority until it was confused with mere force. (4) The general, though not universal,
growth of total wealth with the growth of physical knowledge. (5) The ever widening effect
of skepticism, which, whether masked under traditional forms or no, was from the beginning
a spirit of complete negation and led at last to the questioning not only of any human institutions,
but of the very forms of thought and of the mathematical truths. (6) With all these of course
we have had a universal mark--the progressive extension of despair.

Could anyone look back upon these three centuries from some very great distance of time, he
would see them as an episode of extraordinary extension in things that should be dissociated:
knowledge and wealth, on the one hand, the unhappiness of men upon the other. And he would
see that as the process matured, or rather as the corruption deepened, all its marks were pushed
to a degree so extreme as to jeopardize at last the very structure of European society. Physical
science acquired such power, the oppression of the poor was pushed to such a length, the reasoning
spirit in man was permitted to attain such a tottering pitch of insecurity, that a question
never yet put to Europe arose at last--whether Europe, not from external foes, but from her
own inward lesion may not fail.

Corresponding to that terrible and as yet unanswered question--the culmination of so much evil--necessarily
arises this the sole vital formula of our time: "Europe must return to the Faith, or she will
perish."

       *       *       *       *       *

I have said that the prime product of the Reformation was the isolation of the soul. That truth
contains, in its development, very much more than its mere statement might promise.

The isolation of the soul means a loss of corporate sustenance; of the sane balance produced
by general experience, the weight of security, and the general will. The isolation of the soul
is the very definition of its unhappiness. But this solvent applied to society does very much
more than merely complete and confirm human misery.

In the first place and underlying all, the isolation of the soul releases in a society a furious
new accession of force. The break-up of any stable system in physics, as in society, makes
actual a prodigious reserve of potential energy. It transforms the power that was keeping things
together with a power driving separably each component part: the effect of an explosion. That
is why the Reformation launched the whole series of material advance, but launched it chaotically
and on divergent lines which would only end in disaster. But the thing had many other results.

Thus, we next notice that the new isolation of the soul compelled the isolated soul to strong
vagaries. The soul will not remain in the void. If you blind it, it will grope. If it cannot
grasp what it appreciates by every sense, it will grasp what it appreciates by only one.

On this account in the dissolution of the corporate sense and of corporate religion you had
successive idols set up, worthy and unworthy, none of them permanent. The highest and the most
permanent was a reaction towards corporate life in the shape of a worship of nationality--patriotism.

You had at one end of the scale an extraordinary new tabus, the erection in one place of a
sort of maniac god, blood-thirsty, an object of terror. In another (or the same) a curious
new ritual observance of nothingness upon every seventh day. In another an irrational attachment
to a particular printed book. In another successive conceptions: first, that the human reason
was sufficient for the whole foundations of human life--that there were no mysteries: next,
the opposite extravagance that the human reason had no authority even in its own sphere. And
these two, though contradictory, had one root. The rationalism of the eighteenth century carried
on through the materialism of the nineteenth, the irrational doubts of Kant (which included
much emotional rubbish) carried on to the sheer chaos of the later metaphysicians, with their
denial of contradictions, and even of being. Both sprang from this necessity of the unsupported
soul to make itself some system from within: as the unsupported soul, in an evil dream, now
stifles in strict confinement and is next dissolved in some fearful emptiness.

All this, the first interior effect of the Reformation, strong in proportion to the strength
of the reforming movement, powerful in the regions or sects which had broken away, far less
powerful in those which had maintained the Faith, would seem to have run its full course, and
to have settled at last into universal negation and a universal challenge proffered to every
institution, and every postulate. But since humanity cannot repose in such a stage of anarchy,
we may well believe that there is coming, or has already begun, yet another stage, in which
the lack of corporate support for the soul will breed attempted strange religions: witchcrafts
and necromancies.

It may be so. It may be that the great debate will come up for final settlement before such
novel diseases spread far. At any rate, for the moment we are clearly in a stage of complete
negation. But it is to be repeated that this breaking up of the foundations differs in degree
with varying societies, that still in a great mass of Europe, numerically the half perhaps,
the necessary anchors of sanity still hold: and that half is the half where directly by the
practice of the Faith, or indirectly through a hold upon some part of its tradition, the Catholic
Church exercises an admitted or distant authority over the minds of men.

The next process we note is--by what some may think a paradox--also due to the isolation of
the soul. It is the process of increasing knowledge. Men acting in a fashion highly corporate
will not so readily question, nor therefore so readily examine, as will men acting alone. Men
whose major results are taken upon an accepted philosophy, will not be driven by such a need
of inquiry as those who have abandoned that guide. In the moment, more than a thousand years
ago, when the last of the evangelizing floodtide was still running strongly, a very great man
wrote of the physical sciences: "Upon such toys I wasted my youth." And another wrote, speaking
of divine knowledge: "All the rest is smoke."

But in the absences of faith, demonstrable things are the sole consolation.

There are three forms in which the human mind can hold the truth: The form of Science, which
means that we accept a thing through demonstration, and therefore cannot admit the possibility
of its opposite. The form of Opinion, which means that we accept a thing through probability,
that is through a partial, but not complete demonstration, and therefore we do not deny the
possibility of the opposite. The form of Faith, where we accept the thing without demonstration
and yet deny the possibility of its opposite, as for instance, the faith of all men, not mad,
in the existence of the universe about them, and of other human minds.

When acknowledged and defined Faith departs, it is clear that of the remaining two rivals,
Opinion has no ground against Science. That which can be demonstrated holds all the field.
Indeed, it is the mark of modern insufficiency that it can conceive of no other form of certitude
save certitude through demonstration, and therefore does not, as a rule, appreciate even its
own unproved first principles.

Well, this function of the isolated soul, inquiry and the necessity for demonstration for individual
conviction through measurement and physical fixed knowledge, has occupied, as we all know,
the three modern centuries. We all are equally familiar with its prodigious results. Not one
of them has, as yet, added to human happiness: not one but has been increasingly misused to
the misery of man. There is in the tragedy something comic also, which is the perpetual puzzlement
of these the very authors of discovery, to find that, somehow or other, discovery alone does
not create joy, and that, somehow or other, a great knowledge can be used ill, as anything
else can be used ill. Also in their bewilderment, many turn to a yet further extension of physical
science as promising, in some illogical way, relief.

A progression in physical science and in the use of instruments is so natural to man (so long
as civic order is preserved) that it would, indeed, have taken place, not so rapidly, but as
surely, had the unity of Europe been preserved. But the destruction of that unity totally accelerated
the pace and as totally threw the movement off its rails.

The Renaissance, a noble and vividly European thing, was much older than the Reformation, which
was its perversion and corruption. The doors upon modern knowledge had been opened before the
soul, which was to enter them, had been cut off from its fellows. We owe the miscarriage of
all our great endeavor in this field, not to that spring of endeavor, but to its deflection.
It is a blasphemy to deny the value of advancing knowledge, and at once a cowardice and a folly
to fear it for its supposed consequences. Its consequences are only evil through an evil use,
that is, through an evil philosophy.

In connection with this release of powerful inquiry through the isolation of the soul, you
have an apparently contradictory, and certainly supplementary effect: the setting up of unfounded
external authority. It is a curious development, one very little recognized, but one which
a fixed observance of the modern world will immediately reveal; and those who come to see it
are invariably astonished at the magnitude of its action. Men--under the very influence of
skepticism--have come to accept almost any printed matter, almost any repeated name, as an
authority infallible and to be admitted without question. They have come to regard the denial
of such authority as a sort of insanity, or rather they have in most practical affairs, come
to be divided into two groups: a small number of men, who know the truth, say, upon a political
matter or some financial arrangement, or some unsolved problem; and a vast majority, which
accepts without question an always incomplete, a usually quite false, statement of the thing
because it has been repeated in the daily press and vulgarized in a hundred books.

 Here again,
as in the matter of the irrational tabus and of skepticism, two apparently contradictory things
have one root: Capitalism, and the ideal inhuman system (not realizable) called Socialism,
both spring from one type of mind and both apply to one kind of diseased society.

Against both, the pillar of reaction is peasant society, and peasant society has proved throughout
Europe largely coördinate with the remaining authority of the Catholic Church. For a peasant
society does not mean a society composed of peasants, but one in which modern Industrial Capitalism
yields to agriculture, and in which agriculture is, in the main, conducted by men possessed
in part or altogether of their instruments of production and of the soil, either through ownership
or customary tenure. In such a society all the institutions of the state repose upon an underlying
conception of secure and well-divided private property which can never be questioned and which
colors all men's minds. And that doctrine, like every other sane doctrine, though applicable
only to temporal conditions, has the firm support of the Catholic Church.

       *       *       *       *       *

So things have gone. We have reached at last, as the final result of that catastrophe three
hundred years ago, a state of society which cannot endure and a dissolution of standards, a
melting of the spiritual framework, such that the body politic fails. Men everywhere feel that
an attempt to continue down this endless and ever darkening road is like the piling up of debt.
We go further and further from a settlement. Our various forms of knowledge diverge more and
more. Authority, the very principle of life, loses its meaning, and this awful edifice of civilization
which we have inherited, and which is still our trust, trembles and threatens to crash down.
It is clearly insecure. It may fall in any moment. We who still live may see the ruin. But
ruin when it comes is not only a sudden, it is also a final, thing.
