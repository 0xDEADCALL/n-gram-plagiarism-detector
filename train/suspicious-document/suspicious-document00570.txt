William Sherman was born on the plantation of Jack Davis, about five miles from Robertsville,
South Carolina, at a place called "Black Swamp," June 12, 1842, twenty-three years prior to
Emancipation. His father who was also named William Sherman, was a free man, having bought
his freedom for eighteen hundred dollars from his master, John Jones, who also lived in the
vicinity of the Davis' plantation. William Sherman, senior, bargained with his master to obtain
his freedom, however, for he did not have the money to readily pay him. He hired himself out
to some of the wealthy plantation owners and applied what he earned toward the payment for
his freedom. He was a skilled blacksmith and cabinet maker and his services were always in
demand. After procuring his freedom he bought a tract of land from his former master and built
a home and blacksmith shop on it. As was the custom during slavery, a person who bought his
freedom had to have a guardian; Sherman's former master, John Jones, acted as his guardian.
Under this new order of things Sherman was in reality his own master. He was not "bossed,"
had his own hours, earned and kept his money, and was at liberty to leave the territory if
he desired. However, he remained and married Anna Georgia, the mother of William Sherman, junior.
She was also a slave of Jack Davis. After William Sherman, senior, finished his day's work
he would go to the Davis plantation to visit his wife and sometimes remain for the night. It
was his intention to purchase the freedom of his wife Anna Georgia, and their son William,
but he died before he had sufficient money to do so, and also before the Civil War, which he
predicted would ensue between the North and South. His son William says that he remembers well
the events that led up to his father's burial; he states that the white people dug his grave
which was six feet deep. It took them three days in which to dig it on account of the hardness
of the clay; when it was finished he was put sorrowfully away by the white folk who thought
so much of him. William was a boy of nine at that time, and he remembers that his mother was
so grieved that he tried to console her by telling her not to worry "papa's goin' to com' back
and bring us some more quails" (he had been accustomed to bringing them quails during his life)
but William sorrowingly said "he never did come back."

 She'd go out early in the day and run in ahead
of the sun and no one would know she had been out. That's how she would get ahead of the rest.

19. Do you remember what sort of soap they used? How did they get the lye for making the soap?

They made soft soap boiled in a big kettle. They made the lye out of ashes packed in an old
barrel that had a hole in the bottom. They would make a hollow in the top of the barrel and
pour rain water in it. This would gradually soak through the ashes and seep out of the bottom
of the barrel which they tipped up so that it would drain the lye out into a vessel. Then they
would take the lye and boil it in the kettle with old grease and meat rinds. The lye was very
strong. They had to be careful not to get any of it on their hands or it would take the skin
off. As they would stir the grease and lye it would foam and cook like a jelly and when it
cooled we had soft soap. It would sure chase the dirt, but it was hard on the hands.

20. What did they use for dyeing thread and cloth, and how did they dye them?

They would dig indigo roots and cook the roots and branches for blue dye. For purple they mixed
red and blue. They would pick the berries off the gallberry bushes for red. The robin's yellow
and mixed yellow and red for orange; and yellow and blue for green.

Yes. We made cedar tubs on the plantation. And we had some men who made large wooden bowls
out of juggles cut from logs of the tupla tree. They would run them through a machine and they
would come out round and then they would smooth them down. They mixed bread in those big bowls.

22. Do you remember the way they made shoes by hand in the country?

Yes.

24. Do you remember when women wore hoops in their skirts, and when they stopped wearing them
and wore narrow skirts?

Yes. The doctor's folks were so stylish that they would not let the servants wear hoops, but
we could get the old ones that they threw away and have a big time playing with them and we
would go around with them on when they were gone and couldn't see us.

25. Do you remember when you first saw your first windmill?

Never did see one.

26. Do you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?

Yes. When I was a slave, I slept in a gunny sack bunk with the sacks nailed against the wall
on two sides, in a corner of the room and then there was a post at the corner of the bed and
two poles nailed from the post to the walls and the gunny sacks were nailed to those poles.
My bed was a two-story bed. There was another gunnysack bed above me with poles fastened to
the same post. We tore old rags and made rag rugs for quilts to cover us with. I worked in
the doctor's house in the daytime but I had to sleep in the shed at night. Then after I wasn't
a slave no more, I never slept on anything else but a rope bed. When springs come I wondered
what anyone wanted wid 'em. Rope beds was good enough.

27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?

The doctor, he had the best of such things. He had a regular buggy and sometimes he driv two
horses in hit. Uncle Albert, he wuz his driver. When the doctor wanted to put on great style,
and go to the station to meet some rich company he had one of the fancy cabs with the driver
sittin' up high in front, but when he went to see his patients, he'd take his feet to go around.
He had two saddle packs with a strap that he would throw over his shoulder. He would have one
pack hanging in front and the other hanging behind.

28. Do you remember your grandparents?

No, my mother's mother was taken from her and sold when she was a baby. So I never seed my
grandmother and I don't know any more about my grandfather than a goose about a band box.

29. Do you remember the money called "shin-plasters?"

I've seen plenty. I guess my master had barrels of them.

Sherman's army went through Perry but they did not do any damage there. They expected them
to come and buried lots of food and valuable things, and when they came they took them to the
smoke houses and told them to help themselves. They did not burn any houses there.

31. Did you know any Negros who enlisted or joined the northern army?

Yes, plenty went with their boss, but ran off to Sherman's army when he came along. One woman's
husband I knowed, Mr. Bethel, he stayed with his master and didn't run off with the Northern
army. When he was given his freedom, his master give him nice house.

32. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted in the Southern Army?

About all I knew.

His two sons joined the army. James was killed, but Bud, he would never get through telling
war stories when he came back.

34. Did you live in Savannah when Sherman and the Northern forces marked through the state,
and do you remember the excitement in your town or around the plantation where you lived?

We never got sick. Sometimes they would give us oil with a drop or two of turpentine in a big
spoonful.

Yes, Jake Enos, he was a colored teacher. He was sent down to teach the colored school. He
taught around from Atlanta to Florida. He took yellow fever and died My brother, he teached
school, but I never went to school. I larned my ABC's from my massy's children. I aint never
forgot 'em. I could say 'em now.

39. How did your family's life compare after Emancipation with it before?

I had it the same. I had it good with my massy, but the rest wuz paid some little wages. Our
plantation was called a free place. Some of the slaves worked so well and made money for the
massy and gained their freedom even befo' 'mancipashun. It came to many walk could state, but we think
