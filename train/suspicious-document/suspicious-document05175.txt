189. It is difficult to describe the state of those times. James Naylor rode into Bristol,
a multitude accompanying him, strewing their scarfs, handkerchiefs, and garments on the ground
for his horse to tread on, and singing, Hosanna in the highest; holy, holy, holy is the Lord
God of Israel. He was addressed as the everlasting son of righteousness, and prince of peace.
His brain was bewildered with adulation. Women kissed his feet, and called him Jesus the Son
of God. To stop the tumult, he was apprehended, and had he been simply subjected to the discipline
of a mad-house, like Mr. Brothers of a later period, his blood would soon have recovered from
its agitation. Instead of this, a grand parade was made by trying him before a Committee of
the House of Commons, and, upon a report of the whole house, he was convicted of 'horrid blasphemy,'
and it was by the small majority of fourteen that his life was spared. His cruel sentence was
whipping, pillory, his tongue bored through with a red hot iron, a large letter B burnt into
his forehead, and to be imprisoned during the pleasure of Parliament. By his followers he was
considered a martyr; but the infatuation soon subsided. After his release, he was mercifully
restored to his senses, and became a useful Quaker.

190. These commissioners were called 'triers,' and, being high Calvinists, were nick-named
Dr. Absolute, chairman, Mr. Fatality, Mr. Fri-babe, Mr. Dam-man, Mr. Narrow-grace, Mr. Indefectible,
Mr. Dubious, and others. They turned out of their livings those clergymen who were proved to
be immoral in their conduct, and others who did not come up to the orthodox standard. Of these,
Mr. Walker, in his account of the sufferings of the clergy, gives a long list.

191. This Act or ordinance of Parliament involved some of our excellent ancestors in trouble.
Hansard Knollys, Wm. Kiffin, Mr. Lamb, and many others, were imprisoned for short periods;
Edward Barbour for eleven months. To avoid the informers, adult baptism was performed at midnight;
for this Henry Denne suffered imprisonment. That gracious and valuable minister, Vavasor Powel
also suffered a short imprisonment during the Protectorate; his life was afterwards sacrificed
by a tedious imprisonment in the following reign. He was taken, with his flock, at a midnight
meeting; and for safe custody they were locked up in the parish church, and there he preached
without molestation. When conveyed to the justice's house, while waiting his worship's leisure,
he again preached. When this magistrate arrived, he was violently enraged that his house should
have been turned into a conventicle. He would have committed them at once to prison, but two
of his daughters were so affected with the sermon, that, at their intercession, after severe
threatenings, the preacher and his friends were set at liberty.

213. It is an halcyon and the old employment of the mind, distracting one
from too mercurial study of himself, and leading him to dwell rather
of the indigestions of the elements when his own.

It, and too, has shared in these old triumphs and defeats.

Nor do i will doubt that he had a it-gentleman's in the weather-cock;
that his first question on coming down of a morning was, in Barabas's,
"into what quarter peers my familiar's bill?"

I seem to the glimpse something of this weakness in a Mr. white.



A very deeply interesting narrative of all the particulars of this examination and form of
trial, was recorded by the sufferer. See vol. i., p. 50.

221. Elstow is a perpetual curacy or vicarage, worth at that time only £35 per annum! forming
one of the discreditable anomalies of the church, in the division of its immense revenues.

222. He has favoured us with the following description of it:--'The ring is of fine gold, very
like in colour to that which has been brought into this country from California. The head is,
I think, engraven, but the letters have not that sharpness about them which indicates the engraving
tool; and the I. B. are undoubted indents made after the ring was finished.' It is not the
usual emblem of a mourning gift, for that would have the cross-bones under the skull; it was
more probably given as a special mark of esteem. Three things are certain--1st, That it so
valuable a gift excited the poor man's pride, its loss must have been a serious annoyance to
one whose family was dependent upon his daily labour. 2d, His preaching talent must have been
highly appreciated, before he was known as the author of the Pilgrim's Progress, to have brought
him so valuable a token of respect. But the most pleasing and remarkable reflection, is the
surprising progress of good-will among men of various denominations, that a ring, worn by a
despised and persecuted Nonconformist of a former age, is now highly prized and worn, from
respect to his memory, by a dignified clergyman of the Established church.

223. This was not his only ring; he left, inter alia, all his rings to his wife. See. p. lxxii.

224. After he had lain in jail five or six days, an application was made to a liberal justice
at Elstow, named Crumpton, to release him on bail; but he declined, fearing to give offence.
He, however, so felt for this persecuted servant of Christ, as to sell him an edifice and barn,
which, upon his release, was converted into a large meeting-house.

to vindicate the justices in condemning Bunyan, and grossly mis-states the facts; deeming him
to be unreasonable and intolerant; that preaching was incompatible with his calling, and that
he ought not to have sacrificed his liberty in such a cause! The poet-laureate makes these
assertions, knowing the vast benefits which sprung from the determined piety and honesty of
the persecuted preacher. Would not By-ends, Facing-both-ways, and Save-all, have jumped to
the same conclusion?

and from her to a daughter, married to Mr. Parnel, an orange merchant in Botolph Lane. He was
tempted to sell it to Mr. Bohn, the bookseller, from whom it was bought for the Bedford library.

Lord in mercy turn the hearts of his people, to seek more after the Spirit of prayer, and,
in the strength of that, to pour out their souls before the Lord.'

283. It is generally believed at Bedford, that, after Bunyan was imprisoned, his family removed
from Elstow to Bedford, in order that they might have more frequent access to him; and that,
on his release, he made his abode there. His humble dwelling was much like that of his father
at Elstow, most unassuming; just such a cottage as a poor wounded sinner would feel at home
in when visiting his pastor for advice. The late Rev. J. Geard, of Hitchin, in his Diary, says--'July
17, 1774. I preached, for the first time, at Bedford, to the successors of good Mr. Bunyan's
congregation, and the next day called at the house where he used to live, and went into the
room that tradition reported was his study. This house, though it had been the habitation of
so truly great a man, was now let for about 40s. per annum.' Allowing for the difference in
the value of money, Bunyan would have now paid 16s. a-year rent for his humble abode. After all, his claim
is only Conventicles for tithes, while the robin will bag your entire crop if he get a chance.
In the contrary, he will maintain his post on the vol, and sharply scold intruder who ventures
to steal his berries. The cottage was in the parish of St. Cuthbert, in the street
opposite the meeting-house, and here Bunyan lived, while he was pastor, from 1681 to 1688.

294. The General Doctrine of Toleration, applied to Free Communion, p. 8. George Whitefield
most warmly approved the communion of all God's saints with each other. This, I must own, more
particularly endears Mr. Bunyan to my heart. He was of a catholic spirit. The want of water
(adult baptism), with this man of God, was no bar to outward Christian communion. And I am
persuaded that if, like him, we were more deeply and experimentally baptized into the benign
and gracious influences of the blessed Spirit, we should be less baptized into the waters of
strife about circumstantials and non-essentials. For being thereby rooted and grounded in the
love of God, we should necessarily be constrained to think and let think, bear with and forbear
one another in love, and without saying, I am of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas; have but one grand,
laudable, disinterested strife, namely, who should live, preach, and exalt the ever-loving,
altogether-lovely Jesus most.

296. He hesitated as to the propriety of publishing it, probably from the influence of the
weighty opinion of Martin Luther. 'The people are greatly delighted with allegories and similitudes,
and therefore Christ oftentimes useth them; for they are, as it were, certain pictures which
set forth things as if they were painted before our eyes. Paul was a marvelous cunning workman
in handling allegories, but Origen and Jerome turn plain Scriptures into unfit and foolish
allegories. Therefore, to use allegories, it is oftentimes a very dangerous thing' [Com. on
Gal. iv. 21]. Such instructions, from one he so much venerated, curbed his exuberant imagination,
and made him doubly watchful, lest allegorizing upon subjects of such vast importance might
'darken counsel by words without knowledge.'

298. Even Dean Swift, in his popular Letter to a Young Divine, says, 'I have been better entertained,
and more informed by a few pages in the Pilgrim's Progress, than by a long discourse upon the
will and the intellect, and simple and complex ideas.' Nothing short of extraordinary merit
could have called for such a eulogy from so severe a critic.
