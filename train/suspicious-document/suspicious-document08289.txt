What is it that confers the noblest delight?  What is that which swells a man's breast with
pride above that which any other experience can bring to him?  Discovery!  To know that you
are walking where none others have walked; that you are beholding what human eye has not seen
before; that you are breathing a virgin atmosphere.  To give birth to an idea--to discover
a great thought--an intellectual nugget, right under the dust of a field that many a brain--plow
had gone over before.  To find a new planet, to invent a new hinge, to find the way to make
the lightnings carry your messages.  To be the first--that is the idea.  To do something, say
something, see something, before any body else--these are the things that confer a pleasure
compared with which other pleasures are tame and commonplace, other ecstasies cheap and trivial.
Morse, with his first message, brought by his servant, the lightning; Fulton, in that long-drawn
century of suspense, when he placed his hand upon the throttle-valve and lo, the steamboat
moved; Jenner, when his patient with the cow's virus in his blood, walked through the smallpox
hospitals unscathed; Howe, when the idea shot through his brain that for a hundred and twenty
generations the eye had been bored through the wrong end of the needle; the nameless lord of
art who laid down his chisel in some old age that is forgotten, now, and gloated upon the finished
Laocoon; Daguerre, when he commanded the sun, riding in the zenith, to print the landscape
upon his insignificant silvered plate, and he obeyed; Columbus, in the Pinta's shrouds, when
he swung his hat above a fabled sea and gazed abroad upon an unknown world!  These are the
men who have really lived--who have actually comprehended what pleasure is--who have crowded
long lifetimes of ecstasy into a single moment.

What is there in Rome for me to see that others have not seen before me? What is there for
me to touch that others have not touched?  What is there for me to feel, to learn, to hear,
to know, that shall thrill me before it pass to others?  What can I discover?--Nothing.  Nothing
whatsoever.  One charm of travel dies here.  But if I were only a Roman! --If, added to my
own I could be gifted with modern Roman sloth, modern Roman superstition, and modern Roman
boundlessness of ignorance, what bewildering worlds of unsuspected wonders I would discover!
Ah, if I were only a habitant of the Campagna five and twenty miles from Rome! Then I would travel.

I would go to America, and see, and learn, and return to the Campagna and stand before my countrymen
an illustrious discoverer.  I would say:

"I saw there a country which has no overshadowing Mother Church, and yet the people survive.
I saw a government which never was protected by foreign soldiers at a cost greater than that
required to carry on the government itself.  I saw common men and common women who could read;
I even saw small children of common country people reading from books; if I dared think you
would believe it, I would say they could write, also.

"In the cities I saw people drinking a delicious beverage made of chalk and water, but never
once saw goats driven through their Broadway or their Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery
street and milked at the doors of the houses.  I saw real glass windows in the houses of even
the commonest people.  Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet of bricks; I solemnly swear
they are made of wood.  Houses there will take fire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely
down, and not leave a single vestige behind.  I could state that for a truth, upon my death-bed.
And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I aver that they have a thing which they
call a fire-engine, which vomits forth great streams of water, and is kept always in readiness,
by night and by day, to rush to houses that are burning.  You would think one engine would
be sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep men hired, and pay them by the
month to do nothing but put out fires.  For a certain sum of money other men will insure that
your house shall not burn down; and if it burns they will pay you for it.  There are hundreds
and thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, like a priest.  In that
singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is damned; he can not buy salvation with money
for masses.  There is really not much use in being rich, there.  Not much use as far as the
other world is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; because there, if a man
be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become a legislator, a governor, a general, a
senator, no matter how ignorant an ass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold
all the great places, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots.  There, if a man be
rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, they invite him to drink complicated
beverages; but if he be poor and in debt, they require him to do that which they term to "settle."
The women put on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usually fine, but absurd
in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changes twice in a hundred years; and did I but
covet to be called an extravagant falsifier, I would say it changed even oftener.  Hair does

In America we make convicts useful at the same time that we punish them for their crimes. 
We farm them out and compel them to earn money for the State by making barrels and building
roads.  Thus we combine business with retribution, and all things are lovely.  But in ancient
Rome they combined religious duty with pleasure.  Since it was necessary that the new sect
called Christians should be exterminated, the people judged it wise to make this work profitable
to the State at the same time, and entertaining to the public.  In addition to the gladiatorial
combats and other shows, they sometimes threw members of the hated sect into the arena of the
Coliseum and turned wild beasts in upon them.  It is estimated that seventy thousand Christians
suffered martyrdom in this place.  This has made the Coliseum holy ground, in the eyes of the
followers of the Saviour.  And well it might; for if the chain that bound a saint, and the
footprints a saint has left upon a stone he chanced to stand upon, be holy, surely the spot
where a man gave up his life for his faith is holy.

Glad was the contraband that had a seat in the pit at the Saturday matinee, and happy the Roman

For me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish of the ruined Coliseum
the only playbill of that establishment now extant. There was a suggestive smell of mint-drops
about it still, a corner of it had evidently been chewed, and on the margin, in choice Latin,
these words were written in a delicate female hand:
