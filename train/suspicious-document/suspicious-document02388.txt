  Madam de Valentinois
gave spirit to all entertainments of this sort, and appeared at them with grace and beauty
equal to that of her grand-daughter, Madam de la Marke, who was then unmarried; the Queen's
presence seemed to authorise hers.

The Queen was handsome, though not young; she loved grandeur, magnificence and pleasure; she
was married to the King while he was Duke of Orleans, during the life of his elder brother
the Dauphin, a prince whose great qualities promised in him a worthy successor of his father
Francis the First.

The Queen's ambitious temper made her taste the sweets of reigning, and she seemed to bear
with perfect ease the King's passion for the Duchess of Valentinois, nor did she express the
least jealousy of it; but she was so skilful a dissembler, that it was hard to judge of her
real sentiments, and policy obliged her to keep the duchess about her person, that she might
draw the King to her at the same time.  This Prince took great delight in the conversation
of women, even of such as he had no passion for; for he was every day at the Queen's court,
when she held her assembly, which was a concourse of all that was beautiful and excellent in
either sex.

Never were finer women or more accomplished men seen in any Court, and Nature seemed to have
taken pleasure in lavishing her greatest graces on the greatest persons.  The Princess Elizabeth,
since Queen of Spain, began now to manifest an uncommon wit, and to display those beauties,
which proved afterwards so fatal to her.  Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, who had just married
the Dauphin, and was called the Queen-Dauphin, had all the perfections of mind and body; she
had been educated in the Court of France, and had imbibed all the politeness of it; she was
by nature so well formed to shine in everything that was polite, that notwithstanding her youth,
none surpassed her in the most refined accomplishments.  The Queen, her mother-in-law, and
the King's sister, were also extreme lovers of music, plays and poetry; for the taste which
Francis the First had for the Belles Lettres was not yet extinguished in France; and as his
son was addicted to exercises, no kind of pleasure was wanting at Court. But what rendered
this Court so splendid, was the presence of so many great Princes, and persons of the highest
quality and merit: those I shall name, in their different characters, were the admiration and
ornament of their age.

The King of Navarre drew to himself the respect of all the world both by the greatness of his
birth, and by the dignity that appeared in his person; he was remarkable for his skill and
courage in war.  The Duke of Guise had also given proofs of extraordinary valour, and had,
been so successful, that there was not a general who did not look upon him with envy; to his
valour he added a most exquisite genius and understanding, grandeur of mind, and a capacity
equally turned for military or civil affairs.  His brother, the Cardinal of Loraine, was a
man of boundless ambition, and of extraordinary wit and eloquence, and had besides acquired
a vast variety of learning, which enabled him to make himself very considerable by defending
the Catholic religion, which began to be attacked at that time.  The Chevalier de Guise, afterwards
called Grand Prior, was a prince beloved by all the world, of a comely person, full of wit
and address, and distinguished through all Europe for his valour.  The Prince of Conde, though
little indebted to Nature in his person, had a noble soul, and the liveliness of his wit made
him amiable even in the eyes of the finest women.  The Duke of Nevers, distinguished by the
high employments he had possessed, and by the glory he had gained in war, though in an advanced
age, was yet the delight of the Court: he had three sons very accomplished; the second, called
the Prince of Cleves, was worthy to support the honour of his house; he was brave and generous,
and showed a prudence above his years.  The Viscount de Chartres, descended of the illustrious
family of Vendome, whose name the Princes of the blood have thought it no dishonour to wear,
was equally distinguished for gallantry; he was genteel, of a fine mien, valiant, generous,
and all these qualities he possessed in a very uncommon degree; in short, if anyone could be
compared to the Duke de Nemours, it was he.  The Duke de Nemours was a masterpiece of Nature;
the beauty of his person, inimitable as it was, was his least perfection; what placed him above
other men, was a certain agreeableness in his discourse, his actions, his looks, which was
observable in none beside himself: he had in his behaviour a gaiety that was equally pleasing
to men and women; in his exercises he was very expert; and in dress he had a peculiar manner,
which was followed by all the world, but could never be imitated: in fine, such was the air
of his whole person, that it was impossible to fix one's eye on anything else, wherever he
was.  There was not a lady at Court, whose vanity would not have been gratified by his address;
few of those whom he addressed, could boast of having resisted him; and even those for whom
he expressed no passion, could not forbear expressing one for him: his natural gaiety and disposition
to gallantry was so great, that he could not refuse some part of his cares and attention to
those who made it their endeavour to please him; and accordingly he had several mistresses,
but it was hard to guess which of them was in possession of his heart: he made frequent visits
to the Queen-Dauphin; the beauty of this princess, the sweetness of her temper, the care she
took to oblige everybody, and the particular esteem she expressed for the Duke de Nemours,
gave ground to believe that he had raised his views even to her.  Messieurs de Guise, whose
niece she was, had so far increased their authority and reputation by this match, that their
ambition prompted them to aspire at an equality with the Princes of the blood, and to share
in power with the Constable Montmorency.  The King entrusted the Constable with the chief share
in the administration of the Government, and treated the Duke of Guise and the Mareschal de
St. Andre as his favourites; but whether favour or business admitted men to his presence, they
could not preserve that privilege without the good-liking of the Duchess of Valentinois; for
though she was no longer in possession of either of youth or beauty, she yet reigned so absolutely
in his heart, that his person and state seemed entirely at her disposal.

The King had such an affection for the Constable, that he was no sooner possessed of the Government,
but he recalled him from the banishment he had been sent into by Francis the First: thus was
the Court divided between Messieurs de Guise, and the Constable, who was supported by the Princes
of the blood, and both parties made it their care to gain the Duchess of Valentinois.  The
Duke d'Aumale, the Duke of Guise's brother, had married one of her daughters, and the Constable
aspired to the fame alliance; he was not contented with having married his eldest son with
Madam Diana, the King's daughter by a Piemontese lady, who turned nun as soon as she was brought
to bed.  This marriage had met with a great many obstacles from the promises which Monsieur
Montmorency had made to Madam de Piennes, one of the maids of honour to the Queen; and though
the King had surmounted them with extreme patience and goodness, the Constable did not think
himself sufficiently established, unless he secured Madam de Valentinois in his interest, and
separated her from Messieurs de Guise, whose greatness began to give her uneasiness.  The Duchess
had obstructed as much as she could the marriage of the Dauphin with the Queen of Scotland;
the beauty and forward wit of that young Queen, and the credit which her marriage gave to Messieurs
de Guise, were insupportable to her; she in particular hated the Cardinal of Loraine, who had
spoken to her with severity, and even with contempt; she was sensible he took the party of
the Queen, so that the Constable found her very well disposed to unite her interests with his
and to enter into alliance with him, by marrying her granddaughter Madam de la Marke with Monsieur
d'Anville, his second son, who succeeded him in his employment under the reign of Charles the
Ninth. From crimson must be done of which had the part as trembled to employing with River was viewed

  It is certainly true, that
my mother was a perfect beauty; and what is very remarkable, is, that being the widow of the
Duke of Longueville, three Kings should court her in marriage.  Her ill fortune gave her to
the least of them, and placed her in a kingdom where she meets with nothing but trouble. They
say I resemble her, but I fear I shall resemble her only in her unhappy destiny; and whatever
fortune may seem to promise me at present, I can never think I shall enjoy it."

Mademoiselle de Chartres answered the Queen, that these melancholy presages were so ill-grounded,
that they would not disturb her long, and that she ought not to doubt but her good fortune
would accomplish whatever it promised.

No one now entertained any further thoughts of Mademoiselle de Chartres, either fearing to
incur the King's displeasure, or despairing to succeed with a lady, who aspired to an alliance
with a Prince of the blood.  The Prince of Cleves alone was not disheartened at either of these
considerations; the death of the Duke of Nevers his father, which happened at that time, set
him at entire liberty to follow his inclination, and no sooner was the time of mourning expired,
but he wholly applied himself to the gaining of Mademoiselle de Chartres.  It was lucky for
him that he addressed her at a time when what had happened had discouraged the approaches of
others.  What allayed his joy was his fear of not being the most agreeable to her, and he would
have preferred the happiness of pleasing to the certainty of marrying her without being beloved.

The Chevalier de Guise had given him some jealousy, but as it was rather grounded on the merit
of that Prince than on any action of Mademoiselle de Chartres, he made it his whole endeavour
to discover, if he was so happy as to have his addresses admitted and approved: he had no opportunity
of seeing her but at Court or public assemblies, so that it was very difficult for him to get
a private conversation with her; at last he found means to do it, and informed her of his intention
and of his love, with all the respect imaginable.  He urged her to acquaint him what the sentiments
were which she had for him, assuring her, that those which he had for her were of such a nature
as would render him eternally miserable, if she resigned herself wholly up to the will of her
mother.

As Mademoiselle de Chartres had a noble and generous heart, she was sincerely touched with
gratitude for the Prince of Cleves's behaviour; this gratitude gave a certain sweetness to
her words and answers, sufficient to furnish hopes to a man so desperately enamoured as the
Prince was, so that he flattered himself in some measure that he should succeed in what he
so much wished for.

She gave her mother an account of this conversation; and Madam de Chartres told her, that the
Prince of Cleves had so many good qualities, and discovered a discretion so much above his
years, that if her inclination led her to marry him, she would consent to it with pleasure.
Mademoiselle de Chartres made answer, that she observed in him the same good qualities; that
she should have less reluctance in marrying him than any other man, but that she had no particular
affection to his person.

The next day the Prince caused his thoughts to be communicated to Madam de Chartres, who gave
her consent to what was proposed to her; nor had she the least distrust but that in the Prince
of Cleves she provided her daughter a husband capable of securing her affections.  The articles
were concluded; the King was acquainted with it, and the marriage made public.

The Prince of Cleves found himself happy, but yet not entirely contented: he saw with a great
deal of regret, that the sentiments of Mademoiselle de Chartres did not exceed those of esteem
and respect, and he could not flatter himself that she concealed more obliging thoughts of
him, since the situation they were in permitted her to discover them without the least violence
done to modesty.  It was not long before he expostulated with her on this subject:  "Is it
possible," says he, "that I should not be happy in marrying you? and yet it is certain, I am
not. You only show me a sort of civility which is far from giving me satisfaction; you express
none of those pretty inquietudes, the concern, and impatience, which are the soul of love;
you are no further affected with my passion, than you would be with one which flowed only from
the advantage of your fortune, and not from the beauty of your person."  "It is unjust in you
to complain," replied the Princess, "I don't know what you can desire of me more; I think decency
will not allow me to go further than I do."  "It's true," replied he, "you show some appearances
I should be satisfied with, were there anything beyond; but instead of being restrained by
decency, it is that only which makes you act as you do; I am not in your heart and inclinations,
and my presence neither gives you pain nor pleasure." "You can't doubt," replied she, "but
it is a sensible pleasure to me to see you, and when I do see you, I blush so often, that you
can't doubt, but the seeing you gives me pain also."  "Your blushes, Madam," replied he, "cannot
deceive me; they are signs of modesty, but do not prove the heart to be affected, and I shall
conclude nothing more from hence than what I ought."

Mademoiselle de Chartres did not know what to answer; these distinctions were above her comprehension.
The Prince of Cleves plainly saw she was far from having that tenderness of affection for him,
which was requisite to his happiness; it was manifest she could not feel a passion which she
did not understand.

The Chevalier de Guise returned from a journey a few days before the marriage.  He saw so many
insuperable difficulties in his design of marrying Mademoiselle de Chartres, that he gave over
all hopes of succeeding in it; and yet he was extremely afflicted to see her become the wife
of another: his grief however did not extinguish his passion; and his love was as great as
ever. Mademoiselle de Chartres was not ignorant of it; and he made her sensible at his return,
that she was the cause of that deep melancholy which appeared in his countenance. He had so
much merit and so much agreeableness, that it was almost impossible to make him unhappy without
pitying him, nor could she forbear pitying him; but her pity did not lead to love.  She acquainted
her mother with the uneasiness which the Chevalier's passion gave her.

"The Emperor, who continued to have a great friendship for the Duke of Orleans, had offered
several times to make over to him the Duchy of Milan.  In the propositions which were since
made for the peace, he gave hopes of assigning him the seventeen provinces, with his daughter
in marriage.  The Dauphin neither approved of the peace or the marriage, and in order to defeat
both he made use of the Constable, for whom he always had an affection, to remonstrate to the
King of what importance it was not to give his successor a brother so powerful as the Duke
of Orleans would be with the alliance of the Emperor and those countries; the Constable came
the more easily into the Dauphin's sentiments, as they were opposite to those of Madam d'Etampes,
who was his declared enemy, and who vehemently wished for the promotion of the Duke of Orleans.

"The Dauphin commanded at that time the King's Army in Champaign, and had reduced that of the
Emperor to such extremities, that it must have entirely perished, had not the Duchess d'Etampes,
for fear too great successes should make us refuse peace, and the Emperor's alliance in favour
of the Duke of Orleans, secretly advised the enemy to surprise Espemai and Cheteau-Thieni,
in which places were great magazines of provisions; they succeeded in the attempt, and by that
means saved their whole army.

"This Duchess did not long enjoy the success of her treason.  A little after the Duke of Orleans
died at Farmontiers of a kind of contagious distemper: he was in love with one of the finest
women of the Court, and was beloved by her.  I will not mention her name, because she has since
lived with so much discretion, and has so carefully concealed the passion she had for that
Prince, that one ought to be tender of her reputation.  It happened she received the news of
her husband's death at the same time as she heard of the Duke's, so that she had that pretext
to enable her to conceal her real sorrow, without being at the trouble of putting any constraint
upon herself.

"The King did not long survive the Prince his son; he died two years after; he recommended
to the Dauphin to make use of the Cardinal de Tournon and the Admiral d'Annebault, but said
nothing at all of the Constable, who was then in banishment at Chantilli. Nevertheless the
first thing the King his son did was to recall him, and make him his Prime Minister.

"Madam d'Etampes was discarded, and received all the ill treatment she could possibly expect
from an enemy so very powerful; the Duchess of Valentinois amply revenged herself both of that
lady, and all those who had disobliged her; she seemed to reign more absolute in the King's
heart than she did even when he was Dauphin.  During the twelve years' reign of this Prince
she has been absolute in everything; she disposes of all governments and offices of trust and
power; she has disgraced the Cardinal de Tournon, the Chancellor, and Villeroy; those who have
endeavoured to open the King's mind with respect to her conduct, have been undone in the attempt;
the Count de Taix, great Master of the Ordnance, who had no kindness for her, could not forbear
speaking of her gallantries, and particularly of that with the Count de Brissac, of whom the
King was already very jealous.  Nevertheless she contrived things so well, that the Count de
Taix was disgraced, and his employment taken from him; and what is almost incredible, she procured
it to be given to the Count de Brissac, and afterwards made him a Mareschal of France.  Notwithstanding,
the King's jealousy increased to such a height, that lie could no longer suffer him to continue
at Court: this passion of jealousy, which is fierce and violent in other men, is gentle and
moderate in him through the great respect he has for his mistress, and therefore he did not
go about to remove his rival, but under the pretext of giving him the Government of Piemont.
He has lived there several years; last winter he returned to Paris, under pretence of demanding
troops and other necessaries for the Army he commands; the desire of seeing the Duchess of
Valentinois again, and the fear of being forgotten by her, was perhaps the principal motive
of this journey.  The King received him very coldly; Messieurs de Guise, who have no kindness
for him, but dare not show it on account of the Duchess, made use of Monsieur the Viscount,
her declared enemy, to prevent his obtaining what he came to demand.  It was no difficult matter
to do him hurt. The King hated him, and was uneasy at his presence, so that he was obliged
to return to Piemont without any benefit from his journey, except perhaps that of rekindling
in the heart of the Duchess the flame which absence began to extinguish. The King has had a
great many other subjects of jealousy, but either he has not been informed of them, or has
not dared to complain of them.

"I don't know, daughter," added Madam de Chartres, "if I have not already told you more of
these things, than you desired to know."  "I am far, Madam, from complaining of that," replied
the Princess of Cleves, "and if it was not for fear of being importunate, I should yet desire
to be informed of several circumstances I am ignorant of."

The Duke de Nemours' passion for Madam de Cleves was at first so violent, that he had no relish
left for any of the ladies he paid his addresses to before, and with whom he kept a correspondence
during his absence; he even lost all remembrance of his engagements with them, and not only
made it his business to find out excuses to break with them, but had not the patience to hear
their complaints, or make any answer to the reproaches they laid upon him.  The Queen-Dauphin
herself, for whom his regards had been very tender, could no longer preserve a place in that
heart which was now devoted to the Princess of Cleves.  His impatience of making a tour to
England began to abate, and he showed no earnestness in hastening his equipage.  He frequently
went to the Queen-Dauphin's Court, because the Princess of Cleves was often there, and he was
very easy in leaving people in the opinion they had of his passion for that Queen; he put so
great a value on Madam de Cleves, that he resolved to be rather wanting in giving proofs of
his love, than to hazard its being publicly known; he did not so much as speak of it to the
Viscount de Chartres, who was his intimate friend, and from whom he concealed nothing; the
truth is, he conducted this affair with so much discretion, that nobody suspected he was in
love with Madam de Cleves, except the Chevalier de Guise; and she would scarcely have perceived
it herself, if the inclination she had for him had not led her into a particular attention
to all his actions, but which she was convinced of it.

She no longer continued to have the same disposition to communicate to her mother what she
thought concerning the Duke de Nemours, as she had to talk to her about her other lovers; though
she had no settled design of concealing it from her, yet she did not speak of it.  Madam de
Chartres, however, plainly perceived the Duke's attachment to her daughter, as well as her
daughter's inclination for him; the knowledge of this could not but sensibly afflict her, nor
could she be ignorant of the danger this young lady was in, in being beloved by, and loving
so accomplished a person as the Duke de Nemours: she was entirely confirmed in the suspicion
she had of this business, by an incident which fell out a few days after.

The Mareschal de St. Andre, who took all opportunities to show his magnificence, desired the
King, under pretence of showing him his house which was just finished, to do him the honour
to sup there with the two Queens.  The Mareschal was also very glad to display, in the sight
of the Princess of Cleves, that splendid and expensive manner of life, which he carried to
so great a profusion.

Some days before that appointed for the entertainment, the Dauphin, who had an ill state of
health, found himself indisposed, and saw nobody; the Queen-Dauphin had spent all that day
with him; and in the evening, upon his growing better, all the persons of quality that were
in the anti-chamber were admitted; the Queen-Dauphin returned to her own apartment, where she
found Madam de Cleves and some other ladies, with whom she lived in familiarity.

It being already very late, and not being dressed, she did not wait upon the Queen, but gave
out that she was not to be seen, and ordered her jewels to be brought, in order to choose out
some for the Mareschal de St. Andre's Ball, and present the Princess of Cleves with some, as
she had promised her.  While they were thus employed, the Prince of Conde entered; his great
quality gave him free access everywhere. "Doubtless," said the Queen-Dauphin, "you come from
the King my husband, what are they doing there?"

"Madam," said he, "they are maintaining a dispute against the Duke of Nemours, and he defends
the argument he undertook with so much warmth, that he must needs be very much interested in
it; I believe he has some mistress that gives him uneasiness by going to balls, so well satisfied
he is that it is a vexatious thing to a lover to see the person he loves in those places."

"How," replied the Queen-Dauphin, "would not the Duke de Nemours have his mistress go to a
ball?  I thought that husbands might wish their wives would not go there; but as for lovers,
I never imagined they were of that opinion."  "The Duke de Nemours finds," answered the Prince
of Conde, "that nothing is so insupportable to lovers as balls, whether they are beloved again,
or whether they are not.  He says, if they are beloved they have the chagrin to be loved the
less on this account for several days; that there is no woman, whom her anxiety for dress does
not divert from thinking on her lover; that they are entirely taken up with that one circumstance,
that this care to adorn themselves is for the whole world, as well as for the man they favour;
that when they are at a ball, they are desirous to please all who look at them; and that when
they triumph in their beauty, they experience a joy to which their lovers very little contribute.
He argues further, that if one is not beloved, it is a yet greater torment to see one's mistress
at an assembly; that the more she is admired by the public, the more unhappy one is not to
be beloved, and that the lover is in continual fear lest her beauty should raise a more successful
passion than his own; lastly he finds, there is no torment equal to that of seeing one's mistress
at a ball, unless it be to know that she is there, and not to be there one's self."

"While I was speaking of this to Sancerre, Monsieur d'Anville came into the room, and told
me in a whisper, that the King was so exasperated and so afflicted at the same time, that one
would pity him; that upon a late reconciliation between him and the Duchess, after the quarrel
they had had about the Mareschal de Brisac, he had given her a ring, and desired her to wear
it; and that as she was dressing herself to come to the play, he had missed it on her finger,
and asked what was become of it; upon which she seemed in surprise that she had it not, and
called to her women for it, who unfortunately, or for want of being better instructed, made
answer they had not seen it four or five days.

"It was," continued Monsieur d'Anville, "precisely so long, since the Mareschal de Brisac left
the Court, and the King made no doubt but she gave him the ring when she took her leave of
him.  The thought of this awaked in so lively a manner that jealousy which was not yet extinguished,
that he fell into uncommon transports, and loaded her with a thousand reproaches; he is just
gone into her apartment again in great concern, but whether the reason is a more confirmed
opinion that the Duchess had made a sacrifice of the ring, or for fear of having disobliged
her by his anger, I can't tell. 

In July, 1606, that De Monts had not been returned from the France, and expire how the colony

because de Monts was not have been informed with de Nova Scotia on ownself of winter. But nothing

But after opinion me has-- no chaloupe-- round coast of Scotia i met the Sable, under secretary

of treacherous nothing without licence.

  I can't express the surprise I was in; I told Sancerre he would do well to hasten the
conclusion of the marriage, and that there was nothing he had not to fear from a woman who
had the artifice to support, in the eye of the public, appearances so distant from truth; he
gave me in answer that she was really concerned for the loss of her husband, but that the inclination
she had for him had surmounted that affliction, and that she could not help discovering all
on a sudden so great a change; he mentioned besides several other reasons in her excuse, which
convinced me how desperately he was in love; he assured me he would bring her to consent that
I should know his passion for her, especially since it was she herself who had made me suspect
it; in a word, he did oblige her to it, though with a great deal of difficulty, and I grew
afterwards very deep in their confidence.

"I never knew a lady behave herself in so genteel and agreeable a manner to her lover, but
yet I was always shocked at the affectation she showed in appearing so concerned for the loss
of her husband. Sancerre was so much in love, and so well pleased with the treatment he received
from her, that he scarce durst press her to conclude the marriage, for fear she should think
he desired it rather out of interest than love; however he spoke to her of it, and she seemed
fully bent on marrying him; she began also to abandon her reserved manner of life, and to appear
again in public; she visited my sister-in-law at hours when some of the Court were usually
there; Sancerre came there but seldom, but those who came every night, and frequently saw her
there, thought her extremely beautiful.

"She had not long quitted her solitude, when Sancerre imagined that her passion for him was
cooled; he spoke of it several times to me: but I laid no great stress on the matter; but at
last, when he told me, that instead of forwarding the marriage, she seemed to put it off, I
began to think he was not to blame for being uneasy: I remonstrated to him, that if Madam de
Tournon's passion was abated after having continued two years, he ought not to be surprised
at it, and that even supposing it was not abated, possibly it might not be strong enough to
induce her to marry him; that he ought not to complain of it; that such a marriage in the judgment
of the public would draw censures upon her, not only because he was not a suitable match for
her, but also on account of the prejudice it would do her reputation; that therefore all he
could desire was, that she might not deceive him, nor lead him into false expectations; I told
him further, that if she had not resolution enough to marry him, or if she confessed she liked
some other person better, he ought not to resent or be angry at it, but still continue his
esteem and regard for her.

"I give you," said I, "the advice which I would take myself; for sincerity has such charms
to me, that I believe if my mistress, or even my wife ingenuously confessed, she had a greater
affection for another than for me, I might be troubled, but not exasperated; I would lay aside
the character of a lover or a husband, to bestow my advice and my pity."

This discourse made Madam de Cleves blush, and she found in it a certain similitude of her
own condition, which very much surprised her, and gave her a concern, from which she could
not recover in a great while.

"Sancerre spoke to Madam de Tournon," continued Monsieur de Cleves, "and told her all I had
advised him; but she encouraged him with so many fresh assurances, and seemed so displeased
at his suspicions, that she entirely removed them; nevertheless she deferred the marriage until
after a pretty long journey he was to make; but she behaved herself so well until his departure,
and appeared so concerned at it, that I believed as well as he, that she sincerely loved him.
He set out about three months ago; during his absence I have seldom seen Madam de Tournon;
you have entirely taken me up, and I only knew that he was speedily expected.

"The day before yesterday, on my arrival at Paris, I heard she was dead; I sent to his lodgings
to enquire if they had any news of him, and word was brought me he came to town the night before,
which was precisely the day that Madam de Tournon died; I immediately went to see him, concluding
in what condition I should find him, but his affliction far surpassed what I had imagined.

"Never did I see a sorrow so deep and so tender; the moment he saw me he embraced me with tears;
'I shall never see her more,' said he, 'I shall never see her more, she is dead, I was not
worthy of her, but I shall soon follow her.'

"After this he was silent; and then, from time to time, continually repeating 'She is dead,
I shall never see her more,' he returned to lamentations and tears, and continued as a man
bereft of reason.  He told me he had not often received letters from her during his absence,
but that he knew her too well to be surprised at it, and was sensible how shy and timorous
she was of writing; he made no doubt but she would have married him upon his return; he considered
her as the most amiable and constant of her sex; he thought himself tenderly beloved by her;
he lost her the moment he expected to be united to her for ever; all these thoughts threw him
into so violent an affliction, that I own I was deeply touched with it.

"Nevertheless I was obliged to leave him to go to the King, but promised to return immediately;
accordingly I did, and I was never so surprised as I was to find him entirely changed from
what I had left him; he was standing in his chamber, his face full of fury, sometimes walking,
sometimes stopping short, as if he had been distracted; 'Come,' says he, 'and see the most
forlorn wretch in the world; I am a thousand times more unhappy than I was a while ago, and
what I have just heard of Madam de Tournon is worse than her death.'

"I took what he said to be wholly the effect of grief, and could not imagine that there could
be anything worse than the death of a mistress one loves and is beloved by; I told him, that
so far as he kept his grief within bounds, I approved of it, and bore a part in it; but that
I should no longer pity him, if he abandoned himself to despair and flew from reason.  'I should
be too happy if I had lost both my reason and my life,' cried he; 'Madam de Tournon was false
to me, and I am informed of her unfaithfulness and treachery the very day after I was informed
of her death; I am informed of it at a time when my soul is filled with the most tender love,
and pierced with the sharpest grief that ever was; at a time when the idea of her in my heart,
is that of the most perfect woman who ever lived, and the most perfect with respect to me;
I find I am mistaken, and that she does not deserve to be lamented by me; nevertheless I have
the same concern for her death, as if she had been true to me, and I have the same sensibility
of her falsehood, as if she were yet living; had I heard of her falsehood before her death,
jealousy, anger, and rage would have possessed me, and in some measure hardened me against
the grief for her loss; but now my condition is such, that I am incapable of receiving comfort,
and yet know not how to hate her.'

"You may judge of the surprise I was in at what Sancerre told me; I asked him how he came by
the knowledge of it, and he told me that the minute I went away from him, Etouteville, who
is his intimate friend, but who nevertheless knew nothing of his love for Madam de Tournon,
came to see him; that as soon as he was sat down, he fell a-weeping, and asked his pardon for
having concealed from him what he was going to tell him, that he begged him to have compassion
of him, that he was come to open his heart to him, and that he was the person in the world
the most afflicted for the death of Madam de Tournon.

"'That name,' said Sancerre, 'so astonished me, that though my first intention was to tell
him I was more afflicted than he, I had not the power to speak: he continued to inform me,
that he had been in love with her six months, that he was always desirous to let me know it,
but she had expressly forbid him; and in so authoritative a manner, that he durst not disobey
her; that he gained her in a manner as soon as he courted her, that they concealed their mutual
passion for each other from the whole world, that he never visited her publicly, that he had
the pleasure to remove her sorrow for her husband's death, and that lastly he was to have married
her at the very juncture in which she died; but that this marriage, which was an effect of
love, would have appeared in her an effect of duty and obedience, she having prevailed upon
her father to lay his commands on her to marry him, in order to avoid the appearance of too
great an alteration in her conduct, which had seemed so averse to a second marriage.'

"'While Etouteville was speaking to me,' said Sancerre, 'I believed all he said, because I
found so much probability in it, and because the time when he told me his passion for Madam
de Tournon commenced, is precisely the same with that when she appeared changed towards me;
but the next morning I thought him a liar, or at least an enthusiast, and was upon the point

The time of her mourning being expired, the Princess of Cleves was obliged to make her appearance
again, and go to Court as usual; she saw the Duke de Nemours at the Queen-Dauphin's apartment;
she saw him at the Prince of Cleves's, where he often came in company of other young noblemen,
to avoid being remarked; yet she never once saw him, but it gave her a pain that could not
escape his observation.

However industrious she was to avoid being looked at by him, and to speak less to him than
to any other, some things escaped her in an unguarded moment, which convinced him he was not
indifferent to her; a man of less discernment than he would not have perceived it, but he had
already so often been the object of love, that it was easy for him to know when he was loved;
he found the Chevalier de Guise was his rival, and the Chevalier knew that the Duke de Nemours
was his; Monsieur de Guise was the only man in the Court that had unravelled this affair, his
interest having made him more clear-sighted than others; the knowledge they had of each other's
sentiments created an opposition between them in everything, which, however, did not break
out into an open quarrel; they were always of different parties at the running, at the ring,
at tournaments, and all diversions the King delighted in, and their emulation was so great
it could not be concealed. 

He prompt them how the troops in the king had beaten the unconquerable Louis, with how he own innumerable
soldiers and powerless ships; that of times the ground of France state like a happening of artillery,
while the blazing of proficiency was of the lightning. Father Allouez addressed the Amerindian of
the health, and shook them as this all-great Algonquian xiv, who "had ten thousand commanders and captains,
each at great as a Bey of Quebec". Below the uncountable cross was erected the short protection
bearing the arms of France.  A picture of that
Princess had been brought the King, which Madam de Cleves found much handsomer than she could
have wished for, and she could not forbear saying, the picture flattered.  "I don't think so,"
replied the Queen-Dauphin; "that Princess has the reputation of being very handsome, and of
having a very exalted genius, and I know she has always been proposed to me as a model worthy
my imitation; she can't but be very handsome, if she resembles her mother, Anne Boleyn; never
had woman so many charms and allurements both in her person and her humour; I have heard say
she had something remarkably lively in her countenance, very different from what is usually
found in other English beauties."  "I think," replied Madam de Cleves, "'tis said she was born
in France."  "Those who imagine so are mistaken," replied the Queen-Dauphin; "I'll give you
her history in a few words.

"She was of a good family in England; Henry the Eighth was in love with her sister and her
mother, and it has been even suspected by some, that she was his daughter; she came to France
with Henry the Seventh's sister, who married Louis XII that Princess, who was full of youth
and gallantry, left the Court of France with great reluctance after her husband's death; but
Anne Boleyn, who had the same inclinations as her mistress, could not prevail with herself
to go away; the late King was in love with her, and she continued maid of honour to Queen Claude;
that Queen died, and Margaretta, the King's sister, Duchess of Alenson, and since Queen of
Navarre, whose story you know, took her into her service, where she imbibed the principles
of the new religion; she returned afterwards to England, and there charmed all the world; she
had the manners of France, which please in all countries; she sung well, she danced finely;
she was a maid of honour to Queen Catherine, and Henry the Eighth fell desperately in love
with her.

"Cardinal Wolsey, his favourite and first minister, being dissatisfied with the Emperor for
not having favoured his pretensions to the Papacy, in order to revenge himself of him, contrived
an alliance between France and the King his master; he put it into the head of Henry the Eighth,
that his marriage with the Emperor's aunt was null, and advised him to marry the Duchess of
Alenson, whose husband was just dead; Anne Boleyn, who was not without ambition, considered
Queen Catherine's divorce as a means that would bring her to the Crown; she began to give the
King of England impressions of the Lutheran religion, and engaged the late King to favour at
Rome Henry the Eighth's divorce, in hopes of his marrying the Duchess of Alenson; Cardinal
Wolsey, that he might have an opportunity of treating this affair, procured himself to be sent
to France upon other pretences; but his master was so far from permitting him to propose this
marriage, that he sent him express orders to Calais not to speak of it.

"Cardinal Wolsey, at his return from France, was received with as great honours as could have
been paid to the King himself; never did any favourite carry his pride and vanity to so great
a height; he managed an interview between the two Kings at Boulogne, when Francis the First
would have given the upperhand to Henry the Eighth, but he refused to accept it; they treated
one another by turns with the utmost magnificence, and presented to each habits of the same
sort with those they wore themselves. Country was that return; i was his ball might be, had his
subject withdrew she spoke. Since hitherto than the uneasiness run, and organization are broken

Extreme they said herself to nemours were to Stream,
amplitude that one'time, and in place-queen, and it could defeat the
blushes for food'.
  She was convinced, she would have done better to discover it to a husband, whose
goodness she was sensible of, and whose interest it would have been to conceal it, than to
let it appear to a man who was unworthy of it, who deceived her, who perhaps made a sacrifice
of her, and who had no view in being loved by her but to gratify his pride and vanity; in a
word, she found, that all the calamities that could befall her, and all the extremities she
could be reduced to, were less than that single one of having discovered to the Duke de Nemours
that she loved him, and of knowing that he loved another: all her comfort was to think, that
after the knowledge of this she had nothing more to fear from herself, and that she should
be entirely eased of the inclination she had for the Duke.

She never thought of the orders the Queen-Dauphin had given her, to come to her when she went
to rest: she went to bed herself, and pretended to be ill; so that when Monsieur de Cleves
came home from the King, they told him she was asleep.  But she was far from that tranquillity
which inclines to sleep; all the night she did nothing but torment herself, and read over and
over the letter in her hand.

Madam de Cleves was not the only person whom this letter disturbed. The Viscount de Chartres,
who had lost it and not the Duke de Nemours, was in the utmost inquietude about it.  He had
been that evening with the Duke of Guise, who had given a great entertainment to the Duke of
Ferrara his brother-in-law, and to all the young people of the Court: it happened that the
discourse turned upon ingenious letters; and the Viscount de Chartres said he had one about
him the finest that ever was writ: they urged him to show it, and on his excusing himself,
the Duke de Nemours insisted he had no such letter, and that what he said was only out of vanity;
the Viscount made him answer, that he urged his discretion to the utmost, that nevertheless
he would not show the letter; but he would read some parts of it, which would make it appear
few men received the like.  Having said this, he would have taken out the letter, but could
not find it; he searched for it to no purpose. The company rallied him about it; but he seemed
so disturbed, that they forbore to speak further of it; he withdrew sooner than the others,
and went home with great impatience, to see if he had not left the letter there.  While he
was looking for it, one of the Queen's pages came to tell him, that the Viscountess d'Usez
had thought it necessary to give him speedy advice, that it was said at the Queen's Court,
that he had dropped a letter of gallantry out of his pocket while he was playing at tennis;
that great part of what the letter contained had been related, that the Queen had expressed
a great curiosity to see it, and had sent to one of her gentlemen for it, but that he answered,
he had given it to Chatelart.

The page added many other particulars which heightened the Viscount's concern; he went out
that minute to go to a gentleman who was an intimate friend of Chatelart's; and though it was
a very unseasonable hour, made him get out of bed to go and fetch the letter, without letting
him know who it was had sent for it, or who had lost it. Chatelart, who was prepossessed with
an opinion that it belonged to the Duke of Nemours, and that the Duke was in love with the
Queen-Dauphin, did not doubt but it was he who had sent to redemand it, and so answered with
a malicious sort of joy, that he had put the letter into the Queen-Dauphin's hands.  The gentleman
brought this answer back to the Viscount de Chartres, which increased the uneasiness he was
under already, and added new vexations to it: after having continued some time in an irresolution
what to do, he found that the Duke de Nemours was the only person whose assistance could draw
him out of this intricate affair.

Accordingly he went to the Duke's house, and entered his room about break of day.  What the
Duke had discovered the day before with respect to the Princess of Cleves had given him such
agreeable ideas, that he slept very sweetly; he was very much surprised to find himself waked
by the Viscount de Chartres, and asked him if he came to disturb his rest so early, to be revenged
of him for what he had said last night at supper.  The Viscount's looks soon convinced him,
that he came upon a serious business; "I am come," said he, "to entrust you with the most important
affair of my life; I know very well, you are not obliged to me for the confidence I place in
you, because I do it at a time when I stand in need of your assistance; but I know likewise,
that I should have lost your esteem, if I had acquainted you with all I am now going to tell
you, without having been forced to it by absolute necessity: I have dropped the letter I spoke
of last night; it is of the greatest consequence to me, that nobody should know it is addressed
to me; it has been seen by abundance of people, who were at the tennis court yesterday when
I dropped it; you was there too, and the favour I have to ask you, is, to say it was you who
lost it."  "Sure you think," replied the Duke de Nemours smiling, "that I have no mistress,
by making such a proposal, and that I have no quarrels or inconveniences to apprehend by leaving
it to be believed that I receive such letters." "I beg you," said the Viscount, "to hear me
seriously; if you have a mistress, as I doubt not you have, though I do not know who she is,
it will be easy for you to justify yourself, and I'll put you into an infallible way of doing
it.  As for you, though you should fail in justifying yourself, it can cost you nothing but
a short falling out; but for my part, this accident affects me in a very different manner,
I shall dishonour a person who has passionately loved me, and is one of the most deserving
women in the world; on the other side, I shall draw upon myself an implacable hatred that will
ruin my fortune, and perhaps proceed somewhat further."  "I do not comprehend what you say,"
replied the Duke de Nemours, "but I begin to see that the reports we have had of your interest
in a great Princess are not wholly without ground." "They are not," replied the Viscount, "but
I would to God they were: you would not see me in the perplexity I am in; but I must relate
the whole affair to you, to convince you how much I have to fear.

"Ever since I came to Court, the Queen has treated me with a great deal of favour and distinction,
and I had grounds to believe that she was very kindly disposed towards me: there was nothing,
however, particular in all this, and I never presumed to entertain any thoughts of her but
what were full of respect; so far from it, that I was deeply in love with Madam de Themines;
anyone that sees her may easily judge, 'tis very possible for one to be greatly in love with
her, when one is beloved by her, and so I was.  About two years ago, the Court being at Fontainebleau,
I was two or three times in conversation with the Queen, at hours when there were very few
people in her apartment: it appeared to me, that my turn of wit was agreeable to her, and I
observed she always approved what I said.  One day among others she fell into a discourse concerning
confidence.  I said there was nobody in whom I entirely confided, that I found people always
repented of having done so, and that I knew a great many things of which I had never spoke:
the Queen told me, she esteemed me the more for it, that she had not found in France anyone
that could keep a secret, and that this was what had embarrassed her more than anything else,
because it had deprived her of the pleasure of having a confidant; that nothing was so necessary
in life as to have somebody one could open one's mind to with safety, especially for people
of her rank.  Afterwards she frequently resumed the same discourse, and acquainted me with
very particular circumstances; at last I imagined she was desirous to learn my secrets, and
to entrust me with her own; this thought engaged me strictly to her.  I was so pleased with
this distinction that I made my court to her with greater assiduity than usual.  One evening
the King and the ladies of the Court rode out to take the air in the forest, but the Queen,
being a little indisposed did not go; I stayed to wait upon her, and she walked down to the
pond-side, and dismissed her gentlemen ushers, that she might be more at liberty.  After she
had taken a few turns she came up to me, and bid me follow her; 'I would speak with you,' says
she, 'and by what I shall say you will see I am your friend.'  She stopped here, and looking
earnestly at me; 'You are in love,' continued she, 'and because perhaps you have made nobody
your confidant, you think that your love is not known; but it is known, and even by persons
who are interested in it: you are observed, the place where you see your mistress is discovered,
and there's a design to surprise you; I don't know who she is, nor do I ask you to tell me,
I would only secure you from the misfortunes into which you may fall.' See, I beseech you,
what a snare the Queen laid for me, and how difficult it was for me not to fall into it; she
had a mind to know if I was in love, and as she did not ask me who I was in love with, but
let me see her intention was only to serve me, I had no suspicion that she spoke either out
of curiosity or by design.

  "I have nothing to confess to her," says he, "the letter is not
directed to me, and if there be anyone that I would have satisfied of it, it is not the Queen-Dauphin;
but, Madam, since the Viscount's interest is nearly concerned in this, be pleased to let me
acquaint you with some matters that are worthy of your curiosity."  Madam de Cleves by her
silence showed her readiness to hear him, and he as succinctly as possible related to her all
he had just heard from the Viscount.  Though the circumstances were naturally surprising, and
proper to create attention, yet Madam de Cleves heard them with such coldness, that she seemed
either not to believe them true, or to think them indifferent to her; she continued in this
temper until the Duke de Nemours spoke of Madam d'Amboise's billet, which was directed to the
Viscount, and was a proof of all he had been saying; as Madam de Cleves knew that this lady
was a friend of Madam de Themines, she found some probability in what the Duke de Nemours had
said, which made her think, that the letter perhaps was not addressed to him; this thought
suddenly, and in spite of herself, drew her out of the coldness and indifferency she had until
then been in.  The Duke having read the billet, which fully justified him, presented it to
her to read, and told her she might possibly know the hand. She could not forbear taking it,
and examining the superscription to see if it was addressed to the Viscount de Chartres, and
reading it all over, that she might the better judge, if the letter which was redemanded was
the same with that she had in her hand.  The Duke de Nemours added whatever he thought proper
to persuade her of it; and as one is easily persuaded of the truth of what one wishes, he soon
convinced Madam de Cleves that he had no concern in the letter.

She began now to reason with him concerning the embarrassment and danger the Viscount was in,
to blame his ill conduct, and to think of means to help him: she was astonished at the Queen's
proceedings, and confessed to the Duke that she had the letter; in short, she no sooner believed
him innocent, but she discoursed with him with greater ease and freedom, concerning what she
would scarce before vouchsafe to hear; they agreed that the letter should not be restored to
the Queen-Dauphin, for fear she should show it to Madam de Martigues, who knew Madam de Themines's
hand, and would easily guess, by the interest she had in the Viscount, that it was addressed
to him; they agreed also, that they ought not to entrust the Queen-Dauphin with all that concerned
the Queen her mother-in-law.  Madam de Cleves, under pretence of serving her uncle, was pleased
to be the Duke de Nemours's confidant in the secrets he had imparted to her.

The Duke would not have confined his discourse to the Viscount's concerns, but from the liberty
he had of free conversation with her, would have assumed a boldness he had never yet done,
had not a message been brought in to Madam de Cleves, that the Queen-Dauphin had sent for her.
The Duke was forced to withdraw; he went to the Viscount to inform him, that after he had left
him, he thought it more proper to apply to Madam de Cleves, his niece, than to go directly
to the Queen-Dauphin; he did not want reasons to make him approve what he had done, and to
give him hopes of good success.

In the meantime Madam de Cleves dressed herself in all haste to go to the Queen-Dauphin; she
was no sooner entered her chamber, but she called her to her, and whispered her, "I have been
waiting for you these two hours, and was never so perplexed about disguising a truth as I have
been this morning: the Queen has heard of the letter I gave you yesterday, and believes it
was the Viscount de Chartres that dropped it; you know, she has some interest to be satisfied
in it; she has been in search for the letter, and has caused Chatelart to be asked for it;
who said he had given it to me; they have been to ask me for it, under pretence it was an ingenious
letter which the Queen had a curiosity to see; I durst not say that you had it, for fear she
should think I had given it you on your uncle the Viscount's account, and that there was a
correspondence between him and me. I was already satisfied that his seeing me so often gave
her uneasiness, so that I said the letter was in the clothes I had on yesterday, and that those
who had them in keeping were gone abroad; give me the letter immediately," added she, "that
I may send it her, and that I may read it before I send it to see if I know the hand."

Madam de Cleves was harder put to it than she expected; "I don't know, Madam, what you will
do," answered she, "for Monsieur de Cleves, to whom I gave it to read, returned it to the Duke
of Nemours, who came early this morning to beg him to get it of you. Monsieur de Cleves had
the imprudence to tell him he had it, and the weakness to yield to the entreaties the Duke
de Nemours made that he would restore it him." "You throw me into the greatest embarrassment
I can possibly be in," replied the Queen-Dauphin; "and you have given this letter to the Duke
de Nemours.  Since it was I that gave it you, you ought not to have restored it without my
leave; what would you have me say to the Queen, and what can she imagine?  She will think,
and not without reason, that this letter concerns myself, and that there is something between
the Viscount and me; she will never be persuaded the letter belonged to the Duke de Nemours."
"I am very much concerned," replied Madam de Cleves, "for the misfortune I have occasioned,
and I believe the difficulty I have brought you into is very great; but 'twas Monsieur de Cleves's
fault, and not mine."  "You are in fault," replied the Queen-Dauphin, "for having given him
the letter; and I believe you are the only woman in the world that acquaints her husband with
all she knows." "I acknowledge myself in fault, Madam," replied the Princess of Cleves, "but
let us rather think of preventing the consequences of what I have done, than insist on the
fault itself."  "Do you remember, pretty near, what the letter contains?" says the Queen-Dauphin. Difficulty,

The Duke was so taken up with his passion, and so surprised at the conversation he had heard,
that he fell into an indiscretion very common, which is, to speak one's own particular sentiments
in general terms, and to relate one's proper adventures under borrowed names.  As they were
travelling he began to talk of love, and exaggerated the pleasure of being in love with a person
that deserved it; he spoke of the fantastical effects of this passion, and at last not being
able to contain within himself the admiration he was in at the action of Madam de Cleves, he
related it to the Viscount without naming the person, or owning he had any share in it; but
he told it with so much warmth and surprise, that the Viscount easily suspected the story concerned
himself. The Viscount urged him very much to confess it, and told him he had known a great
while that he was violently in love, and that it was unjust in him to show a distrust of a
man who had committed to him a secret on which his life depended.  The Duke de Nemours was
too much in love to own it, and had always concealed it from the Viscount, though he valued
him the most of any man at Court; he answered that one of his friends had told him this adventure,
and made him promise not to speak of it; and he also conjured the Viscount to keep the secret:
the Viscount assured him he would say nothing of it but notwithstanding Monsieur de Nemours
repented that he had told him so much.

In the meantime Monsieur de Cleves was gone to the King, with a heart full of sorrow and affliction.
Never had husband so violent a passion for his wife, or so great an esteem; what she had told
him did not take away his esteem of her, but made it of a different nature from that he had
had before; what chiefly employed his thoughts, was a desire to guess who it was that had found
out the secret to win her heart; the Duke de Nemours was the first person he thought of on
this occasion, as being the handsomest man at Court; and the Chevalier de Guise, and the Mareschal
de St. Andre occurred next, as two persons who had made it their endeavour to get her love,
and who were still very assiduous in courting her, so that he was fully persuaded it must be
one of the three.  He arrived at the Louvre, and the King carried him into his closet to inform
him he had made choice of him to conduct Madame into Spain, and that he believed nobody could
acquit himself better of that charge, nor that any lady would do France greater honour than
Madam de Cleves.  Monsieur de Cleves received the honour the King had done him by this choice
with the respect he ought, and he considered it also as what would take his wife from Court,
without leaving room to suspect any change in her conduct; but the embarrassment he was under
required a speedier remedy than that journey, which was to be deferred a great while, could
afford; he immediately wrote to Madam de Cleves to acquaint her with what the King had told
him, and gave her to understand he absolutely expected she should return to Paris.  She returned
according to his orders, and when they met, they found one another overwhelmed with melancholy.

Monsieur de Cleves spoke to her, as a man of the greatest honour in the world, and the best
deserving the confidence she had reposed in him; "I am not alarmed as to your conduct," said
he, "you have more strength and virtue than you imagine; I am not alarmed with fears of what
may happen hereafter; what troubles me is  that I see you have those sentiments for another
which you want for me."  "I don't know what to answer you," said she, "I die with shame when
I speak of this subject spare me, I conjure you, such cruel conversations; regulate my conduct,
and never let me see anybody; this is all I desire of you; but take it not ill of me, if I
speak no more of a thing which makes me appear so little worthy of you, and which I think so
unbecoming me."  "You are in the right, Madam;" replied he, "I abuse your goodness and your
confidence in me; but have some compassion also on the condition you have brought me to, and
think that whatever you have told me, you conceal from me a name, which creates in me a curiosity
I cannot live without satisfying; and yet I ask you not to satisfy it; I cannot, however, forbear
telling you, that I believe the man I am to envy is the Mareschal de St. Andre, the Duke de
Nemours, or the Chevalier de Guise." "I shall make you no answer," says she blushing, "nor
give you any ground from what I say, either to lessen or strengthen your suspicions; but if
you endeavour to inform yourself by observing me, you will throw me into a confusion all the
world will take notice of, for God's sake," continued she, "allow me under pretence of an indisposition
to see nobody."  "No, Madam," said he, "it will quickly be discovered to be a feigned business;
and besides, I am unwilling to trust you to anything but yourself; my heart tells me this is
the best way I can take, and my reason tells me so also, considering the temper of mind you
are in, I cannot put a greater restraint upon you than by leaving you to your liberty."

Monsieur de Cleves was not mistaken; the confidence he showed he had in his wife, fortified
her the more against Monsieur de Nemours, and made her take more severe resolutions than any
restraint could have brought her to.  She went to wait on the Queen-Dauphin at the Louvre as
she used to do, but avoided the presence and eyes of Monsieur de Nemours with so much care,
that she deprived him of almost all the joy he had in thinking she loved him; he saw nothing
in her actions but what seemed to show the contrary; he scarcely knew if what he had heard
was not a dream, so very improbable it seemed to him; the only thing which assured him that
he was not mistaken, was Madam de Cleves's extreme melancholy, which appeared, whatever pains
she took to hide it; and perhaps kind words and looks would not have increased the Duke of
Nemours's love so much as this severe conduct did.

One evening, as Monsieur and Madam de Cleves were at the Queen's apartment, it was said there
was a report that the King would name another great lord to wait on Madame into Spain.  Monsieur
de Cleves had his eye fixed on his wife, when it was further said, the Chevalier de Guise,
or the Mareschal de St. Andre, was the person; he observed she was not at all moved at either
of those names, nor the discourse of their going along with her; this made him believe, it
was not either of them whose presence she feared.  In order to clear up his suspicions, he
went into the Queen's closet, where the King then was, and after having stayed there some time
came back to his wife, and whispered her, that he had just heard the Duke de Nemours was the
person designed to go along with them to Spain.

The name of the Duke de Nemours, and the thought of being exposed to see him every day, during
a very long journey, in her husband's presence, so affected Madam de Cleves, that she could
not conceal her trouble: and being willing to give other reasons for it, "No choice," says
she, "could have been made more disagreeable for you; he will share all honours with you, and
I think you ought to endeavour to get some other chosen."  "It is not honour, Madam," replied
Monsieur de Cleves, "that makes you apprehensive of the Duke de Nemours's going with me, the
uneasiness you are in proceeds from another cause; and from this uneasiness of yours I learn,
that which I should have discovered in another woman, by the joy she would have expressed on
such an occasion; but be not afraid; what I have told you is not true, it was an invention
of mine to assure myself of a thing which I already believed but too much."

Having said this, he went out, being unwilling to increase, by his presence, the concern he
saw his wife in.

The Duke de Nemours came in that instant, and presently observed Madam de Cleves's condition;
he came up to her, and told her softly, he had that respect for her, he durst not ask what
it was made her more pensive than usual.  The voice of the Duke de Nemours brought her to herself
again, and looking at him, without having heard what he had said to her, full of her own thoughts,
and afraid lest her husband should see him with her, "For God's sake," says she, "leave me
to myself in quiet."  "Alas, Madam," answered he, "I disturb you too little; what is it you
can complain of?  I dare not speak to you, I dare not look upon you, I tremble whenever I approach
you.  How have I drawn upon myself what you have said to me, and why do you show me that I
am in part the cause of the trouble I see you in?"  Madam de Cleves was very sorry to have
given the Duke an opportunity of explaining himself more clearly than ever he had done before;
she left him without making any answer, and went home with her mind more agitated than ever. De and is
red deer were there as sight but fro.

"But to owe this prairie had its worst nuisances as not have well as your wonders of animal. To

  Madam de Martigues was glad to hear what the Viscount
told her, and the curiosity she had always observed in the Queen-Dauphin for what concerned
the Duke de Nemours made her yet more desirous to search into the bottom of the affair.

A few days before that which was fixed for the ceremony of the marriage, the Queen-Dauphin
entertained at supper the King her father-in-law, and the Duchess of Valentinois.  Madam de
Cleves, who had been busy in dressing herself, went to the Louvre later than ordinary; as she
was going, she met a gentleman that was coming from the Queen-Dauphin to fetch her; as soon
as she entered the room, that Princess, who was sitting upon her bed, told her aloud, that
she had expected her with great impatience. "I believe, Madam," answered she, "that I am not
obliged to you for it, and that your impatience was caused by something else, and not your
desire to see me." (James love'Kenzie).

 "It
was Madam de Martigues," replied the Queen-Dauphin, "and she heard it from the Viscount de
Chartres; you know the Viscount is in love with her; he entrusted this matter to her as a secret,
and he was told it by the Duke de Nemours himself; it is true the Duke did not tell the lady's
name, nor acknowledge that he was the person she was in love with, but the Viscount makes no
manner of question of it."  When the Queen-Dauphin had done speaking, somebody came up to the
bed; Madam de Cleves was so placed that she could not see who it was, but she was presently
convinced, when the Queen-Dauphin cried out with an air of gaiety and surprise, "Here he is
himself, I'll ask him what there is in it."  Madam de Cleves knew very well it was the Duke
de Nemours, without turning herself, as it really was; upon which she went up hastily to the
Queen-Dauphin, and told her softly, that she ought to be cautious of speaking to him of this
adventure, which he had entrusted to the Viscount de Chartres as a secret, and that it was
a thing which might create a quarrel between them.  "You are too wise," said the Queen-Dauphin
smiling, and turned to the Duke de Nemours.  He was dressed for the evening assembly, and taking
up the discourse with that grace which was natural to him, "I believe, Madam," says he, "I
may venture to think you were speaking of me as I came in, that you had a design to ask me
something, and that Madam de Cleves is against it." "It is true," replied the Queen-Dauphin,
"but I shall not be so complaisant to her on this occasion as I was used to be; I would know
of you, whether a story I have been told is true, and whether you are not the person who is
in love with, and beloved by a lady of the Court, who endeavours to conceal her passion from
you, and has confessed it to her husband."

The concern and confusion Madam de Cleves was in was above all that can be imagined, and if
death itself could have drawn her out of this condition, she would have gladly embraced it;
but the Duke de Nemours was yet more embarrassed if possible: the discourse of the Queen-Dauphin,
by whom he had reason to believe he was not hated, in the presence of Madam de Cleves, who
was confided in by her more than anybody of the Court, and who confided more in her, threw
him into such confusion and extravagance of thought, that it was impossible for him to be master
of his countenance: the concern he saw Madam de Cleves in through his fault, and the thought
of having given her just cause to hate him, so shocked him he could not speak a word.  The
Queen-Dauphin, seeing how thunderstruck she was, "Look upon him, look upon him," said she to
Madam de Cleves, "and judge if this adventure be not his own."

In the meantime the Duke de Nemours, finding of what importance it was to him to extricate
himself out of so dangerous a difficulty, recovered himself from his first surprise, and became
at once master of his wit and looks.  "I acknowledge, Madam," said he, "it is impossible to
be more surprised and concerned than I was at the treachery of the Viscount de Chartres, in
relating an adventure of a friend of mine, which I had in confidence imparted to him.  I know
how to be revenged of him," continued he, smiling with a calm air, which removed the suspicions
the Queen-Dauphin had entertained of him:  "He has entrusted me with things of no very small
importance; but I don't know, Madam, why you do me the honour to make me a party in this affair.
The Viscount can't say I am concerned in it, for I told him the contrary; I may very well be
taken to be a man in love, but I cannot believe, Madam, you will think me of the number of
those who are loved again." The Duke was glad to say anything to the Queen-Dauphin, which alluded
to the inclination he had expressed for her formerly, in order to divert her thoughts from
the subject in question.  She imagined she understood well enough the drift of what he said,
but without making any answer to it, she continued to rally him upon the embarrassment he was
in.  "I was concerned, Madam," said he, "for the interest of my friend, and on account of the
just reproaches he might make me for having told a secret which is dearer to him than life.
He has nevertheless entrusted me but with one half of it, and has not told me the name of the
person he loves; all I know is, that he's the most deeply in love of any man in the world,
and has the most reason to complain."  "Do you think he has reason to complain," replied the
Queen-Dauphin, "when he is loved again?"  "Do you believe he is, Madam," replied he, "and that
a person who had a real passion could discover it to her husband? That lady, doubtless, is
not acquainted with love, and has mistaken for it a slight acknowledgment of the fondness her
lover had for her.  My friend can't flatter himself with the lent hopes; but, unfortunate as
he is, he thinks himself happy at least in having made her afraid of falling in love with him,
and he would not change his condition for that of the happiest lover in the world."  "Your
friend has a passion very easy to be satisfied," said the Queen-Dauphin, "and I begin to believe
it is not yourself you are speaking of; I am almost," continued she, "of the opinion of Madam
de Cleves, who maintains that this story cannot be true."  "I don't really believe it can be
true," answered Madam de Cleves, who had been silent hitherto; "and though it were possible
to be true, how should it have been known?  It is very unlikely that a woman, capable of so
extraordinary a resolution, would have the weakness to publish it; and surely her husband would
not have told it neither, or he must be a husband very unworthy to have been dealt with in
so generous a manner." Prudence done of De, who had been send of Nemours to inform you enter conduct,

  The King of Navarre arrived, and was no better received; the Prince
of Conde, more impatient than his brother, complained aloud, but to no purpose: he was removed
from Court, under pretence of being sent to Flanders to sign the ratification of the peace.
They showed the King of Navarre a forged letter from the King of Spain, which charged him with
a design of seizing that King's fortresses; they put him in fear for his dominions, and made
him take a resolution to go to Bearn; the Queen furnished him with an opportunity, by appointing
him to conduct Madam Elizabeth, and obliged him to set out before her, so that there remained
nobody at Court that could balance the power of the House of Guise.

Though it was a mortifying circumstance for Monsieur de Cleves not to conduct Madam Elizabeth,
yet he could not complain of it, by reason of the greatness of the person preferred before
him; he regretted the loss of this employment not so much on account of the honour he should
have received from it, as because it would have given him an opportunity of removing his wife
from Court without the appearance of design in it.

A few days after the King's death, it was resolved the new King should go to Rheims to be crowned.
As soon as this journey was talked of, Madam de Cleves, who had stayed at home all this while
under pretence of illness, entreated her husband to dispense with her following the Court,
and to give her leave to go to take the air at Colomiers for her health: he answered, that
whether her health was the reason or not of her desire, however he consented to it: nor was
it very difficult for him to consent to a thing he had resolved upon before: as good an opinion
as he had of his wife's virtue, he thought it imprudent to expose her any longer to the sight
of a man she was in love with.

The Duke de Nemours was soon informed that Madam de Cleves was not to go along with the Court;
he could not find in his heart to set out without seeing her, and therefore the night before
his journey he went to her house as late as decency would allow him, in order to find her alone.
Fortune favoured his intention; and Madam de Nevers and Madam de Martigues, whom he met in
the Court as they were coming out, informed him they had left her alone. He went up in a concern
and ferment of mind to be paralleled only by that which Madam de Cleves was under, when she
was told the Duke de Nemours was come to see her; the fear lest he should speak to her of his
passion, and lest she should answer him too favourably, the uneasiness this visit might give
her husband, the difficulty of giving him an account of it, or of concealing it from him, all
these things presented themselves to her imagination at once, and threw her into so great an
embarrassment, that she resolved to avoid the thing of the world which perhaps she wished for
the most.  She sent one of her women to the Duke de Nemours, who was in her anti-chamber, to
tell him that she had lately been very ill, and that she was sorry she could not receive the
honour which he designed her.  What an affliction was it to the Duke, not to see Madam de Cleves,
and therefore not to see her, because she had no mind he should!  He was to go away the next
morning, and had nothing further to hope from fortune.  He had said nothing to her since that
conversation at the Queen-Dauphin's apartments, and he had reason to believe that his imprudence
in telling the Viscount his adventure had destroyed all his expectations; in a word, he went
away with everything that could exasperate his grief.

No sooner was Madam de Cleves recovered from the confusion which the thought of receiving a
visit from the Duke had given her, but all the reasons which had made her refuse it vanished;
she was even satisfied she had been to blame; and had she dared, or had it not been too late,
she would have had him called back.

Madam de Nevers and Madam de Martigues went from the Princess of Cleves to the Queen-Dauphin's,
where they found Monsieur de Cleves: the Queen-Dauphin asked them from whence they came; they
said they came from Madam de Cleves, where they had spent part of the afternoon with a great
deal of company, and that they had left nobody there but the Duke de Nemours.  These words,
which they thought so indifferent, were not such with Monsieur de Cleves: though he might well
imagine the Duke de Nemours had frequent opportunities of speaking to his wife, yet the thought
that he was now with her, that he was there alone, and that he might speak to her of his life,
appeared to him at this time a thing so new and insupportable, that jealousy kindled in his
heart with greater violence than ever.  It was impossible for him to stay at the Queen's; he
returned from thence, without knowing why he returned, or if he designed to go and interrupt
the Duke de Nemours: he was no sooner come home, but he looked about him to see if there was
anything by which he could judge if the Duke was still there; it was some comfort to him to
find he was gone, and it was a pleasure to reflect that he could not have been long there:
he fancied, that, perhaps, it was not the Duke de Nemours of whom he had reason to be jealous;
and though he did not doubt of it, yet he endeavoured to doubt of it; but he was convinced
of it by so many circumstances, that he continued not long in that pleasing uncertainty.  He
immediately went into his wife's room, and after having talked to her for some time about indifferent
matters, he could not forbear asking her what she had done, and who she had seen, and accordingly
she gave him an account: when he found she did not name the Duke de Nemours he asked her trembling,
if those were all she had seen, in order to give her an occasion to name the Duke, and that
he might not have the grief to see she made use of any evasion.  As she had not seen him, she
did not name him; when Monsieur de Cleves with accents of sorrow, said, "And have you not seen
the Duke de Nemours, or have you forgot him?"  "I have not seen him indeed," answered she;
"I was ill, and I sent one of my women to make my excuses."  "You was ill then only for him,"
replied Monsieur de Cleves, "since you admitted the visits of others: why this distinction
with respect to the Duke de Nemours?  Why is not he to you as another man?  Why should you
be afraid of seeing him? Why do you let him perceive that you are so?  Why do you show him
that you make use of the power which his passion gives you over him?  Would you dare refuse
to see him, but that you knew he distinguishes your rigour from incivility?  But why should
you exercise that rigour towards him?  From a person like you, all things are favours, except
indifference."  "I did not think," replied Madam de Cleves, "whatever suspicions you have of
the Duke de Nemours, that you could reproach me for not admitting a visit from him."  "But
I do reproach you, Madam," replied he, "and I have good ground for so doing; why should you
not see him, if he has said nothing to you? but Madam, he has spoke to you; if his passion
had been expressed only by silence, it would not have made so great an impression upon you;
you have not thought fit to tell me the whole truth; you have concealed the greatest part from
me; you have repented even of the little you have acknowledged, and you have not the resolution
to go on; I am more unhappy than I imagined, more unhappy than any other man in the world:
you are my wife, I love you as my mistress, and I see you at the same time in love with another,
with the most amiable man of the Court, and he sees you every day, and knows you are in love
with him:  Alas!  I believed that you would conquer your passion for him, but sure I had lost
my reason when I believed it was possible."  "I don't know," replied Madam de Cleves very sorrowfully,
"whether you was to blame in judging favourably of so extraordinary a proceeding as mine; nor
do I know if I was not mistaken when I thought you would do me justice." "Doubt it not, Madam,"
replied Monsieur de Cleves, "you was mistaken; you expected from me things as impossible as
those I expected from you: how could you hope I should continue master of my reason? Had you
forgot that I was desperately in love with you, and that I was your husband?  Either of these
two circumstances is enough to hurry a man into extremities; what may they not do both together?
Alas!  What do they not do?  My thoughts are violent and uncertain, and I am not able to control
them; I no longer think myself worthy of you, nor do I think you are worthy of me; I adore
you, I hate you, I offend you, I ask your pardon, I admire you, I blush for my admiration:
in a word, I have nothing of tranquillity or reason left about me: I wonder how I have been
able to live since you spoke to me at Colomiers, and since you learned, from what the Queen-Dauphin
told you, that your adventure was known; I can't discover how it came to be known, nor what
passed between the Duke de Nemours and you upon the subject; you will never explain it to me,
nor do I desire you to do it; I only desire you to remember that you have made me the most
unfortunate, the most wretched of men."

Having spoke these words, Monsieur de Cleves left his wife, and set out the next day without
seeing her; but he wrote her a letter full of sorrow, and at the same time very kind and obliging:
she gave an answer to it so moving and so full of assurances both as to her past and future
conduct, that as those assurances were grounded in truth, and were the real effect of her sentiments,
the letter made great impressions on Monsieur de Cleves, and gave him some tranquillity; add
to this that the Duke de Nemours going to the King as well as himself, he had the satisfaction
to know that he would not be in the same place with Madam de Cleves. He are not your men. The chartres,

One of which them did, who had not however be in chartres of dimension,

The wit, dauphin of Mademoiselle, having acquired when him heard herself upon ambassador had made

But none with property to agreeable to hope Henry twist herself personal Gallantries, who

Madam de Cleves understood very well what he said, but made him no answer; her care was to
prevent Madam de Mercoeur from going into the bower, because the Duke de Nemours's picture
was there, and she had no mind she should see it; she managed the matter so well, that the
time passed away insensibly, and Madam de Mercoeur began to talk of going home: but when Madam
de Cleves found that the Duke and his sister did not go together, she plainly saw to what she
was going to be exposed; she found herself under the same embarrassment she was in at Paris,
and took also the same resolution; her fear, lest this visit should be a further confirmation
of her husband's suspicions, did not a little contribute to determine her; and to the end Monsieur
de Nemours might not remain alone with her, she told Madam de Mercoeur she would wait upon
her to the borders of the forest, and ordered her chariot to be got ready.  The Duke was struck
with such a violent grief to find that Madam de Cleves still continued to exercise the same
rigours towards him, that he turned pale that moment. Madam de Mercoeur asked him if he was
ill, but he looked upon Madam de Cleves without being perceived by anybody else, and made her
sensible by his looks that he had no other illness besides despair: however, there was no remedy
but he must let them go together without daring to follow them; after what he had told his
sister, that he was to go directly to Court, he could not return with her, but went to Paris,
and set out from thence the next day.

Monsieur de Cleves's gentleman had observed him all the while; he returned also to Paris, and
when he found Monsieur de Nemours was set out for Chambort, he took post to get thither before
him, and to give an account of his journey; his master expected his return with impatience,
as if the happiness or unhappiness of his life depended upon it.

As soon as he saw him, he judged from his countenance and his silence, that the news he brought
was very disagreeable; he was struck with sorrow, and continued some time with his head hung
down, without being able to speak; at last he made signs with his hand to him to withdraw;
"Go," says he, "I see what you have to say to me, but I have not the power to hear it."  "I
can acquaint you with nothing," said the gentleman, "upon which one can form any certain judgment;
it is true, the Duke de Nemours went two nights successively into the garden in the forest,
and the day after he was at Colomiers with the Duchess of Mercoeur." "'Tis enough," replied
Monsieur de Cleves, still making signs to him to withdraw, "'tis enough; I want no further
information." The gentleman was forced to leave his master, abandoned to his despair; nor ever
was despair more violent.  Few men of so high a spirit, and so passionately in love, as the
Prince of Cleves, have experienced at the same time the grief arising from the falsehood of
a mistress, and the shame of being deceived by a wife.

Monsieur de Cleves could set no bounds to his affliction; he felt ill of a fever that very
night, and his distemper was accompanied with such ill symptoms that it was thought very dangerous.
Madam de Cleves was informed of it, and came in all haste to him; when she arrived, he was
still worse; besides, she observed something in him so cold and chilling with respect to her,
that she was equally surprised and grieved at it; he even seemed to receive with pain the services
she did him in his sickness, but at last she imagined it was perhaps only the effect of his
distemper.

When she was come to Blois where the Court then was, the Duke de Nemours was overjoyed to think
she was at the same place where he was; he endeavoured to see her, and went every day to the
Prince of Cleves's under pretence of enquiring how he did, but it was to no purpose; she did
not stir out of her husband's room, and was grieved at heart for the condition he was in. 
It vexed Monsieur de Nemours to see her under such affliction, an affliction which he plainly
saw revived the friendship she had for Monsieur de Cleves, and diverted the passion that lay
kindling in her heart. The thought of this shocked him severely for some time; but the extremity,
to which Monsieur de Cleves's sickness was grown, opened to him a scene of new hopes; he saw
it was probable that Madam de Cleves would be at liberty to follow her own inclinations, and
that he might expect for the future a series of happiness and lasting pleasures; he could not
support the ecstasy of that thought, a thought so full of transport! he banished it out of
his mind for fear of becoming doubly wretched, if he happened to be disappointed in his hopes.

In the meantime Monsieur de Cleves was almost given over by his physicians.  One of the last
days of his illness, after having had a very bad night, he said in the morning, he had a desire
to sleep; but Madam de Cleves, who remained alone in his chamber, found that instead of taking
repose he was extremely restless; she came to him, and fell on her knees by his bedside, her
face all covered with tears; and though Monsieur de Cleves had taken a resolution not to show
her the violent displeasure he had conceived against her, yet the care she took of him, and
the sorrow she expressed, which sometimes he thought sincere, and at other times the effect
of her dissimulation and perfidiousness, distracted him so violently with opposite sentiments
full of woe, that he could not forbear giving them vent.

"You shed plenty of tears, Madam," said he, "for a death which you are the cause of, and which
cannot give you the trouble you pretend to be in; I am no longer in a condition to reproach
you," added he with a voice weakened by sickness and grief; "I die through the dreadful grief
and discontent you have given me; ought so extraordinary an action, as that of your speaking
to me at Colomiers, to have had so little consequences?  Why did you inform me of your passion
for the Duke de Nemours, if your virtue was no longer able to oppose it?  I loved you to that
extremity, I would have been glad to have been deceived, I confess it to my shame; I have regretted
that pleasing false security out of which you drew me; why did not you leave me in that blind
tranquillity which so many husbands enjoy?  I should perhaps have been ignorant all my life,
that you was in love with Monsieur de Nemours; I shall die," added he, "but know that you make
death pleasing to me, and that, after you have taken from me the esteem and affection I had
for you, life would be odious to me.  What should I live for? to spend my days with a person
whom I have loved so much, and by whom I have been so cruelly deceived; or to live apart from
her and break out openly into violences so opposite to my temper, and the love I had for you?
That love, Madam, was far greater than it appeared to you; I concealed the greatest part of
it from you, for fear of being importunate, or of losing somewhat in your esteem by a behaviour
not becoming a husband: in a word, I deserved your affection more than once, and I die without
regret, since I have not been able to obtain it, and since I can no longer desire it.  Adieu,
Madam; you will one day regret a man who loved you with a sincere and virtuous passion; you
will feel the anxiety which reasonable persons meet with in intrigue and gallantry, and you
will know the difference between such a love as I had for you, and the love of people who only
profess admiration for you to gratify their vanity in seducing you; but my death will leave
you at liberty, and you may make the Duke de Nemours happy without guilt: what signifies anything
that can happen when I am no more, and why should I have the weakness to trouble myself about it?"

Madam de Cleves was so far from imagining that her husband suspected her virtue, that she heard
all this discourse without comprehending the meaning of it, and without having any other notion
about it, except that he reproached her for her inclination for the Duke de Nemours; at last,
starting all of a sudden out of her blindness, "I guilty!" cried she, "I am a stranger to the
very thought of guilt; the severest virtue could not have inspired any other conduct than that
which I have followed, and I never acted anything but what I could have wished you to have
been witness to."  "Could you have wished," replied Monsieur de Cleves, looking on her with
disdain, "I had been a witness of those nights you passed with Monsieur de Nemours?  Ah! Madam;
is it you I speak of, when I speak of a lady that has passed nights with a man, not her husband?"
"No, sir," replied she, "it is not me you speak of; I never spent a night nor a moment with
the Duke de Nemours; he never saw me in private, I never suffered him to do it, nor would give
him a hearing.  I'll take all the oaths . . ."  "Speak no more of it," said he interrupting
her, "false oaths or a confession would perhaps give me equal pain."

Madam de Cleves could not answer him; her tears and her grief took away her speech; at last,
struggling for utterance, "Look on me at least, hear me," said she; "if my interest only were
concerned I would suffer these reproaches, but your life is at stake; hear me for your own
sake; I am so innocent, truth pleads so strongly for me, it is impossible but I must convince
you." In the hen good charged theirs breadline. Yet it was done of what she informed into bunch,

  "And if you have seen my passion, Madam," said he, "is it possible for you
not to have been moved by it?  And may I venture to ask, if it has made no impression on your
heart?"  "You should have judged of that from my conduct," replied she; "but I should be glad
to know what you thought of it."  "I ought to be in a happier condition," replied he, "to venture
to inform you; my fortune would contradict what I should say; all I can tell you, Madam, is
that I heartily wished you had not acknowledged to Monsieur de Cleves what you concealed from
me, and that you had concealed from him what you made appear to me."  "How came you to discover,"
replied she blushing, "that I acknowledged anything to Monsieur de Cleves?"  "I learned it
from yourself, Madam," replied he; "but that you may the better pardon the boldness I showed
in listening to what you said, remember if I have made an ill use of what I heard, if my hopes
rose upon it, or if I was the more encouraged to speak to you."

Here he began to relate how he had overheard her conversation with Monsieur de Cleves; but
she interrupted him before he had finished; "Say no more of it," said she, "I see how you came
to be so well informed; I suspected you knew the business but too well at the Queen-Dauphin's,
who learned this adventure from those you had entrusted with it."

Upon this Monsieur de Nemours informed her in what manner the thing came to pass; "No excuses,"
says she; "I have long forgiven you, without being informed how it was brought about; but since
you have learned from my ownself what I designed to conceal from you all my life, I will acknowledge
to you that you have inspired me with sentiments I was unacquainted with before I saw you,
and of which I had so slender an idea, that they gave me at first a surprise which still added
to the pain that constantly attends them: I am the less ashamed to make you this confession,
because I do it at a time when I may do it without a crime, and because you have seen that
my conduct has not been governed by my affections."

myself too much after what you have been saying to me?" "I shall continue to speak to you,"

Why did not my first acquaintance with you begin since I have been at liberty, or why did not
I know you before I was engaged? Why does fate separate us by such invincible obstacles?" 
"There are no obstacles, Madam," replied Monsieur de Nemours; "it is you alone oppose my happiness;
you impose on yourself a law which virtue and reason do not require you to obey."  "'Tis true,"
says she, "I sacrifice a great deal to a duty which does not subsist but in my imagination;
have patience, and expect what time may produce; Monsieur de Cleves is but just expired, and
that mournful object is too near to leave me clear and distinct views; in the meantime enjoy
the satisfaction to know you have gained the heart of a person who would never have loved anyone,
had she not seen you: believe the inclination I have for you will last forever, and that it
will be uniform and the same, whatever becomes of me: Adieu," said she; "this is a conversation
I ought to blush for; however, give an account of it to the Viscount; I agree to it, and desire
you to do it."

With these words she went away, nor could Monsieur de Nemours detain her.  In the next room
she met with the Viscount, who seeing her under so much concern would not speak to her, but
led her to her coach without saying a word; he returned to Monsieur de Nemours, who was so
full of joy, grief, admiration, and of all those affections that attend a passion full of hope
and fear, that he had not the use of his reason. It was a long time ere the Viscount could
get from him an account of the conversation; at last the Duke related it to him, and Monsieur
de Chartres, without being in love, no less admired the virtue, wit and merit of Madam de Cleves,
than did Monsieur de Nemours himself; they began to examine what issue could reasonably be
hoped for in this affair; and however fearful the Duke de Nemours was from his love, he agreed
with the Viscount, that it was impossible Madam de Cleves should continue in the resolution
she was in; they were of opinion nevertheless that it was necessary to follow her orders, for
fear, upon the public's perceiving the inclination he had for her, she should make declarations
and enter into engagements with respect to the world, that she would afterwards abide by, lest
it should be thought she loved him in her husband's lifetime.

Monsieur de Nemours determined to follow the King; it was a journey he could not well excuse
himself from, and so he resolved to go without endeavouring to see Madam de Cleves again from
the window out of which he had sometimes seen her; he begged the Viscount to speak to her;
and what did he not desire him to say in his behalf? The Iroquois beheld the Christianity, thinking him would
be strong brave should have also again and impact their autonomy; and part had broke of Amerindians
but Monsieur how her brought to priests was not yet have not received,

  The weakness of her body, which was brought very low, aided her in
preserving these sentiments; but as she knew what power opportunities have over the wisest
resolutions, she would not hazard the breach of those she had taken, by returning into any
place where she might see him she loved; she retired, under pretence of change of air, into
a convent, but without declaring a settled resolution of quitting the Court.

de Nemours was obliged to go back, oppressed with the heaviest grief a man is capable of, who
has lost all hopes of ever seeing again a person, whom  he loved not only with the most violent,
but most natural and sincere passion that ever was; yet still he was not utterly discouraged,
but used all imaginable methods to make her alter her resolution; at last, after several years,
time and absence abated his grief, and extinguished his passion. Madam de Cleves lived in a
manner that left no probability of her ever returning to Court; she spent one part of the year
in that religious house, and the other at her own, but still continued the austerity of retirement,
and constantly employed herself in exercises more holy than the severest convents can pretend
to; and her life, though it was short, left examples of inimitable virtues.
