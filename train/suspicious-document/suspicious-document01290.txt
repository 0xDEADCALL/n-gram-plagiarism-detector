RALPH GURNEY'S OIL SPECULATION.

CHAPTER I.

THE "CHUMS."

The puffing, panting engine that dragged the long train of heavy cars into the busy little
city of Bradford, in the State of Pennsylvania, one day last summer, witnessed through its
one white, staring eye, sometimes called the head-light, many happy meetings between waiting
and coming friends; but none was more hearty than that between two college mates--one who had
graduated the year previous, and the other who hoped to carry off the honors at the close of
the next term.

"Here at last!" exclaimed George Harnett, as he met his old chum with a hearty clasp of the
hand. "In this case, if the hope had been much longer deferred, the heart would indeed have
been sick."

"It was thoughtless in me, old fellow, not to have sent you word when I concluded to remain
at home two days longer, but the fact of the matter is that I did not think you would be at
the depot to meet me, but would let me hunt you up, for I suppose you do have some kind of
an office."

"Yes," laughed the young man, "I have an office; but since my work just now is several miles
from here, I am seldom at home, and was obliged to come for you, or run the chance of having
you spend a good portion of your vacation hunting for me."

"And are you sorry yet that you chose civil engineering for a profession?"

"Sorry! Not a bit of it! Up here there is more excitement to it than you are aware of, and
before you have finished your vacation, you will say that the life of a civil engineer in the
oil fields of Pennsylvania is not by any means monotonous. But come this way. My team is here,
and while we are talking we may as well be riding, for we have quite a little journey yet before
us, over roads so bad, that you can form no idea of them by even the most vivid description."

"But I thought you lived here in Bradford."

"I live where my work is, my boy, and since it happens just now to be out of town, my home,
for the time being, is in as old and comfortable a farm-house as city-weary mortals could ask for."

"Well, I can't say that I shall be sorry to live in the country--for awhile, at least."

"Sorry! Well, I hardly think you will be, when you learn what I have to offer you in the way
of enjoyment. I am locating some oil-producing lands, in a valley where game is abundant, where
the fish prefer an artificial fly to a natural one, and where the moonlighter revels with his
harmless-looking but decidedly dangerous nitro-glycerine cartridge."

"What do you mean by moonlighter?" asked Ralph, as he seated himself in the mud-bespattered
carriage which George pointed out as his.

"A moonlighter is one who shoots an oil well regardless of patent rights or those owning them,
save when, by chance, he finds himself gathered in by the strong arm of the law."

"I thank you, Brother Harnett, for your decidedly clear explanation. I almost fancy that I
know as much about moonlighters now as when I asked the question, which is saying a good deal,
for you very often contrive, in explaining anything, to leave one even more ignorant than when
he consulted you."

"If you are willing to listen to as long and as dry a dissertation on oil wells in general,
and illegally-opened ones in particular, as ever Professor Gardner favored us with on topics
in which we were not much interested, I will begin, stopping now and then only to prevent my
teeth from being shaken out of my head as we ride over this road."

The two had hardly got out of the "city," and the thoroughly bad character of the road was
already apparent. Riding over it was very much like sailing in a small boat on rough water--always
down by the head or up by the stern, but seldom on an even keel.

"Go on with the lecture," said Ralph, "and while I try to hold myself in the carriage, I will
listen."

"Because of my friendship for you, I will make it as brief as possible. In the first place,
you must know that before oil is struck, the operator finds either a rock formed of sand or
of gravel. This is the strata just above the deposit of petroleum.

"Of course this must be bored through, if possible, and in the pebbly rock there is no trouble
about it. The drills will go through, and the gravel will be forced to the surface without
much difficulty. But when the sand-rock is met, it clogs the drills, making it almost impossible
to bore through. A heavy charge of nitro-glycerine makes short work of this rock, and out comes
the oil.

"Now, this method of blasting in oil wells has been patented, or, at least, the cases for the
glycerine and the manner of exploding it has, and the company, which has its office in Bradford,
use every effort to discover infringements of their patent. Like all owners of patent rights,
they charge an extra price for their wares, and the result is that there are parties who will,
for a much smaller amount of money, shoot a well and infringe the patent at the same time.
These people are called moonlighters, and the risk they run of losing their lives or their
liberty is, to say the least, very great. The lecture-hour has now been fully, and I hope I
may say profitably, employed."

"If it profits one to learn of your friends, the moonlighters, then your lecture has been a
success. But how do you find excitement in anything they do? Surely they do not make public
their unlawful doings."

"Oh, everything save the shooting of the well is done legally, and with many even that is questionable!
The cases are to be tried, and many believe that the owners of the patent have really no rights
in the premises. The owners or prospective owners of the land whereon the wells are to be sunk,
employ me to survey their tracts, and by that means I frequently make the acquaintance of those
people who, for the almighty dollar, will peril their lives driving around the country with
nitro-glycerine enough to blow an entire town up."

"Let me trespass once more on you for dry detail, and then I will learn anything else I may
want to know from observation. What is nitro-glycerine?"

"I will answer your question by quoting as nearly as I can from what I read the other day.
It is composed of:

    Aqueous vapor      20 parts.
    Carbonic acid      58   "
    Oxygen            3.5   "
    Nitrogen         18.5   "

"Until 1864 it found no practical application, except as a homeopathic remedy for headache,
similar to those which it causes. In that year, Alfred Nobel, a Swede, of Hamburg, began its
manufacture on a large scale, and, though he sacrificed a brother to the terrible agent he
had created, he persevered until in its later and safer forms nitro-glycerine has come into
wide use and popularity. It is a clear, oily, colorless, odorless, and slightly sweet liquid,
and can, with safety, only be poured into some running stream if one wishes to be rid of it.
Through the pores of the skin, or in the stomach, even in small quantities, this oil causes
a terrible headache and colic, while headaches also result from inhaling the gases of its combustion.
It has thirteen times the force of gunpowder, exploding so much more suddenly than that agent
does, that in reality it is much more powerful, and it is this same rapid explosive power that
prevents it from being used in fire-arms."

"You would make a first-rate professor, George," said Ralph, laughing, "and you may refer to
me in case you should desire to procure such a position. Now I think I am armed with sufficient
knowledge to be able to meet your oily friends, the moonlighters, and have some idea of what
they mean when they speak."

"If I am not mistaken we shall meet some of them very soon, without trying hard; but if we
do not, I will take you to one of their cabins as soon as we may both feel inclined to go."

"Don't think that I have come here to spend my vacation simply with the idea that I am at liberty
to make drafts at sight on your time," replied Ralph, as an unusually rough portion of the
road necessitated his exerting all his strength to prevent being thrown out of the wagon. "I
intend to be of every possible assistance to you, and when I cannot do that, if you are still
obliged to labor, I will extract no small amount of enjoyment out of your farm-house and its
surroundings. But at any time that you have a few hours to spare, I will be only too well pleased
to meet with any adventure, from nitro-glycerine blasts to the perils of trout-fishing."

By this time the conversation ceased, owing to Ralph's interest in the scenery around him,
and the curious combination of oil-tanks and derricks with which the landscape was profusely
dotted. From Bradford to Sawyer the road winds along at the base of the hills through a lovely
valley, that seems entirely given over to machinery for the production and storage of oil.
On every hand are the tall, unsightly constructions of timber that form the derricks, looking
not unlike enormous spiders, as they stand on the sides of the mountains or in the ravines,
while the network of iron pipes, through which the oil is forced by steam-pumps from the wells
to Jersey City, are fitting webs for such spiders.

Huge iron tanks, capable of holding from twenty to forty thousand barrels of oil, dot the valley
quite as thickly as do the blots of ink on a school-boy's first composition, and form storage
places for this strange product of earth, when the supply is greater than the demand. It is
truly a singular scene, and he who visits this portion of the country for the first time cannot
rid himself of the impression that he has, by some mysterious combination of circumstances,
been transported to some remote and unknown portion of the globe.

George, to whom this scene was perfectly familiar, did not seem inclined to allow his friend
to remain in silent wonder, for he persisted in supplying him with a fund of dry detail, which
effectually prevented any indulgence of day-dreams.

Although Ralph would have preferred to gaze about him in silence, George told him of the Pipe-Line
Company, who owned the greater portion of the huge iron receptacles for oil; who also owned
the network of iron pipes, through which they forced the oil to the market at a charge of twenty-five
cents per barrel.

He also told him that this company connected the main line of pipes with each tank owned by
the oil producers, supplying a small steam-pump at each connection, and, at stated times, drew
off from private tanks the oil. He even went into the particulars of the work, explaining how
each man could tell exactly the number of barrels the company had taken from his tank by measuring
the depth of the oil before and after the drawing-off process.

Then he described how these huge receptacles were frequently struck by lightning, setting fire
to the inflammable liquid, and causing consternation everywhere in the valley; of the firing
of solid shot into the base of the tanks to make a perforation that would allow the oil to
run off, and of the loss of property and danger of life attending such catastrophes.

So much of dry detail or interesting particulars of the oil business had the young engineer
to tell, that he had hardly finished when the horses turned sharply into a narrow road, over
which the trees formed a perfect archway, that led to just such a farm-house as suggests by
outside appearance all the good things and comforts of life.

"This is to be home to you for a while," said George, breaking off abruptly in his dissertation
on the price and quality of oil, in which Ralph was not very much interested, "and I can safely
guarantee it to be a place which you will be sorry to leave after once knowing it."

"It certainly does not seem to be a place around which anything exciting can be found," thought
Ralph; but, since it was only rest from study he was in search of, he was content with that
which he saw.

CHAPTER II.

A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.

Ralph Gurney was one who thoroughly enjoyed everything in which pleasure could be found, and
even while George was caring for his horses, of which he was very fond, Ralph had already begun
a survey of the farm on which he was to spend his vacation.

The cattle, poultry, horses, dogs, and even the cat, had received some attention from him,
and he was on his way to the sheep-pasture near by to make the acquaintance of the woolly members
of the flock, when the sharp ping of a bullet was heard as it whistled by his head, while,
a second later, the report of a rifle rang out sharply.

There was something so entirely unexpected and so thoroughly startling in this mode of salutation
in so peaceful a place, that Ralph leaped two or three feet in his fright, and at the same
time saw the hole in the brim of his hat, which showed how near the deadly missile had come to him.

Almost any one would be alarmed at such a visitor, even though he might have been expecting
this attention, and Ralph came very near trembling with fear as he realized how narrow had
been his escape from death.

He looked quickly around to see who was using him as a target; but no one was in sight. The
sheep had been quite as much startled by the report as he had by the proximity of the bullet;
therefore, there was no reason to suspect that they had had anything to do with this decided
frightening of the new boarder.

Ralph was on the point of calling out to George for an explanation of this apparently reckless
shooting, when a voice from amid a small clump of trees shouted:

"Hold out your hat and I will put a bullet through the center of it."

Even if Ralph had not been angry because of the danger he had been forced to run, he would
not have accepted any such cheerful invitation, and, instead of replying, he looked carefully
around in search of the speaker.

"Hold out your hat, and I will show you what I can do," continued the voice, while its owner
persistently remained hidden.

"I don't know who you are," said Ralph, speaking sharply; "but from what I have already seen
of your reckless shooting, I consider it to be some one's duty to teach you how to handle fire-arms."

"And you propose to do it, eh?" was the question, as a boy eighteen or nineteen years of age,
with a face that was the perfect picture of good humor, walked out of the thicket. On his shoulder
he carried a rifle, and in his left hand some partridges and a fox-skin. "That was a nasty
shave for you," he continued, in a half-apologetic tone; "but, you see, I hadn't any idea there
was any one around. Farmer Kenniston is down on the meadow, and Harnett went to town this morning;
so you see that, by rights, you ought not have been here."

"And because, in your opinion, I should have been somewhere else, you concluded to send me
away by the most certain and effectual method?" asked Ralph, having by no means subdued his
anger, although it was vanishing quite rapidly before the pleasant tone and face of the boy
who had come so near killing him.

"Well, you see, I didn't know you or any one else was within a mile of the place. I had a charge
left in my rifle, and I wanted to see if I could knock a knot out of that second board in the
barn. Just as I pulled the trigger, you came from behind the shed, and then I couldn't call
the bullet back. I am sorry that I startled you so, and I was in hopes you would hold out your
hat, so that you could have seen how handy I am with a rifle, which would have made you feel
easier."

"I must confess that I can't understand how I could be soothed by any proof of your skill as
a marksman," replied Ralph, with a smile, his anger now almost completely gone. "Of course,
I know that you didn't intend to shoot so near me; but in the future I advise you to empty
your rifle before you come so near to a house."

"But I have wanted to put a bullet into that knot from the trees back there ever since I have
been here, and now let's see if I struck it fairly."

As if he considered that he had made all necessary apologies for the shot which had startled
Ralph, the boy started towards the barn, and in another instant he was pointing triumphantly
to the offending knot in the board, which had been completely shattered by the bullet.

"There!" he cried. "Harnett said I couldn't hit it from that dead pine tree, and that even
if I did succeed in hitting it, I couldn't split it. Now we'll see what he has got to say to that."

Ralph had nothing to say as to the argument between his friend and the stranger, and in the
absence of anything else to say, he asked:

"Do you live here?"

"I am living here just now, and shall for some weeks longer, I suppose. You are Ralph Gurney,
whom Harnett has been expecting, I fancy?"

"Yes; but if George has told you who I am in advance of my coming, he has not been so liberal
to me in regard to yourself."

"That probably arose from the fact that I am no one in particular, while, on the contrary,
you are to become one of the particularly bright and shining lights in the medical world. I
am only Bob Hubbard."

Who Bob Hubbard might be Ralph had no idea; but even though the young gentleman spoke of himself
in such a deprecating way, it was easy to see that he did not consider himself of slight consequence
in the world. He was a bright, jovial, generous looking boy, with a certain air about him which
made the shot, fired so dangerously near Ralph, seem just such a reckless act as might be expected
of him.

"Do you like hunting and fishing?" he asked, after he found that Ralph was not disposed to
say anything about the profession of medicine he had chosen, and which George had evidently
spoken of.

"Indeed I do," was the decided reply. "Is there much sport around here?"

"All you want. I have only been out about two hours, and I have got these," he said, as he
held up his game. "And as for fishing, you can catch trout until your arms ache--providing
they bite rapidly enough."

"Indeed!" replied Ralph, dryly. "I fancy I have seen as good almost anywhere. Do you go fishing
very often?"

"Nearly every day."

"Then, if George has any business to attend to this afternoon, suppose you and I see if the
fish will bite fast enough to make our arms ache pulling them in."

Bob hesitated in what Ralph thought a very peculiar way, and said, after a pause of some moments:

"I'd like to, but I have an important engagement this afternoon, and I hardly see how I can
arrange it."

There was certainly nothing singular in his not being at liberty to accept the proposition
made so suddenly, and Ralph would have thought his refusal the most natural thing in the world
had it not been for his evident embarrassment when none seemed reasonable. However, the young
pleasure-seeker attached no importance to what seemed like singular behavior on the part of
this newly-made acquaintance, and was about to make another proposition for a fishing excursion,
when Harnett suddenly made his appearance.

"Hello, Bob!" he cried, "you've been making the acquaintance of my chum, have you?"

"Yes, after a fashion. I fired at that knot in the barn you said I couldn't hit from the pine
tree, and came near putting a bullet through his head. But I hit the knot, and what's more,
I split it."

"And here is a hole in the brim of my hat, to prove that he did fire at it," said Ralph, laughing,
as he held up his perforated hat to display the mark of the bullet.

Harnett looked with no small degree of alarm at the evidence of Bob's shooting, and said, sternly:

"I think it is quite time that you became a trifle more careful with your fire-arms, Bob. You
have already had several narrow escapes, and will end by killing some one, if you don't stop
shooting at every promising mark you see."

"I'm not half as careless as I might be," said Bob, earnestly. "This is the first time that
I have ever really come near hurting any one."

"What about the time when you came near hitting Farmer Kenniston, and killed a lamb? Have you
forgotten the untimely death of Mrs. Kenniston's favorite duck, or your adventure with the
red calf in the pasture?"

"Oh, those don't count--at least none except the lamb scrape are worth talking about, Harnett,
so don't read me one of your long-winded lectures; and, now that I have hit the knot in the
barn, I promise not to shoot at anything within half a mile of the place. I'm going down to
town for a while, and when I get through with what I have on hand, we'll make some arrangement
to show your friend the oil region."

As he spoke Bob went into the stables, and when the two friends were alone again, George asked:

"Well, Ralph, how do you like what you have seen of the moonlighters? Not very ferocious, eh?"

"What do you mean? I haven't seen any moonlighters yet."

"Indeed! You have been talking for the last ten minutes with the most successful of them. Bob
Hubbard enjoys the rather questionable distinction of being the most noted one in this section
of the country."

Ralph looked at his friend in speechless astonishment for several minutes; this careless, good-natured
boy was very far from being the famous moonlighter his fancy had conjured up, and it is barely
possible that he was disappointed at not having seen some more savage looking party, for he
had speculated considerably about these people who explode nitro-glycerine in an illegal manner.

"If I am not mistaken," continued Harnett, "he is going to shoot a well to-night, and I guess
there will be no difficulty in getting his consent for you to be present. Wait here, and I
will talk with him."

George hurried away toward the stables, leaving Ralph in a curious condition of mingled wonder
and surprise that in this very peaceful-looking place there could be found such an evident
fund for adventure.

The gaining of Bob's consent for Ralph to be present at the shooting of the well was not such
a difficult matter, judging from the very short time George found it necessary to talk with
him. When Harnett came from the stable, he told Ralph that the necessary permission had been
given, and that they would start for the cabin of the moonlighters at once, in order that none
of the details of the work might be lost.

While they were speaking, Bob drove out of the stable behind a pair of small gray horses, which
were so spirited that their driver could pay no attention to anything but them.

"I'll see you again very soon," he shouted; and hardly had he uttered the words before he was
tearing along the rough road at a rate of speed that threatened a rapid dissolution of the
light carriage.

If George had any business to attend to on that day, he evidently made up his mind to neglect
it, for he began to make his arrangements for the journey with quite as much eagerness and
zest as displayed by Ralph.

Since it was by no means certain that the well would be opened that night, owing to the vigilance
of the owners of the torpedo patent, George made preparations to remain away from Farmer Kenniston's
all night, taking blankets, food, fishing-tackle and rifles, as if their excursion was to be
one simply of a sporting nature.

"It wouldn't do for us to drive out to the moonlighters' cabin as if we were going to see a
well shot," he said, in reply to Ralph's questions of what he proposed doing with rifles and
fishing-rods; "for, if we were seen, it would be quickly reported in town, and Bob would have
the whole posse of Roberts Brothers' force upon him. Now, there would be nothing thought of
our going out fishing, which fully accounts for my preparations. I have known Bob to wait for
a week before he dared explode a charge, and I don't care to get mixed up in any encounter
between these two sets of torpedo men."

"I don't want any harm to come to him through me," replied Ralph, gleefully, "but I should
not be at all sorry to see just a little excitement in the way of a chase of the moonlighters."

"There is every chance that you will be fully satisfied before you leave this portion of the
country," said George, grimly; and then, as his horses were ready for the road once more, he
added: "Get in, and, if nothing happens, I will show you the cabin of the moonlighters in less
than an hour."

CHAPTER III.

THE CABIN OF THE MOONLIGHTERS.

Bob Hubbard had been away from the Kenniston farm-house nearly half an hour when Ralph and
George left it, but the latter was so well acquainted with the country that he did not need
any guide to the cabin, and could not have had one, had he so desired, for Bob was far too
cautious to be seen leading any one to his base of operations.

It was well known by the owners of the torpedo patents that Robert Hubbard was the most skillful
of all the moonlighters, and whenever he was seen traveling toward any of the wells that were
being bored, he was followed, but, thanks to the fleetness of his horses, he had never been
seen at his work by any one who would inform on him.

Bob believed, as did a great many, that the firm holding the patent had no legal right to prevent
any one from exploding nitro-glycerine by the means of a percussion cap placed in the top of
a tin shell or cartridge. Several cases were before the courts undecided, and until a decision
was reached, the owners of the patent would do all in their power to prevent any one from interfering
in the business which they proposed to make a monopoly. Therefore, when Bob went about his
work, he did so with quite as much mystery as if he had been engaged in some decidedly unlawful
act.

The ride from Sawyer, among the mountains, was quite as rough a one as that from Bradford,
and Ralph found that he had about as much as he could attend to in keeping the guns, fishing-rods
and himself in the carriage, without attempting to carry on any extended conversation with
his friend. It was, therefore, almost in silence that the two rode along until George turned
the horses abruptly from the main road into the woods, saying, as he did so:

"If I am not mistaken, this path will lead us directly to Bob's headquarters."

He was not mistaken, for before they had ridden a mile into the woods, they emerged into a
clearing, in the midst of which stood a small log-house and stable.

Instead of windows, the hut had stout plank shutters, which prevented any one from looking
in, even if they did prevent the occupants from gazing out, and the door had more the appearance
of having been made to resist an attack than simply to keep the wind or cold out.

The stable was in keeping with the hut, so far as an appearance of solidity went; and as its
one door was closely shut, with no bars or locks on the outside, one could fancy that when
it was occupied, a guard remained on the inside, where the fastenings of the door evidently were.

"I guess we have got here too soon," said Ralph, as George stopped the horses in front of the
hut, without any signs of life having been seen.

"There is a smoke from the chimney," said George, as he pointed to the clumsy affair of mud
and sticks from which a thin, blue curl of smoke could be dimly seen, "and if they are ready
to let us in, we shall soon see some one."

The two sat patiently in the carriage several moments, and at the end of that time the door
of the hut was opened by a young man standing in the doorway, to whom George said:

"Well, Dick, hasn't Bob got here yet?"

"Yes, he's here; but we didn't open the door at first because we were not sure but that you
had been followed." Then turning toward the barn, the young man shouted, "Come out here, Pete,
and take care of these horses!"

In response to this demand the stable door was opened as cautiously as if the man behind it
feared a dozen were ready to pounce upon him, and then, much as if he were unfolding himself,
a tall negro came out, leading the horses away without speaking, almost before Ralph and George
had time to leap to the ground.

"Get into the hut as quickly as possible," George said to Ralph; and as the three entered,
the door was securely barred behind them with two heavy beams that would have resisted almost
any ordinary force that might have been used against them.

The hut boasted of but one room, in which were to be seen piles of blankets that had evidently
been used as beds, cooking utensils, provisions, sheets of tin, tools such as are used by tinsmiths,
and, in fact, as varied an assortment of goods as could well have been gathered into so small
a compass.

In one corner of the room the floor of earth had been excavated, until a space about six feet
square and four deep had been formed, and into this excavation was packed a number of square
tin cans, which Ralph felt certain contained that powerful agent, nitro-glycerine.

Bob was at work soldering together a long tin shell, about six inches in diameter and fully
ten feet long, and he called out, as his friends entered:

"Come right in. Don't be afraid that you will be shot at, for we drop all that kind of business
here for fear we might all go up together. This, Mr. Gurney, is the moonlighters' cabin, and
I am free to confess that it is not the most cheerful place in the world."

"I don't find as much fault with the cabin as I do with what you keep stored in those innocent-looking
tin cans," replied Ralph, as he seated himself on a pile of blankets at a respectful distance
from the glycerine.

"Oh, that's harmless enough so long as you leave it alone!" replied Bob, carelessly, and then
as he resumed his work of soldering, he asked: "Did you see anything of Jim as you came in?"

"No; where is he?"

"Out by the road somewhere. We heard that our particular friends in town had got wind of the
fact that we were going to put in a charge to-night, so Jim is doing guard duty outside, leaving
Dick Norton and I to do the tinker's work. We expected to have gotten our shells all made in
town; but they are looking out so sharp for us just now that it was entirely too much of a
risk to bring them out here."

"How did they learn that you were going to work to-night?" asked George.

"That's more than I can say, unless old Hoxie was fool enough to let it out that we were going
to shoot his well for him," replied Bob, working savagely with the soldering iron, much as
if he would have been pleased had he been using it on Mr. Hoxie's too ready tongue.

"Do you anticipate much trouble?" asked Ralph, with just a shade of anxiety, beginning to realize
that it would not be the most pleasant thing in the world to commence his vacation by being
arrested as a moonlighter.

"That's just what I can't say. We may have it, and we may not; but there's one thing certain,
and that is that I'll shoot that well if I don't get back to the Kenniston farm for three months."

"I don't believe that they are even looking for us. They think we went out of the business
two weeks ago," said Dick Norton, as he, in a very unworkmanlike manner, attempted to aid Bob.
"You see, Jim is nervous, and the least thing frightens him."

"Something has startled him, at all events!" exclaimed Bob, running to the door as a low, quick
whistle was heard from the outside.

Dick, despite the rather contemptuous way in which he had spoken, also appeared to think something
serious had happened, for he joined Bob at the door, looking very serious as both of them quickly
unfastened the bars, opening the door just as a young man ran in from the woods, breathless
and excited.

"What is it, Jim? What has happened?" asked Bob, replacing the heavy bars instantly the newcomer
was inside the building.

"Newcombe and five men have just turned into the path, coming down here as if they knew just
what they should find."

For a moment Bob and Dick were silent, and Ralph had an opportunity to ask George:

"Who is Newcombe?"

"A man in the employ of the owners of the patent, and one who has threatened several times
to secure the arrest of Bob."

Dick's first act, after he fully realized what Jim had said, was to cover the fire, at which
they had been soldering, with ashes, in order to prevent any smoke from escaping through the
chimney, and by that time Bob had recovered all his presence of mind.

"Even if they have at last found the hut, they will be puzzled to get into it, or to get us
out," he said, as he noted the fastenings of the window-shutters, and uncovered a small aperture
which served as a loop-hole through which everything that occurred outside could be seen.

"You ought to have warned Pete," said George, not feeling remarkably well pleased at the chance
of being besieged as a moonlighter, but yet anxious that his friends should elude arrest where
the cartridges and explosive fluid would be sufficient proof against them.

"There is no need of that," replied Bob. "He wouldn't show himself under any circumstances
unless we called him, and from the loft of the stable he can see all that is going on."

Ralph was the most uncomfortable of the party. Not being so familiar with the doings of the
moonlighters, nor acquainted with the general feeling of the public against them, the idea
of being thus hunted like a criminal was very repugnant to him.

It was as if his companions were engaged in some crime, instead of simply infringing a patent,
the legality of which had not been fully tested, and, if he could have had his choice, he would
have been miles away from that spot just then.

"There they come!" exclaimed Bob from his post of observation, and, looking out for a moment,
Ralph saw six men riding into the clearing directly toward the house.

Almost before he had time to regain his seat, and just as Bob held up his hand as a signal
for silence, a knock was heard at the door, as if some one was pounding with the butt-end of
a whip.

No one made any reply, and it seemed to Ralph as if he could hear the pulsations of his own
heart, so oppressive was the silence.

Again the summons was repeated, and a gruff voice cried:

"Open the door a moment. I wish to speak with Mr. Robert Hubbard."

Then there was a long silence, and, seeing the look of anxiety on Ralph's face, George said,
in a low whisper:

"Don't look so distressed, my boy. Those men have got no more right to enter here than you
have to go into another man's dwelling. If they should succeed in getting in, however, they
would find sufficient to prove that Bob was about to infringe their patent; but, as it is,
they have no authority to do anything, although Bob will hardly get a chance to shoot the Hoxie
well to-night."

"That's just what I will do," whispered Bob, who had heard George's remark. "I will put in
that charge if they camp where they are all night."

The men on the outside waited some moments in silence, and then the request was repeated, while
at the same time footsteps could be heard as if some of them had gone toward the stable.

"They might easily batter in one of the windows," said Ralph, as the pounding at the door was
continued.

"They would hardly try that plan," replied George, with a meaning smile. "There are a hundred
or two quarts of nitro-glycerine stored here, needing only the necessary concussion to explode
them. Those men know quite as well as we do how unpleasant such liquid may become, and I assure
you that they will strike no very heavy blows on the building."

It was a singular position for any one to be in, and Ralph was far from being comfortable in
his mind, as he awaited the result of this visit to the cabin of the moonlighters.

CHAPTER IV.

A REGULAR SIEGE.

Ralph, simply a visitor to the cabin of the moonlighters, felt far more uncomfortable than
did his hosts, to whom alone there was any danger.

As the party waited silently for any move by those outside, Ralph had plenty of time to review
his own position, and this review was far from pleasant or reassuring.

In that section of the country the fact of being arrested as a moonlighter did not imply either
disgrace or crime; but in Ralph's home, where nothing was known of such an industry, save when
occasionally a newspaper item was read but not understood, the news of his arrest while trying
illegally to "shoot" a well, would cause as much consternation and sorrow as if he had attempted
to shoot a man. It was far from being a pleasant beginning to his vacation, and he would have
been much better satisfied with himself if he had not made any attempt to penetrate the mysteries
of the moonlighters' dangerous calling.

While these uncomfortable thoughts were presenting themselves to Ralph, Bob Hubbard was standing
on a rudely-constructed table, in order that he might keep a watch upon Newcombe and his men,
and from time to time he whispered to his companions of that which he saw.

"They've got tired trying to find out anything at the stable, and now they're coming this way.
If we keep perfectly quiet they will begin soon to believe that no one is here, and then, very
likely, they will go away."

It was in the highest degree necessary that these men should be thrown off the scent if possible,
and each one in the hut remained motionless as statues, but, as was shown a moment later, their
silence was fruitless, owing to the defective construction of their furniture.

"Now they are gathering close around the door," continued Bob, from his post of observation;
and then, fearing he might betray himself even through the loop-hole, he began cautiously to
descend.

It was as if his very efforts to move without noise hastened the catastrophe he was trying
to avert, for as he started to lower himself from the table, the entire structure gave way,
and he came to the floor with such a crash as could have been heard many yards away.

There was no need of question as to whether Bob's downfall had been heard by those outside,
for at the moment a low, involuntary cry of triumph was heard, which did not detract from the
unfortunate moonlighter's discomfiture. Had Bob cried out his name he could not have proclaimed
his presence any more plainly, and as he disentangled himself from amid the wreck of the table,
his face spoke eloquently the anger he felt, either at his own carelessness or the weakness
of the table.

"It's all up now," said Jim, despondently. "There was a chance that they might get tired in
time, and go away; but now they will stay here until they see us leave."

"Well, let them stay," said Bob, savagely. "I have come here to get ready to shoot the Hoxie
well, and I'll do it before I go home again."

"Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won't," said Jim, doubtingly; "but if my opinion's worth
anything, you won't."

Bob made no reply to this; but attacked the tin cartridges on which he had been working with
an energy that told plainly of his determination; although how it might be possible for him
to do more than to get ready for the work, no one could imagine. He no longer tried to be silent,
but made so much bustle with his work that George said:

"What makes you so careless, Bob? Even if they did hear you when you fell, there is no reason
why you should advertise the fact that you are making cartridges."

"What difference does it make what they hear now?" asked Bob, not even looking up from his
work as he spoke. "Do you fancy that Newcombe, finding us here, does not know just as well
as we do what there is inside here? If we remain quiet, he will say to himself that we are
all ready for the shot, and only waiting for him to get out of the way before we let it off.
If we work, he will know no more, and we may as well take things comfortable."

"It isn't any use for us to try to do anything," said Dick, disconsolately. "Newcombe will
stay right where he is until we go out, and the best thing we can do is give the thing up for
a while."

"Yes," interrupted Jim, "let's go home, and wait until we can give him the slip and get out again."

"I'll do nothing of the kind," replied Bob, doggedly. "I agreed to shoot Hoxie's well to-night,
and I'm going to do it."

"You can't without Newcombe's seeing you, and you know that your arrest would follow as soon
after that as he could get out a warrant," said George, thinking it was high time for him to
interfere with advice. "They have never been able to get any proof against you yet, and you
don't want to give them the chance now just through spite."

"I'm not going to give them the chance," said Bob, calmly. "I am going to take what I need
out of this place while they are guarding it, and without their seeing me. If any of you fellows
are afraid, and want to go home, you know how to get there; but I am going to stay, and do
just as I have said."

Bob could have used no better argument, if he had been anxious to have his companions remain
with him, than when he proposed they should go home if they were afraid. Much as Ralph would
have liked to, he did not think of leaving, when to do so was to be considered proof that he
was afraid, and he, as well as the others, settled themselves down to await the result of Bob's
plan, whatever it might be.

Those on the outside, however, were not as contented in their waiting, as they showed in a
short time, when Newcombe's voice could be heard addressing those whom he believed he had "run
to earth."

"Say, boys!" he cried, "you know very well that I shall stay here until you come out, and the
best thing you can do is to give the job up for a while, for I promise you that you will get
no chance to do the work this time."

It was quite evident that Mr. Newcombe had no more desire to remain outside of the hut on guard
than Ralph and George had to remain inside, and that he was anxious to put a speedy end to
what had every appearance of being a long job. It was plain to be seen that he neither understood
nor relished this singular behavior on the part of those whom he had no authority to arrest
until they had committed some overt act, and that he was anxious to bring the case to an issue
at once.

The others looked at Bob, expecting he would make some reply to the proposition, but he made
no sign that he had even heard what had been said. He worked industriously at the long tin
tubes, neither speaking nor looking up.

"You know that I have got wind of what you are going to do to-night," continued Newcombe, from
the outside, "and you know that I shall stay right here until you leave; so what's the use
of acting so childishly about it? Come right out like men, and begin the thing over at some
other time."

Even Ralph could understand that, in his eagerness to be away, Mr. Newcombe was making a great
mistake in thus pleading with those over whom he could have no control until after their work
was done, and Dick's face lightened wonderfully as he began to hope the "torpedo detective,"
as Newcombe was called, might tire of his watching and go away.

All the inmates of the hut appeared to share the same hope, and Jim at once began to replace
the broken table with some empty boxes, in order that he might have access to the loop-hole.

"What will be the result of all this?" Ralph asked of George, as the two seated themselves
comfortably in one corner of the room, where they would at the same time be out of Bob's way,
and see all that was going on.

"That I can't say. It may be forty-eight hours before Bob gives up the scheme he has evidently
formed, and in the meanwhile here we are prisoners, for we cannot ask to leave the hut until
the others do. It promises to be a tedious thing for us; but you remember that you wished there
might be some excitement other than the mere shooting of the well."

"Yes," replied Ralph, with a laugh, "I remember that I was foolish enough to make some such
remark, and I am in a fair way to get all I wanted."

By this time Jim had built up a shaky sort of a platform, by which he was enabled to climb
to the loop-hole, and he at once gave the result of his outlook to his companions.

"They are unharnessing the horses," he cried, in a tone of disappointment; for he had almost
persuaded himself that they would leave the place at once. "Newcombe's team is directly in
front, and the other two are drawn up on either side, about fifty yards from it. They are preparing
for a regular siege."

"Which is the most fortunate thing for us that could have happened," said Bob, contentedly.

"Why? I don't see how we can do anything when they are all ready to follow us the moment we
show ourselves out of doors," said Dick.

"If you can't, I can," replied Bob, working leisurely at his cartridges, and with as much precision
as if the "torpedo detectives" were miles away.

"Tell me what you intend to do."

"I'll show you when everything is ready, Dick, and not before. You have said that we couldn't
do anything while they were here; therefore, whatever my plan may be, it is better than giving
the whole thing up. Now, if your fears will permit, suppose you take hold and help me while
Jim watches our friends outside."

It was as if Dick understood for the first time that while they were bewailing their fate that
Newcombe should have found their hiding-place, Bob was working industriously at the task on
hand, and he began to help him at once, which employment had the effect of dispelling his fears
in a wonderful degree.

"Three of the men are watching the house from the front, while Newcombe and the other two are
going towards the stable," said Jim; and then he added, excitedly: "I believe that rascal Pete
is talking with them, for they are standing there now, looking up towards the roof as if they
saw or heard some one."

Dick was disposed to leave his work at this startling announcement but Bob's industry had a
quieting effect upon him, and he continued in his office of helper, although with evident mental
anxiety.

"Now they have called one of the other men over, and all four of them are going through the
motions of a conversation. Now Newcombe has taken some money out of his pocket, and is holding
it up in his hand."

There was a moment of silence in the hut, during which all the boys, even including Bob, awaited
in anxiety the result of this evident bribe, and then Jim said, excitedly:

"Pete has shown himself, and is reaching out with the pitch-fork for the money. He is selling
us to Newcombe, who will know now exactly what we were going to do."

CHAPTER V.

BOB'S SCHEME.

From what Jim could see from the loop-hole, there was every reason for the young moonlighters
to believe that the negro Pete, whom they hired, was betraying them to Newcombe, and each one
felt more than uneasy when Jim reported that the detective had fastened some money on one of
the prongs of the hay-fork. But they were somewhat relieved when Bob said:

"If you weren't all a good deal frightened, you would remember that Pete hasn't been told where
we were going. He doesn't know anything more than Newcombe himself does, and if he can make
a few dollars for nothing, why let him."

"But what are they giving him money for?" asked Jim, who was even more disturbed by this apparent
treachery on the part of their servant than were the others.

"For an answer to that question, I shall be obliged to refer you to the worthy Pete himself.
At all events, the only harm he could do us would be to let Newcombe know when we leave here--in
case he don't want to wait--and that is just what I fancy Pete himself won't know."

As soon as the boys realized that Pete had no secrets of theirs worth the purchasing, they
grew more easy in their minds, and were inclined to look upon this giving of money by Newcombe
as a very good joke.

Jim had nothing of interest to report for nearly ten minutes after this, during all of which
time the detective and his men had been engaged in earnest conversation with the negro, and
then he announced that they were returning to their wagons.

They had not unharnessed their horses, but had slipped the bridles from them that they might
make a dinner from the rich grass, and yet be ready for a start at a moment's notice.

After their return to the front of the house, one of the men drove away with one of the teams,
after having received some instructions from Newcombe, and as it was nearly dark, the boys
believed that the detective had sent for food, since there was no longer any doubt about his
having regularly besieged the house.

All this time Bob had continued his work, assisted by Dick, and it was not until the setting
sun had distorted the shadows of the trees into dark images of giants that he announced its
completion.

"There!" he cried, triumphantly, as he laid the last tin tube by the side of the other two,
"we are all ready, and in two hours more we will start."

"In two hours Newcombe and his men will be there just as they are now," said Jim, rather impatiently,
for he thought Bob was assuming to be able to do very much more than was possible.

"I suppose they will," was the quiet reply, "and I should not be very much surprised if we
should see them there twenty-four hours later."

"What is it you propose doing, Bob?" asked George, who, thoroughly tired of the inactivity
as was Ralph, was only anxious to know when their irksome captivity would come to an end.

"I'll tell you. In the first place, how far is Hoxie's well from here in a straight line?"

"Directly through the woods, I suppose it is not more than half a mile. I surveyed the next
tract to it, and I fancy that is about the distance."

"And if we should start from the back of the hut, traveling in a straight line, we should come
to it?"

"Yes; there would be no difficulty about that."

"Then I propose that we simply go out through the back window, unless Newcombe has sufficient
wits about him to station one of his men there. We can, by making two trips, carry enough glycerine
to shoot the well in good style, and by midnight we should be all ready for the work."

The plan was so simple, and with so many elements of success about it, that Bob's audience
testified to their appreciation of it by vigorous applause, which must have mystified the worthy
Mr. Newcombe considerably.

"In an hour from now we can begin work. Ralph, who might possibly have some compunctions about
carrying a couple of cans of glycerine through the woods, where to strike one against a tree
might result in his immediate departure from the world, shall carry the cartridges. Then there
will be four of us, each of whom can carry eight quarts. Two trips will give us sixty-four
quarts, and that will be enough to start the oil from Mr. Hoxie's well, if there is any there."

Bob's plan was quite as dangerous as it was simple. To carry eight quarts of glycerine through
the woods when a mis-step might explode it, was such a task as any one might well fear to undertake.
But the desire to leave the detective on a weary vigil while they pursued their work unmolested
was such an inducement, as caused each one, even Ralph, to be anxious to try it.

The night was not as favorable for the scheme as it might have been, for the moon was nearly
full, and objects could be distinguished almost as readily as at noonday, save when under the
veil cast by the shadows.

This moonlight, Bob thought, would not interfere with their plan, since from the back of the
house to the forest was but a few yards, and unless Newcombe should station one of his men
there, the building would screen them from view.

In case they got safely away from the house, the light would aid them, both in their journey
through the woods and in their work after they arrived at the well.

For some time the boys enjoyed thoroughly the anticipation of fooling Mr. Newcombe, and they
might have continued to do so until it would have been too late to accomplish the work, had
not Bob reminded them that they had no time to lose.

Then they made their preparations for the journey or flight, whichever it might be called.
The long, tin cartridges were tied together securely, with wads of paper between to prevent
them from rattling; the cans of nitro-glycerine were placed by the window, where they could
be gotten at readily, and Bob produced a three-cornered piece of iron, about four feet long,
which weighed twenty or thirty pounds.

"It will be quite an addition to your load; but I fancy you will feel safer carrying it than
you would one of the cans," he said to Ralph.

"What is it?"

And the tone in which the question was asked showed that the newcomer to the oil fields looked
upon this carrying a useless piece of iron through the woods as very unnecessary work.

"That's the go-devil," replied Bob; and then, as he saw that Ralph did not understand, he added:
"It is to drop through the hole to explode the cartridges after they are placed in position."

Still Ralph could not fully understand its importance; but he stationed himself by the window,
resolved to carry the go-devil and the cartridges any distance, rather than take the chances
of being obliged to burden himself with the dangerous oil which the others appeared to regard
with so little fear.

Everything was in readiness for the start, and Bob clambered up to the peep-hole that he might
be sure the enemy were yet in their position, which was so favorable to the plans of the moonlighters.

"They are all there except the one who drove away some time ago, and--here comes the other
now. He had been for food, and they are pitching into it as if they were hungry. Now is our
time to start. They will be at their supper for the next half hour, and by the end of that
time we shall be ready to come back for a second load."

Bob looked once more to the fastenings of the doors and windows to be certain that they could
not be loosened by any one from the outside, and then he cautiously unbarred the window at
the back of the house.

Knowing that the detective and all his force were in front, he spent no time in looking around;
but, leaping out, was soon busily engaged in taking out the cans of glycerine which Jim and
Dick handed him.

Less than ten minutes sufficed for this work, and then each member of the party was out of
doors, Ralph with the cartridges over his shoulder and the go-devil under his arm, while the
others carried a can of the dangerous liquid in each hand.

It had been decided that George, being accustomed to traveling through the woods in straight
lines by his work as engineer, should lead the party, as the one most likely to keep a direct
course, and Ralph had decided that he would remain as far in the rear as possible; for, when
he saw the boys swinging the terrible explosive around so carelessly, he felt that the further
away one could get from that party the safer they were.

George was not as much at his ease as he might have been, for he had not grown familiar with
the explosive, as the others had, and he uttered many a word of caution when they came to those
portions of the woods where the trees stood more thickly together.

Their progress was necessarily slow, owing to the care they were obliged to use in walking;
but before Mr. Newcombe and his friends had finished their supper, the moonlighters were at
Mr. Hoxie's well, where they found their arrival had long been expected.

Mr. Hoxie could understand, from the manner in which the moonlighters had come, that they had
run some risk of detection in getting there, and when he learned that they were obliged to
make a second trip for more glycerine, he offered either to accompany them or send some of
his men with them, as they should prefer.

Bob refused all these offers of assistance, however, for he believed that it was owing to Mr.
Hoxie's incautious remarks that the detectives had paid them a visit, and he did not propose
to run any more risks than were absolutely necessary.

Since four of them could carry all the glycerine needed to make up the charge, and since Ralph
had such a wholesome fear of the dangerous compound, Bob insisted that Ralph remain at the
well, while the others paid a second visit to the hut in the forest, a proposition which Ralph
eagerly accepted, for carrying nitro-glycerine through the woods in the night was a task he
was not at all anxious to perform.

The return through the woods was made in a very short time, the boys walking on at full speed
until they were near the hut, when the utmost caution was used. By making quite a detour through
the woods, Bob was able to get a full view of the watchful detectives, all of whom were seated
on the grass in front of the hut, gazing at it so intently that there was no question that
any suspicion had been aroused in their minds.

Before they had left the hut Bob had placed the glycerine near the window, so that it could
be reached from the outside, and, after it was learned that the enemy were still in blissful
ignorance, but little time was lost in getting ready to return to Mr. Hoxie's well.

Perhaps the boys were no more careless in carrying the glycerine this second time than they
were the first, but they certainly walked faster, and when they arrived at their destination,
they had been away such a short time that Ralph could hardly believe they had been to the hut
in the woods and back.

Everything was now in readiness for the important work, and the question that troubled the
young moonlighters was whether the worthy Mr. Newcombe and his assistants would remain looking
at the empty hut until the charge was exploded.

CHAPTER VI

TORPEDOING AN OIL-WELL.

It is safe to say that Ralph, who was interested in the shooting of the well only as a spectator,
was the most nervous one of all that party who were about to show Mr. Hoxie whether he had
"struck oil" or not.

Bob set about the work with the air of one perfectly familiar with what he was doing, and the
others aided him whenever it was possible, George alone remaining inactive, since he considered
himself entitled to a seat with the spectator.

The well had, of course, been bored down as far as the bed-rock, leaving an opening from eight
to ten inches in diameter and quite twelve hundred feet deep, which was nearly filled with
the water that had flowed in and the oil that had been poured in to give some slight resistance
at the top of the cartridge.

Over this, grim and weird-looking in the moonlight, rose the framework of the derrick, formed
of heavy timbers, and apparently solid enough to resist any pressure that might be brought
to bear upon it. Near by were scattered pieces of machinery, tools and such debris as would
naturally accumulate around a place of the kind.

A large reel, wound with heavy cord, capable of sustaining a hundred pounds' weight, and with
a shallow hook, which would easily become detached when the pressure was removed, was fastened
at one of the uprights of the derrick, while directly over the well was a block for the cord
to pass through. This was to be used to lower the cartridges into the well.

After this portion of the work had been completed--and all three of the moonlighters moved
as rapidly as possible, lest Mr. Newcombe should put in an appearance--the task of filling
the shells was begun. The tops of the long tin tubes were removed, and into these rather frail
shells the glycerine was poured, Bob handling it as if it was no more dangerous than the petroleum
they hoped to find.

As fast as each tube or cartridge was filled it was lowered into the well by the stout wire
bail that was fastened to the top, and just under the cover was the hammer which would explode
the percussion cap when struck. These cartridges were pointed at the head, and since the point
of the second would rest on the top of the first, and the third on the second, the blow which
exploded the first would naturally be communicated to the other two.

It was in lowering these cartridges into the well that Bob showed his first signs of caution
in handling the explosive liquid, for the least jar or concussion, as the tin tubes were being
let down into the well, would have resulted in a premature explosion, which might have had
the most deplorable results.

Ralph, seeing that at this point even Bob was willing to admit that there might be some danger
in the work he was doing, proposed to George that they move a short distance further away,
lest there should be an accident, and the reply he received was not well calculated to soothe
his nervousness.

"If one of those tubes should explode on the surface here, we should stand as good a chance
of being killed a quarter of a mile away, as here. So we might just as well stay where we are."

And Ralph remained, although he was far from feeling as comfortable as he would have felt at
a more respectful distance.

"All ready, now," said Bob, as the last cartridge was lowered into position, and the reel removed
from the derrick. "Now in order to honor Harnett's guest, I am going to allow him the distinction
of exploding the charge."

For a moment Ralph thought of what an experience it would be, to explode sixty-four quarts
of nitro-glycerine, and what an adventure would be his to relate when he returned to college;
therefore he marched boldly up to the well, at the bottom of which was such a dangerous agent
ready to do its work. But when he saw the others seeking places of safety from the gases, and
possibly fragments that would follow the explosion, and when he stood upon the platform of
the derrick which afforded so insecure a foot-hold, because of the oil upon it, his courage
failed him.

"It may be a big thing," he said to Bob, "to drop this piece of iron through the hole, and
be the remote cause of such a powerful effect. But if, when I attempt to get out of the way,
my foot should slip, I should hardly be in a condition to care for glory. I am greatly obliged
to you for the proposed honor; but think I had better decline it."

"Just as you please, my dear boy," replied Bob, carelessly. "Just find a good place where you
can see her when she shoots, and I'll drop the go-devil."

Ralph lost no time in obeying the young moonlighter's instructions, seeking a refuge near the
corner of a small tool-house to the windward of the well, and about a hundred yards from it.

"Look out for your mouth and nose just after the explosion," cautioned George, "for the gases
which will come first to the surface are very poisonous."

"All ready!" shouted Bob, as he looked around to see that every one was in a safe position,
and then approached the well with the go-devil in his hands.

There was an instant's pause as the boy stood with the heavy iron poised over the aperture,
and then dropping it, he sought shelter by the side of Ralph and George.

Perfect silence reigned for what seemed a long time while the go-devil was falling through
twelve hundred feet of oil and water; but the time was hardly more than a minute, and then
Ralph, who had expected to hear a deafening noise, simply heard a crackling sound, much as
if two small fire-crackers had been exploded. It had not occurred to him that but little could
be heard from such a distance beneath the surface.

"Look out for the gases!" cried George.

And as Ralph covered his nose and mouth with his handkerchief, he could see a black vapor,
almost like smoke, arising from the mouth of the well.

"There is no oil there," he said to himself, as second after second went by and there was no
appearance of anything save the gases of combustion. He was almost as disappointed as Mr. Hoxie
would have been at finding a "dry well;" for after all his tedious waiting he hoped to have
been rewarded by seeing the "shoot" of the oil.

He was rather surprised that Bob's face showed no signs of disappointment, for he surely must
have wanted to see oil after his dangerous work. But Bob simply looked expectant, with his
gaze fixed on the mouth of the well, and Ralph turned again just in time to see a most wonderful
sight.

From out of the mouth of the well arose what appeared to be a solid column of greenish yellow,
rising slowly in the air like one of the pillars of Aladdin's palace as it was formed by the
genii. The top was rounded, and the sides of this marvelous column, held together only by some
mighty force, shone in the moonlight like a polished surface of marble, while all the time
it arose inch by inch without fret or check, until the top wavered in the night wind. Then
one or two drops could be seen rolling off from the summit, and in an instant the entire appearance
changed.

With a mighty bound the oil leaped into the air, tearing asunder the summit of the derrick
as if it had been of veriest gossamer, dashing the heavy timbers aside like feathers, and spouting
in the pale light drops as of molten gold.

For a radius of twenty feet around the well the air seemed filled with this liquid gold that
was coming from the very bowels of the earth.

The oil poured out in torrents with a sharp, hissing noise that told how great was the volume
of gas imprisoned beneath the rock, which was sending this oily deluge out, and the question
of the value of the well was decided.

"It's good for two hundred barrels a day!" cried Bob.

And Mr. Hoxie, who would reap this rich harvest, insisted that it would produce very much more
than that.

The damage done to the derrick was not heeded by the owner since the destructive agent was
worth just so much money per barrel to him.

After spouting to a height of fully two hundred feet, for nearly ten minutes, the volume of
oil, or, rather, of the gas that was forcing it to the surface, appeared to be exhausted, and
lower and lower sank the torrent, spreading out in a fan-shape as it lessened, until finally
it ceased entirely.

"What is the matter?" asked Ralph, who fancied that oil-wells flowed incessantly. "Your two-hundred-barrel
well will hardly produce as much as you thought."

"Indeed it will," replied Bob. "You don't think wells go on flowing like that all the time,
do you? They have breathing spells, like men. They spout anywhere from five to fifteen minutes,
and then remain quiet about the same time, or longer. You see the gas in the reservoir of oil
forces it to the surface; the escape of the oil lessens the pressure under the rock, and it
remains inactive until sufficient gas has gathered again to force more up. This well is as
good a one as I have ever shot."

Then Bob and his partners began to make their preparations for departure, since, for them to
be found with their tools near a newly-opened well, would have been almost as dangerous as
to have been caught in the very act of "shooting it."

Ralph would have been only too well pleased if he could have waited long enough to see the
second spout, but being a guest of the moonlighters, he could not offer any objection to their
movements, and he also made ready for the journey back to the hut.

Bob had settled his business with Mr. Hoxie, which was simply to get the agreed amount for
the work performed, and was just getting the reel into shape to carry, when the clatter of
hoofs was heard far down the road.

"The detectives!" shouted Mr. Hoxie, as he started toward the tool-house, where, in a very
few seconds, he would be counterfeiting the most profound slumber.

"The detectives!" shouted the workmen, as they sought convenient places for hiding; and the
moonlighters were left to dispose of themselves as best they could.

"Come this way!" cried Bob, as he caught up the reel, which might be recognized as his, regardless
of how he carried it, and dashed off into the woods at full speed, followed by his partners
and guests.

It was a flight which would be presumptive guilt, if they were overtaken, but, under the circumstances,
it was the only course the moonlighters could pursue.

CHAPTER VII.

MR. NEWCOMBE'S CERTAINTY.

Varied and many were Ralph's thoughts, as he followed his friends at full speed through the
woods, and none of them were complimentary to the business of the moonlighters. He had hoped
there would be some excitement attending the shooting of the well, other than that incident
to the regular work, and he had every reason to be satisfied; but he had seen a trifle more
than was necessary to his comfort or happiness, and this race through the woods was quite sufficient
to take the last bit of romance from the business. The work had been done; but if those who
had been heard on the road were the officers, the chances were that they might succeed in finding
sufficient proof as to who had done the job.

Ralph understood fully that by aiding the moonlighters, even in the slight way he had, he was,
for the time being, one of them, and this thought was far from reassuring. Without any reason,
other than to see the sport, he had, perhaps, infringed the rights of those who were using
every effort to protect them, and what the result might be perplexed him in no slight degree.

But one thing was certain, and that was, now that he had become involved with his new acquaintances
to a certain extent, it was necessary for him to continue with them until he could leave without
either compromising himself or injuring them.

Of course, every one believed that the noise made on the road immediately after the well was
shot was occasioned by Newcombe's men, who, having discovered that the hut was empty, had started
at once for the probable scene of operations.

Under this belief, Bob dashed on toward the hut at full speed, never thinking of making any
investigations to learn whether they were correct in their surmises, until, when they were
but a short distance from the clearing in the woods, George called out:

"Before we show ourselves, it would be well to find out whether Newcombe has really left."

"That would be only a waste of time," objected Jim, "for, of course, it was he whom we heard."

"I believe it was," replied George; "but, at the same time, it is well to be sure. It will
only take a few moments longer, and, since Ralph and I have got mixed up in this thing, I insist
that you find out whether any one is there before you attempt to go into the hut."

Bob thought, as did both Dick and Jim, that Harnett was foolishly particular; but, since the
young engineer was so decided about the matter, he thought it best to do as he was requested.

When, therefore, they arrived at the edge of the clearing, the party waited within the shadow
of the trees, while Bob stole cautiously around as before, with no idea that he should see
any one in front of the hut.

While he was absent, Dick and Jim were disposed to make sport of what they termed George's
caution, and this merriment caused so much noise that Harnett found it necessary to remind
them very sharply that both he and Ralph, without any interest, other than curiosity in the
matter, and after they had been of no slight service, might be obliged to pay dearly for the
part they had taken; in consideration of which, the least that could be done would be to follow
out this very reasonable request.

After this, the boys quieted down considerably, and when Bob returned, they were thankful that
they had done so.

Bob startled them all, even George and Ralph, by the information that Newcombe and his men
were still on guard in front of the hut, and that, to all appearances, they had not left the
stations they were occupying when the party started out to shoot Mr. Hoxie's well.

If this was the case, who, then, was the party that had disturbed them at the completion of
their work? This was the question that agitated them decidedly, and they were beginning a very
animated discussion on the subject, when George said:

"It can make no particular difference just at this moment who they were. Some one was coming,
probably other torpedo detectives, and we ran away. Newcombe and his men are still here on
guard. Now the most important thing for us to do is to get into the hut as quickly and silently
as possible, and if those others were detectives, perhaps our friend, Mr. Newcombe, will be
able to swear that we have not been outside during the night."

There could be no answer to such an argument as this, save in action, and each one started
for the hut, Dick and Jim feeling decidedly ashamed of the sport they had made of George's
excess of caution.

To enter the building silently was as easy as to leave it, and in five minutes more the party
were inside, with the shutters of the back window carefully barred.

Then they gave way without restraint to their mirth at having accomplished their work, while
Newcombe watched their hut for them, and they might have continued at this amusing occupation
during the remainder of the night, if sounds from the outside had not told them that other
visitors were arriving.

"Now we shall find out who it was that disturbed us," said Bob, gleefully, as he clambered
upon the improvised platform, that he might see what was going on outside from the peep-hole.

The boys, believing as Bob did, that these newcomers were the same ones whose arrival at Mr.
Hoxie's lately-opened well was the cause of their hasty flight, awaited expectantly the result
of Bob's survey.

"Three men are riding up," said Bob, "and now they are stopping their horses as Newcombe goes
toward them. They all appear to be talking excitedly, and every few seconds Newcombe points
this way. Now they are coming right toward the door."

There was no longer any need for Bob to describe the proceedings, for the noise made by the
carriage could be plainly heard by all as it came toward the house, and in a very few moments
even the conversation of the men could be distinguished.

"The well had just been shot as we got there," one of the newcomers could be heard to say,
"and you know that Bob Hubbard was to do the work. You have allowed the boy to fool you, Newcombe,
and while you have been here, he has been working at Hoxie's."

"But I tell you that I heard him in here early in the afternoon, and the darkey told me his
team was in the stable. Now, how could he have gotten the glycerine or cartridges out of here
while six of us have been on duty all the time?"

And from the tone of Newcombe's voice it was easy to understand that he was very angry with
these colleagues of his for doubting his ability to watch three boys.

"Are you certain it was Bob whom you heard?" asked the first speaker. "He may have left some
one here, and been at Hoxie's before you arrived."

"I am certain there was some one here," said Newcombe, speaking less decidedly than before,
"and I would be willing to bet everything I own that it was Bob Hubbard."

"Betting is a very bad way to settle disputes, Mr. Newcombe," said Bob, laughingly, shouting
so that every one outside could hear his voice, "and I would advise you to give it up in the
future; but in this particular case you would win the money."

"There! What did I tell you?" cried the detective to his visitors; and it is very probable
that just at that moment he looked upon Bob as a true friend.

"Yes, Bob is there," said the man, reluctantly; "but Jim and Dick were at the well."

"Here's Dick!" shouted that young gentleman; "and when you two want to hold an animated conversation
about either one of us, try not to start it at night, nor so near the door of a sleeping-room
as to disturb those who may need a little rest."

"And here is Jim!" shouted that young moonlighter. "So now that you know we are here, where
Brother Newcombe has been watching for the last dozen hours, suppose the whole posse of you
drive back to Bradford, where you belong."

For a moment there was a profound silence outside, as if this last astute detective was too
much surprised to be able to speak, and then Mr. Newcombe burst into an uncontrollable fit
of triumphant laughter. He knew that it was impossible for any number of boys to fool him,
and very likely he almost pitied his brother-detective for being so simple.

From the sounds, the boys judged that the men were moving away from the hut, and Bob once more
had access to the peep-hole as a point of observation.

"They are harnessing their horses now," he said, after he had looked out a few moments, "and
I guess Newcombe has convinced his friend that we must have been innocent of the shooting of
Hoxie's well."

"The question among them now will be as to who the other moonlighters are," laughed Dick.

And all of them found no little cause for merriment in the idea of Newcombe and his friends
pursuing these imaginary moonlighters.

"They have started for the stable again," continued Bob. "I suppose they want to make sure
that there is no chance for us to get the horses out by any way other than the front door.
What muffs they are not to think how easy it would be for us to do just as we did! They have
walked entirely around the stable, and are now coming back again."

It was evident that Mr. Newcombe's friend needed some further proof to assure himself that
it was not the boys whom he had disturbed, for Newcombe said, as he came near the hut:

"Bob, I don't suppose you have any especial love for any of us, but you know that what we are
doing is all fair in the way of business, and nothing as especially against you. Now, just
as a favor to me, I want you to tell us what we have done since we came here."

It was apparent to Bob, as it was to all in the hut, that the question was asked simply to
convince the newcomers that the boys could not have left the hut during the night, and Bob,
after having descended from his perch, in order that his voice might not betray the fact that
he had been on the lookout, answered, readily:

"I didn't know that you had been doing much of anything. You paid Pete for some information
which could hardly have been worth the money, and passed it up to him on the hay-fork, for
he wouldn't open the door to you. Then you sent one of your party somewhere for food, and since
you had your supper, you have amused us by sitting in front of the hut. Is that enough?"

"Plenty, and thank you!" was the reply, made in such a cheery tone that there was no question
but that it had been sufficiently convincing.

Then Bob scrambled upon his rather shaky perch once more, in order to give full information
to his companions of the movements of those outside.

He reported from time to time as to what they were doing in the way getting their teams ready,
looking around the premises, but without taking more than a casual glance at the rear of the
house, however, and then he said:

"Now they are getting into their wagons. Now they are driving out on the road, and now," he
added, as he leaped down with a loud shout, "they have disappeared to find the parties who
shot the Hoxie well, perfectly content that we could have had no hand in the business, since
it is a certainty in Newcombe's mind that we have not left the hut since he drove up here.
Hurrah for Bob Hubbard's scheme, and Newcombe's belief in his own ability as a detective!"

CHAPTER VIII.

NEW QUARTERS.

Until nearly daylight the boys remained awake, laughing over Newcombe's credulity, or congratulating
each other on the success of that night's work, and then Bob, who for half an hour had been
studying some plan, said:

"It isn't best for us to spend all our time laughing at Newcombe, or we may find out that he's
smarter than we give him credit of being. If we expect to shoot any more wells in this vicinity,
we must change our quarters, for we can safely count on this being watched."

"What if it is?" cried Dick, their success having made him very bold. "Wasn't it watched to-night,
and didn't we shoot the Hoxie well in spite of them all?"

"Yes, we fooled Newcombe well; but we might find it difficult to do so the second time. Then
again, all our work would not be as convenient to the hut as this was, and if it had been necessary
for us to get our horses out, you must admit that Newcombe had us very foul."

And Bob, while he felt thoroughly elated by their victory, did not want that his partners should
come to believe that all difficulties could be surmounted as readily.

"But what do you mean about changing our quarters?" asked Jim, who looked upon their hut as
something particularly convenient and well located.

"I mean that we have got to build another shanty somewhere, if we can't find one ready-made."

"Nonsense! there's no more use of our leaving this place than there is of our trying to fly!"
said Dick. "I ain't afraid that Newcombe will come here again very soon."

"But I know he will," persisted Bob. "Just as soon as he suspects that we are about to do any
work, he will have so many men around here that we can't show our noses out of doors without
being seen. You think I'm right, don't you, Harnett?"

"Well, now, see here," replied George, with a laugh, "I think Ralph and I have had all the
moonlighting that is good for us, without going still further by aiding and abetting you with
advice."

"But you can tell us what you think," persisted Bob.

"Well, I suppose I may venture that far, after having participated in the shooting of the Hoxie
well. I don't think that this place is safe for you any longer, and if I was a member of this
firm, I should move everything from here as soon as possible."

It was plain to be seen that Dick and Jim had great faith in Harnett's advice on any subject,
for as soon as he had spoken all argument was at an end, and, after a brief pause, Dick asked:

"But where could we go?"

"I think I know of a place as good as this, about five miles up the valley, where by working
a couple of days we could fix things up as well as we have them here."

"Then let's see to it at once," said Jim, who thought, if they were obliged to move, the sooner
the disagreeable job was over the better.

"I'm ready to start now, if George and Gurney will help us," replied Bob, quietly.

"If we will help you!" echoed George. "You believe in using your friends for your benefit,
don't you?"

"Well, in this case, it seems as if you might be of great assistance to us, and yet not do
very much violence to your own feelings. You know as well as I do that the chances are Newcombe
or his men are or will be scouring the country to-day for those who shot Hoxie's well. Now,
if Dick, Jim and I start out alone, and they see us driving about the country where we presumably
have no business, they will follow us, and good-by to our chances of getting settled very soon.
But if you and Gurney will take your fishing-tackle, Pete and I will go with you in our double
wagon, and while he and I are attending to work, I will show you as good trout fishing as you
ever saw."

It was a skillfully-prepared bait, as he intended it should be, for he knew that the two friends
were fond of fishing, and they knew that he was an authority on the subject of trout streams.

At first George attempted to excuse himself on the score of having business to attend to, but
it was easy to see that he wanted to go, and equally plain that Ralph had forgotten all the
unpleasant experiences of the night, in his desire for sport.

"You see, you won't be doing anything in the way of moonlighting," said Bob, persuasively,
"for you will honestly be going out fishing. You need know nothing whatever about what Pete
and I are doing, and since we have a supply of food sufficient to last at least two days longer,
you will have no better chance than this."

Whether George really had any work to which he should have attended or not, he evidently put
all consideration of everything save sport aside, for he asked:

"Well, what do you think of it, Ralph?"

"I think it is just as Bob says. We shan't be doing anything but that which we have a perfect
right to do, and if you can remain away from your business so long, I say let's go."

Bob waited only long enough to hear this decision, and then he went at once to the stable,
where he ordered Pete to harness his horses into the double wagon, in which they carried their
materials when out on professional business.

The old negro did not hesitate to tell his employer all that Newcombe had said to him. The
detective had offered him ten dollars if he would answer certain questions, and, understanding
that he did not know anything which could compromise those who hired him, had not thought it
a breach of confidence to take the money.

Newcombe had asked who were in the hut, and Pete had told him, for he knew the detective was
quite as well informed as he was; but when Newcombe questioned him as to what the boys were
about to do, where or when they were going, he was truly unable to give the desired information.

This was all the detective had received for his expenditure of ten dollars, and the old darkey
chuckled greatly over the ease with which he had earned the money.

When the team was ready, Dick and Jim started out for the purpose of having their horses harnessed,
since they had no idea but that they were to accompany the expedition, but such was not a portion
of Bob's plan.

"You must stay here and get the traps ready to be moved," he said, "for if we should all go,
it would be quite as bad, if we were seen, as if we hadn't George and Ralph with us. Besides,
your horses must be fresh for to-night, for we will hitch them into the torpedo wagon, and
it is necessary that they should be able to get away from anything on the road, in case Newcombe
should take it into his head to chase us."

Both the boys knew Bob was right, and, much as they disliked remaining at the hut while the
others were enjoying themselves fishing, they quietly submitted to what could not be avoided.

Pete put a few tools into the wagon, Bob added enough in the way of eatables to last the party
twenty-four hours, and, just as the sun was rising, the real and pretended fishermen started.

The road led directly back through Sawyer, and on the opposite side of the creek, a fact which
showed how necessary it was for Bob to have some one with him who would give to the journey
the semblance of sport, rather than business.

The horses were driven at a brisk trot, despite the roughness of the roads, and in less than
an hour from the time of leaving the hut Bob turned his horse into what apparently was the
thick woods, but in which a road, that was hardly more than a path, could just be discerned
after the thicket by the side of the highway had been passed through.

Over logs, stumps and brushwood Bob drove, with a calm disregard to the difficulties of the
way, or to the comfort of himself and his companions, until a small hut, or, rather, shanty,
was reached, when he announced that they were at the end of their journey.

"Well," said George, as he alighted from the wagon, "so far as being hidden from view goes,
this is a good place; but I fancy it will be quite a different matter when you try to bring
a load of glycerine here. It would be a job that I should hesitate to undertake."

"We can make the road all right with a few hours' work, and then we will put up some kind of
a shelter for a stable. But just now fishing, not a roadway for torpedo wagons, is your aim,
and, if you and Ralph will follow right up on this path, you will come to a stream, from which
you can catch as many trout as you want."

Taking a generous lunch with them, and wishing Bob success in his work, George and Ralph set
out for a day's fishing, believing that their connection with the moonlighters was very nearly
at an end.

After leaving Bob, neither of the boys had very much to say about their adventure of the previous
night, for it had terminated so happily that it no longer worried them, and the thought of
the enjoyment they were to have drove everything else from their minds.

The stream was as promising a one as the most ardent disciple of Walton could have desired,
and but little time was spent, after they arrived at its banks, before they had made their
first cast.

The fish were as plenty as Bob had promised, and, when the time came for their noon-day lunch,
they had nearly full baskets of speckled beauties, that would weigh from a quarter to three-quarters
of a pound each.

During the forenoon they had fished up stream, and, when their lunch was finished, they started
down with the idea that they would reach the path they had started from just about the time
Bob would be ready to return to the other hut.

On the way down, there was no necessity that they should fish in company; therefore, each went
along as he chose, with the understanding that the one who reached the path first should wait
for the other.

Ralph walked on ahead of George, dropping his line at every promising-looking place in the
stream, but meeting with very poor luck, as compared with the forenoon's work. He only succeeded
in catching four while returning, when he had captured fully thirty on the way up, and, owing
to the absence of fish, or their disinclination to bite at his hook, he arrived at the point
from which he had started, fully two hours before he had expected to be there.

But early as he was, he found Bob impatiently awaiting his arrival, and the moonlighter's first
inquiry was for the absent engineer.

"We agreed to fish leisurely down stream, expecting to be here about sunset," replied Ralph.
"I fancy he is meeting with better luck than I did, and that it will be some time before he
gets here."

"Well, we can't wait for him," said Bob, quickly. "We have got everything so that we can move
in to-night, and I want to be off. It won't do for me to show myself without at least one of
you, so we will send Pete back here to wait for George, and you and I will go on."

"But how shall I meet him?" asked Ralph, not by any means pleased at this idea of leaving his
friend.

"That's easy enough to manage. Go back with me, get Harnett's team, come back here behind us,
get him and drive home to Kenniston's. You will be there by ten o'clock, and we shall see you
at breakfast time."

"But I don't like to leave George, for I promised him I would wait for him here."

"Ah, that will be all right, for Pete will explain matters to him."

And, as he spoke, Bob dragged Ralph along, regardless alike of his remonstrances or his struggles.

On arriving at the shanty the old negro was given his instructions, and without further delay
the two started, Ralph feeling decidedly uncomfortable, for it seemed to him that, in some
way, he had no idea how, he was being forced to take part in another of Bob's schemes.

CHAPTER IX.

THE NIGHT DRIVE OF THE TORPEDO WAGON.

Bob was in such good spirits as he drove along toward the hut he was about to abandon, that
if Ralph had been in the least degree suspicious, he would have believed that it was a portion
of the young moonlighter's plan to separate him from his friend. Although, if such an idea
had presented itself to Ralph, he would have been at a loss to understand how such a separation
could have affected Bob's interest.

Had the young student been more acquainted with the work of the moonlighters, however, he would
have understood that another wagon behind the one containing the tools and materials for well-shooting
would aid very decidedly in allowing the first team to escape, in case it was pursued.

Then again, Ralph did not know that it was against the laws of any town to convey nitro-glycerine
through its streets, and that, in thus moving his quarters, Bob not only ran the chance of
being pursued by the torpedo detectives, but also by the authorities of the town through which
he must pass in order to get to his new camp.

Had George been with Ralph, the two would simply have driven back to the hut in the woods,
and from there to Farmer Kenniston's home. But, in his absence, it would be necessary for Ralph
to follow Bob back in Harnett's team for the purpose of taking his friend home.

However earnestly the young student had resolved not to have anything more to do with the moonlighters,
either actively or as a spectator, he was, by chance and Bob's scheming, aiding them in a more
active and more dangerous way than ever before.

"We shall come right back," said Bob, in a reassuring tone, as he saw how ill at ease Ralph
felt, "and George won't have any longer time to wait than will be pleasant, because of his
weariness."

"Still I had much rather waited for him," replied Ralph.

And then, when it was too late, he began to blame himself for not having insisted on staying
behind as George proposed.

"It is much better this way, because it will be a saving of time for him," replied Bob.

And then he began to tell stories and make himself generally agreeable, in order to allay any
suspicions that might arise in his companion's mind.

In this, Bob was so far successful that when they arrived at the hut where Jim and Dick were
waiting, Ralph had nearly forgotten his vexation at having left George, and believed that no
better fellow or more agreeable companion than Bob Hubbard could be found in all the oil region.

Dick and Jim had not been idle while the others had been away, and everything in the hut was
made ready for immediate removal.

Bob told them briefly of the hiding-place he had found, and then the work of loading the wagons
was begun, Ralph noting with a slight feeling of resentment, that George's team was to be loaded
as well as the others.

The torpedo wagon was already laden with its dangerous load, and Bob showed it to him as a
new feature of the oil business which he had not seen in operation the night previous because
of Newcombe's vigilance.

To all outward appearance it was a long-bodied box buggy, with a much deeper seat than is usually
seen, and with a double set of finely-tempered springs to prevent, as much as possible, any
jolting of the load. When the seat was turned over, working on hinges placed in front, the
peculiar formation of the vehicle was seen. That portion of the carriage usually covered by
the seat, was divided into sixteen compartments, each padded over springs, and formed with
as much care as a jewel casket. In each of these compartments was a can of nitro-glycerine,
protected from any undue-concussion or jolting by the springs within as well as without.

At each end, on the left side of the wagon, rose a slender iron rod, fashioned at the top like
the letter U, which was used as a resting-place for the tin cartridges, and rising high enough
to be out of the way of the driver.

"There are one hundred and twenty-eight quarts of glycerine in that little cart," said Bob,
as he gazed at it admiringly, "and if any one chooses to chase us through Sawyer, they'll take
precious good care that they don't get very near. You see, the officers must keep up a show
of activity in trying to prevent us from driving through the town; but they are careful not
to run us down too sharply."

Ralph had not the slightest idea of what Bob meant when he spoke of officers in the town chasing
them, and would have asked for an explanation then had not the moonlighter hurried away to
get the other teams ready.

It was then dark, and the boys were anxious to make the journey as quickly as possible, for
it was a task about which even they did not feel wholly at ease.

In the carriage Bob and Ralph had just come in, were packed the tools, provisions, sheet-tin,
and such material as made a heavy load, while in George's buggy, was the bedding and other
light articles, which made up a bulky load, but one in which there was but little weight.

After the three teams had been loaded, the house locked and barred as carefully as if the inmates
were yet within, and the stable door secured by Jim, who barred it from the interior and then
clambered out of the window in the loft, Bob called his two partners one side for a private
consultation.

Without knowing why, Ralph felt decidedly uncomfortable at this secrecy. It was true that he
had no desire to be told all the details of this somewhat questionable business, but it seemed
to him as if he was in some way the subject of their conversation--as if he had been and was
again to be duped, and Bob was explaining the scheme to his partners.

It was some time before the private portion of their consultation was over, and then Bob said,
sufficiently loud for Ralph to hear, much as if that had been all they were talking of:

"Now remember. We are to keep close together until we get through Sawyer. Then, if we are followed,
you are to give me a chance to get ahead, and you will keep straight on until you tire them
out, if you drive all night. Ralph," he added, "Jim knows the road and you don't, so I am going
to let him drive for you."

Then Bob got into the torpedo-wagon, Dick mounted the one that had come from the new camp,
Jim and Ralph clambered into George's team, and in that order they started toward the highway,
Bob driving leisurely, as if to keep his horses fresh, in case they were called upon for any
unusual exertion.

The orders Bob had given aroused in Ralph's mind, now that it was too late to make any objection,
the suspicions that his pleasing manner had lulled. He began to see why it was he had been
hurried away before George came.

The torpedo-wagon was the one that the authorities would attempt to capture, if they saw it,
and George's team, being in the rear, would be the one that would most likely stand the brunt
of the pursuit, in case one was made. The other two teams being ahead, could turn from the
road into the woods, at a favorable opportunity, while George's horses would lure the officers
away from the tell-tale loads.

Ralph knew perfectly well that had Harnett come from the stream at the same time he did, his
team would not have been used as a "cover," for he had no desire to implicate himself with
the moonlighters, even if they were his friends, and would possibly have refused to act, or
allow his team to act, any such part.

There was a feeling of positive relief in Ralph's heart when they drove out into the road,
the trees behind shutting out the moonlighters from view. It was as if he had been suffering
from some disagreeable nightmare, and he would have been thankful it was ended if it was not
for the awakening in the form of driving through Sawyer, liable to be arrested at any moment.

"George," he asked, at length, "do you really think that what was done last night will injure
your business prospects?"

"I feel so certain of it that I shall begin to make preparations to leave here as soon as I
finish what I have on hand. I certainly know that I would not employ a man who would deliberately
assist in carrying a large quantity of glycerine through a town, and at the same time drive
in the most reckless manner."

"But you can prove that you were not with the party, and that you knew nothing of what was
being done."

"Yes, I can prove that, if they give me the opportunity, and I am now in the position of a
man who longs most ardently to be arrested, but yet who does not dare to appear too eager about
it."

"I can't say that I want to be arrested," said Ralph, dubiously, "for father and mother would
think I had been doing something terrible; but I would be perfectly willing to stand it if
it would do you any good."

"It is about the only thing that can do me any good," replied George, decidedly; and then he
added, quickly: "But we won't talk any more about it. Let us enjoy this ride thoroughly, for
we have just escaped from the moonlighters' den. I can't say, however, that our troubles are
entirely over; for, by the looks of those black clouds, we shall stand a chance of getting
a drenching."

It was as George had said. The sky, which had been cloudless when they started, was now being
obscured by black, angry-looking clouds, which threatened at any moment to break and pour their
burden of water upon the parched earth.

Had they been riding where no shelter could be found, both the boys would have been alarmed,
for there was every indication of a heavy shower; but since there were houses along the road
in which they could take shelter at almost any moment, they rode on, determined to get as near
as possible to their destination before the storm burst.

George urged the horses along, hoping that they might reach the town of Sawyer before the rain
came; but in this he was mistaken, for, before they had ridden five minutes from the time he
first spoke, the great drops that acted as avant couriers to the large body of water, descended,
and the boys had just time to drive under a rude shed before the storm was upon them.

A vivid flash of lightning, followed immediately by a deafening peal of thunder, was the prelude
to as terrific a thunder-storm as the boys had ever seen, and, as the rain descended in what
seemed to be sheets of water rather than drops, the lightning flashed almost incessantly, while
the thunder roared until it seemed as if the very earth was shaken.

Even George had never passed a summer in this section of the country before, and he knew no
more than did Ralph the destruction often caused by the electric current where so much inflammable
material is stored.

Without a thought of the possible catastrophe that might occur, they remained under their apology
for a shelter, through which the water poured in anything but tiny streams, looking out at
the majestic spectacle, fearing only that the wind might throw the frail shed down upon them.

"Look there!" cried Ralph, as an unusually brilliant flash was seen. "It almost appeared as
if the lightning ran entirely around that oil-tank. I wonder if those are ever struck?"

"It must make sad work if they are," replied George, thinking for the first time of such a
possibility. "In that tank alone there must be fully thirty-five thousand barrels of oil, and
the conflagration would be something terrible."

He had hardly ceased speaking, when there came a flash that almost blinded them as it descended
directly on the top of a huge derrick, crackling and hissing as it came, and in what seemed
to be the slightest possible fraction of time, the air was filled with fragments of the heavy
timbers, while, despite the pouring rain, a sulphurous odor was perceptible.

The derrick had been struck, and its thousand fragments strewed the earth in every direction.

"How terrible!" cried Ralph, as he covered his face with is hands in affright, for never before
had he witnessed the terrific force of the lightning's bolt.

George stood at the door of the shed, restless, regardless alike of the deluge of water that
fell upon him, and of the neighing and stamping of the frightened horses; he was like one fascinated
by the awful majesty of that which he saw everywhere around him.

His gaze was directed toward the largest oil tank in the valley, while it seemed as if some
will stronger than his own impelled him to look at this enormous construction of iron, filled
with its easily ignited contents; and as he thus stood, awed into silence, it seemed to him
that the largest cloud was rent entirely asunder, while from its very center a torrent of fire
was poured on to the tank, from which the flames appeared to leap to meet the shaft from heaven.

In an instant the entire body of oil was a seething mass of flames, while the very rain seemed
to add to their fury. One of the largest tanks in the valley had been struck, and the destruction
threatened every living thing that could not flee to the mountains from the river of fire that
poured out over the shattered iron sides of the tank.

CHAPTER XII.

THE CONFLAGRATION.

The grandeur of the scene upon which George and Ralph looked was indescribable, the slightest
detail of which once seen could never be forgotten.

The lurid flames, surmounted by the thick, black smoke, towered upward as if to meet the lightning's
flash, and then, as the wind and rain beat it down for a moment, the heavy clouds of smoke
rolled down the valley like some funereal pall sent in advance of the death and destruction
that was to come.

"What can we do?" cried Ralph, when the awe which the scene had brought with it gave place
to fear for others, and a desire to avert suffering and destruction.

"We can do nothing," replied George, in a low tone. "We do not even know how to fight the burning
oil, and are powerless to do anything, at least until others shall come to direct the work."

"But we can surely give the alarm and arouse the people," cried Ralph, as he attempted to rush
out of the shed, but was prevented by George.

"Do you think there is any one within two miles of here who cannot see that blaze?" asked George,
as he pointed to the mountain of flame. "We can accomplish nothing, therefore we will remain
here quiet until those who are familiar with such scenes shall come."

Ralph recognized the common sense of George's suggestion even when it seemed impossible that
he could remain idle, and while the two stood outside the shed, regardless of the furious rain,
waiting for those to come who could direct their labor, they witnessed another scene, fitting
companion to the one already pictured.

The lightning flashes were as vivid and rapid as ever, save that the glare may have seemed
a trifle less blinding because of the flames, and there was no sign that the storm was decreasing.
Suddenly, even while it appeared as if a small whirlwind enveloped a derrick that stood on
the hill on the opposite side of the valley, another storm of fire descended from the sky,
wrapping the heavy timbers in flames without shattering them, and flinging angry tongues of
fire on nearly every timber in the towering pile.

For a few moments this lofty beacon burned as if trying to outshine the larger conflagration,
and then, as the heat grew more intense, the small tank at its base became a receptacle for
flames, which, overflowing, poured an angry stream of fire down the side of the mountain, igniting
the various deposits of oil in its course.

In an incredibly short space of time, the valley, which had but a few moments before been deluged
with water, was covered with flames and burning streams, which the rain appeared to feed rather
than extinguish.

Then, as rapidly as they had come, the storm-clouds cleared away, the rain ceased, and the
sun came out, clear and hot, but unable to send its rays through the impenetrable clouds of
smoke which overhung the lowland, and wrapped the hills with a sable shroud.

Others besides Ralph and George had seen the first damage done by the lightning, for, living
where such scenes were not infrequent, they feared, at each threatened storm, just that catastrophe
which had occurred, and a small army of men were already on the scene by the time the two boys
had recovered from the awe which had come upon them with this second danger that was pouring
down upon the valley from the mountain-side.

It seemed a useless, because impossible, task to attempt to check the progress of or extinguish
the burning oil, and yet the assembled multitude attacked it with a will that seemed all the
more heroic because of the well-nigh hopelessness of the labor.

Fastening the now thoroughly frightened horses so that they could not release themselves from
the shed, which was situated on ground sufficiently high to prevent the burning torrent from
flowing around it, Ralph and George threw off their coats and vests, preparatory to doing what
they could to check the course of this servant of man, now become master.

Quantities of shovels and pickaxes had been brought at the first alarm, and, armed with one
of these, Ralph and George joined the others in throwing up embankments to check the course
of the streams of burning oil, in order to hold them confined until the liquid should be consumed.

Then women and children were aiding in the work, for it was to save their homes from destruction
that they labored, and foremost among them ever was George, struggling against the fire-fiend,
as if everything the world held dear to him was in danger of destruction.

Then came the call for volunteers to get the cannon, which were nearly two miles away, that
solid shot might be fired into the tank to open a passage for the oil not yet ignited, and
Ralph was the first to offer his services.

He had already had some considerable experience in artillery practice, and when George explained
this to some of those who were directing the work, Ralph was gladly accepted to take charge
of the guns.

He was a gunner without any artillery, but twice as many men as were necessary started at full
speed toward the town, and in a short time the only two cannon that could be procured, without
going to Bradford, were on the ground, while Ralph was hastily preparing the charges of powder.

It may be thought that it would not require much skill to hit, at short range, such a large
object as an oil-tank capable of holding thirty-five thousand barrels; but since, in order
to send the ball through the iron plates it was necessary to hit it full at the place aimed
for, otherwise the projectile would glance off, it can be seen that Ralph was obliged to exhibit
considerable skill.

While this was being done, the others were throwing up earthworks to divert the course of the
blazing streams, or to dam the oil in such places as it could burn without damage to other
property; and it can safely be imagined that but little time was spent in watching what the
others were doing.

After George had announced that Ralph had had experience in the use of artillery pieces, and
after the cannon had been brought from the town, he was left to superintend the work, a sufficient
number of men remaining near to follow his instructions.

The day was a hot one, and the heat from the fire, together with that from the sun, was almost
insupportable; but, stripped of all clothing that could conveniently be cast aside, each one
continued at his self-imposed task of averting the threatened destruction from the town.

Each moment, despite all that was being done, the flames were creeping closer and closer to
the town, which seemed doomed, and, as the time passed, every one saw how useless their efforts
would be unless the iron tank could be pierced, allowing a portion of the oil to run off before
it could be ignited.

Many were the entreaties to Ralph to hurry with his work; but, fully believing the old adage
that "haste makes waste," he completed his operations with deliberation, only hurrying when
he could do so without running any risk of a failure.

"Be quick, Ralph," cried George, as he came up, smoke begrimed, and bearing many traces of
his severe work. "Every moment is more than precious now; and, even after you begin, you may
have to fire several shots."

"I shall fire only one at each tank," replied Ralph, calmly. "The pieces were dirty and rusty,
and it would have been a waste of both time and ammunition to have shot with them before they
were cleaned. I am ready now. Both pieces are loaded, and you shall see both balls count."

Ralph had been working as near the blazing tanks as the heat would permit, and as he finished
speaking with George, he shouted for those near by to stand back. Already had the weapons been
aimed, and, with a blazing stick in his hand, he stood ready to show either his skill or his
ignorance.

Quickly the crowd separated, knowing only too well the value of time, and Ralph applied the torch.

The explosion was almost deadened by the roar of the flames and the sharp reports of the iron
plates, as they were broken by the heat, but above all could be heard the crashing of the iron,
as the ball, aimed perfectly true to the mark, made its way into the oil, allowing it to spout
forth in torrents.

"Hurrah! hurrah!" burst from the crowd, as they realized that the boy, whose skill a moment
before they had doubted, had done that which would have required hours for them to do so successfully,
and then on every side arose the demand that another outlet be opened.

Ralph was perplexed for a moment, since the other cannon was aimed at the smaller tank, and
he had believed that one opening would be sufficient.

"You will have to put another shot in," cried George. "It will take too long for the oil to
run out of that one hole."

While the crowd were engaged in digging a ditch for the oil that Ralph's shot had let out,
in order that it should not be set on fire by that which was already blazing, the young student
aimed the second cannon.

Again the word was passed for the people to stand back, and a second ball was sent crashing
into the tank with as true an aim as the first.

Then, while all save those who were at work on the dam or helping at the cannon worked at ditches
to carry off the unlighted oil, Ralph made ready for another volley.

Two perforations were made in the small tank, and two more in the large one, which admitted
of such a discharge of the contents, that all hands could hasten to the relief of those who
were working at the dams.

Already was the day nearly spent, and yet the fire-fiend was raging with fury hardly abated.
The trees had long since fallen before the fiery blast; the derricks and buildings of the adjacent
wells were consumed, while inch by inch the oil-fed fire crept nearer the town.

George had paid no attention to his horses all this time; in fact, he had hardly thought of
them until, almost exhausted, he was obliged to rest a few moments, or be entirely overcome
by the heat.

Then the recollection of his team, in which he took so much pride, came to him, and he started
towards the shed where he had left them.

One glance back at the fiery torrent, which even the children were trying to turn from the
town, and he realized how important was even one man's labor in this battle with the flames.

A man on crutches was standing near him as he paused irresolutely, and to him George said,
hurriedly:

"I left a pair of horses in a light carriage in that shed up yonder when the fire first broke
out. Not even one man can be spared from here now, and yet my team must be attended to. Crippled
as you are, you can be of no service here; therefore, if you will go there and get them, and
then drive them to some stable in town, I will pay you well for your trouble."

"I'll see that they are well taken care of, and come back here to tell you where they are,"
said the cripple, as he started towards the shed.

And George returned to the fight once more.

Had the men been working where it was cool, by their very numbers they could have checked the
advance of the flames; but hot as it was, fully half who entered the conflict were overpowered
by the heat in a very short time, or obliged to cease their exertions for a while, as George
had done. Therefore, although fresh recruits were arriving each hour, not one-third of all
the force there could be counted upon as able workers.

It was an hour after George had cared for his horses, as he supposed, that the cripple whom
he had engaged to do the work, approached where he was, by the side of Ralph, strengthening
the banks of the ditch that carried off the escaping oil.

"I went up to the shed," shouted the man, "but there wasn't any horses there, nor carriage either."

"Where are they?" asked George, in bewilderment.

"How should I know?" was the reply, in an angry tone.

And then, before anything more could be said, a shout, almost of despair, arose from those
who were working nearer the town--

"The waste oil has caught fire!"

The oil which had been drawn off from the tanks, through the perforations made by the cannon
balls, had been set on fire by the heat of the blazing stream by its side, and the flames were
moving rapidly toward the two other large tanks in the immediate vicinity.

CHAPTER XIII.

A FRUITLESS SEARCH.

Many conflagrations, caused by the lightning striking an oil-tank, have been known since the
discovery of petroleum; but none had ever been so disastrous as the one of which the reader
has had but an imperfect account.

Forty-five thousand barrels of oil had been consumed or wasted up to the time as narrated in
the previous chapter, and fully as much more was now threatened by the overflow, which had
taken fire, and was shooting forth flames most dangerously near the other two large tanks.

At the first alarm the entire force present left whatever they were working at to combat the
new danger, when George and several of those who, with him, were directing the work, saw at
once the peril to which the town was exposed by this sudden abandonment of the labor which
had been performed for the purpose of presenting an impassable barrier to the angry flames.

It was impossible that the now nearly exhausted workers could prevent the flames from attacking
the two tanks upon which they were sweeping, and if vain labor was spent upon that quarter,
the enemy would, beyond a doubt, gain possession of the town.

To keep the men from neglecting the safety of their homes to try uselessly to save property
which could easily be replaced, was absolutely necessary, and the length of time required to
persuade them to return to the work they had first been engaged in would decide the fate of
the village.

Leaping directly in front of what had almost become an unreasoning mob, George and Ralph tried
by their strength to resist the impulsive dash forward, at the same time that they shouted
at the full strength of their lungs the reason why the work nearer the town should not be neglected.

For some moments it seemed as if they would be trampled under the feet of the frightened multitude,
and then their coolness won the victory over unreasoning fear, as it always will whenever displayed.

The people returned to the more important labor the moment they understood how fruitless would
have been their work in the other direction, and George aided them by his efforts and advice,
while Ralph, with a dozen assistants, began a cannonading of the other two tanks that were
just beginning to add their fuel to the fearful blaze.

The breeze, which, caused by the heated air, always springs up during a conflagration, now
rolled the thick, black smoke first in one direction and then in another, until those who had
not already succumbed to the heat were nearly suffocated, and it seemed impossible that any
one could continue at his work.

The sun had set, although that fact was hardly noticed, since for several hours the heavy smoke
had veiled the scene as with the mantle of night, through which the flames glowed and flashed
luridly.

In the struggle between the men and the flames, first one and then the other gained a victory;
but neither had made any progress.

Ralph and his assistants had opened vent-holes for the oil in the last-attacked tanks, thereby
preventing fully half the oil from combustion, although it was entirely lost.

The female portion of the workers had long since desisted from any effort to check the flames,
and had continued their work by preparing food for the laborers, carrying it to them that they
might not be obliged to spend any more time than was absolutely necessary in getting it.

During all that long night the people worked in relays, that each might have an opportunity
for rest, and when morning came the flames were well-nigh subdued--not so much through the
exertions of those who fought against them, as because of the fact that there was nothing more
remaining for them to feed upon.

By that time a small body of watchers, in order to see that the remaining flames did not overleap
the boundaries set, was all that was necessary at the place where ninety thousand barrels of
oil had been consumed or wasted, and for the first time since the thunderstorm had cleared
away, Ralph and George felt that they were at liberty to go where they chose. Both were begrimed
by the smoke until it would have puzzled their best friends to tell whether they were white
men or negroes, and both were in a very dilapidated condition, so far as clothing was concerned.

The garments they had cast off when the work of fighting fire was begun, had been tossed about,
trampled on, or scorched until they could no longer be called serviceable, and, half-clothed,
dirty and disreputable-looking generally as they were, they started wearily for the town in
search of rest, and, what was quite as important, a bath.

Many times during the night had George thought about his missing horses; but it was not until
he was relieved from all care which the conflagration had caused, that he began to grow seriously
alarmed. It did not seem possible that any one could have stolen them, and he cheered himself
with the thought that they had simply broken loose and run away, or that some one living near
by had cared for them.

A visit to the shed where the team had been left dissipated this first supposition, for there
was every indication that the horses had been taken by some one, since no broken harness was
there to tell of flight, and the door was carefully closed behind them, showing an excess of
precaution on the part of some one, since both doors had been left wide open when George drove in.

"Some one must have recognized them as yours, and taken them away thinking they were not safe
while the fire was raging so furiously," said Ralph, after the survey of the shed was completed,
and George believed such was the case.

"At all events, we will get a bath and borrow some clothes first; then we can soon find out
where they are," said George.

And in pursuance of this plan the boys started towards Sawyer, so weary that it seemed almost
impossible for them to walk.

It was not a difficult matter for two who had worked as hard and done as much service as George
and Ralph, to get all they required at the town, once they arrived there, and the bath had
revived them so much that both were in favor of finding the team at once, in order that they
might get what else they required at the Kenniston farm.

Under ordinary circumstances they could have hired a team with which to search for their own;
but now, with every one in that state of excitement or prostration which follows such scenes
as the inhabitants of Sawyer had just passed through, it was almost impossible to find any
one sufficiently calm to transact the most ordinary business.

Twice George made the attempt to hire a horse, and then he gave up what promised to be a useless
effort, both he and Ralph thinking it better to pursue their inquiries on foot than waste their
time by trying to hire a team, and being obliged to walk after all.

They began the search by making inquiries in town, of any one whom they met, and by going to
each stable or even barn, looking in each place large enough to shelter the team; but without
seeing any signs of it whatever.

Then they started up the road in the direction from which they had just come, and at the dwelling
nearest the shed where the team had been left, they heard the first tidings.

The lady living in this house knew George's team, and said that while the fire was at its height,
when she had come to her house for the purpose of getting food to carry to her husband, she
had seen two men drive toward Sawyer in it. The men were entire strangers to her, she said,
and they were driving at full speed, but whether that was due to the fear the horses had of
the flames, or to a liberal use of the whip, she was unable to say. She described the men as
being young and well dressed, and was quite positive that she had never seen them before.

George's first thought was that his friends, the moonlighters, had taken the horses away, as
a favor to him, and this belief was strengthened when, on questioning the woman closely, he
learned that she did not know either Jim or Dick even by sight.

"They probably came down when they saw the smoke," said George, confidently, to Ralph, "and
on finding the team here, knowing we were at work, have carried it to Farmer Kenniston's."

"I should have thought they would have tried to find us first, so as to let us know what they
were going to do," said Ralph.

"In order to have found us, they would have been obliged to meet some of the people here, and
they probably did not think that safe, even though everyone had so much to attend to."

"But they would have left word with someone," insisted Ralph.

"That would have been as bad as to show themselves. Bob probably wants to make it appear that
he hasn't even been in this section of the country, and if any trouble comes of carrying the
glycerine through the town, he will insist that he hasn't been here."

Ralph was far from being as positive that they would find the horses at the Kenniston farm
as his friend was, but he contented himself with waiting until it could be proven, rather than
to provoke an argument when it seemed that, under any circumstances, they had better return there.

After some considerable difficulty, the boys found a man who, for a generous consideration,
would carry them to the farm in his wagon, drawn by a slow, methodical-moving horse, and they
set out, George's fears for the safety of his team entirely allayed, and Ralph's increasing
each moment.

In order to make sure that the horses had been driven toward the farm, and not in the direction
of Jim's home, George made inquiries of all he met on the road, as well as at several of the
houses.

Quite a number of people had seen the team, driven along at full speed by two young men, and
had noticed it particularly because they believed it had been sent to Bradford to get assistance
in extinguishing the fire.

This continued news caused George to be positive that his horses were safe at the farm, and
in the rapid driving he recognized, or thought he did, Jim's presence, for that young gentleman
was always anxious to get over the road as fast as possible.

But when they had arrived within a mile of Farmer Kenniston's home, they received information
of the team which had the effect of arousing George from his dream of fancied security, so
far as his horses were concerned.

A farmer who was well acquainted with all three of the moonlighters, had seen the horses as
they were driven past his home on the afternoon of the previous day, and he was positive that
neither Bob, Jim nor Dick was in the carriage. The men were young, well dressed, and strangers,
so far as George's informant knew, and he was certain that they had not been in Sawyer, nor
in the vicinity, any length of time.

This aroused all of George's fears, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he could restrain
his impatience until the farm-house was reached, when the first question asked was as to whether
the horses were there.

Farmer Kenniston was surprised that such a question should be asked, for he had seen the team
going toward Bradford the day previous, and, as it was in advance of him at the time, he had
no doubt but that it was George who was driving.

That the horses had been stolen there could no longer be any doubt, and how they could be recovered
was just what neither of the boys could decide.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE PURSUIT.

It was some time before the boys, even with the aid of Farmer Kenniston's not very valuable
advice, could decide upon what course to pursue for the recovery of the stolen property. The
plan which met with the most favor, however, was that they should take one of the farmer's
teams, and follow in the direction the men had been seen to drive, which was evidently through
Bradford. By making inquiries on the road, they might be able to track the thieves and overtake
them, although this seemed hardly probable, because of the start of nearly twenty-four hours
which the men had.

If the trail led through Bradford, they could there notify the authorities, and also telegraph
to the different towns near by; and if it did not, it was decided that Ralph should leave George,
going by himself to try to intercept the thieves by the aid of the electric current.

Farmer Kenniston's best horse, which, by-the-way, was not a very valuable animal, was soon
harnessed into a stout wagon, and the boys set out, having but little faith in the success
of their journey.

George had taken with him all the money he had, which was a trifle over two hundred dollars,
since they might not only be gone a long while, but it was quite possible that if they did
recover the team, they would be obliged to incur some heavy expenses.

Ralph had one hundred dollars, which his father had given him for the necessary bills while
on his vacation, and this he offered to George, in case he should need on the journey any more
than he had. Thus the boys were, as they believed, amply provided with money, and they intended
to follow the thieves just as long as they could track them.

On the road to Bradford, George met two men who had seen the team the day before, and they
drove into the town, confident that the men they were in pursuit of had entered there the day
previous.

Before trying to learn who had seen the horses, George went directly to the chief of police,
told his story, and was assured that before morning at least the direction in which the men
had gone should be made known.

Under the officer's direction, telegrams were sent to different points where it was thought
probable the thieves might go, and, so far as the boys were concerned, nothing more could be
done until the officers, who had been sent out to find some news of the team during the time
it had been in Bradford, should return.

George was not by any means in the mood to remain idle while waiting for the policemen's report;
for the loss of his team, in which he had taken so much pride, weighed heavily upon him. Instead
of waiting in the police office for some news, he insisted on going out to make inquiries on
his own account, and, as a matter of course, Ralph accompanied him.

It is an easy matter in the country to stop at each house and inquire if the occupants have
seen a team pass; but the boys found that such a system could hardly be pursued in the city,
since a gentleman might feel insulted if any one should stop him in the street to ask if he
had seen a pair of horses, attached to a light wagon, pass there twenty-four hours before.

This difficulty had not presented itself either to George or Ralph, until they were on the
street, ready to pursue their investigations, and then they were sadly puzzled to know what to do.

While they were standing irresolutely in front of the police quarters, trying to make up their
minds how they should proceed, George was accosted by a rough, but pleasant-looking old gentleman,
who appeared very glad to see him, and at the same time acted as if he was in deep trouble
about something.

"I am powerful glad to see yer, Mr. Harnett; for I conclude that you've forgotten all about
the promise you made to drive out an' see us every time you had the chance."

"And I'm glad to see you, Mr. Simpson," replied George, as he introduced Ralph to Mr. David
Simpson. "I have by no means forgotten my promise to call upon you, for I spent too many happy
hours while I was boarding with you, when I was surveying the Walters' property, to ever forget
that I should like to go again. I have been at work near Farmer Kenniston's, and have not had
the time to pay you a visit. But now that I shall have more leisure, I will drive out some
day and bring Ralph with me."

"I would be powerful glad to see you, Mr. Harnett," said the old man, sadly; "but it won't
be in the old home, and the good Lord only knows where the remainder of my old life will be spent."

"What do you mean, Mr. Simpson?" asked George, in surprise; for the sadness visible on the
old man's face astonished him quite as much as the singular words did.

"It means, Mr. Harnett, that I've lost the old place I was raised on, and all for the lack
of a little money. You know that I helped poor Tom set himself up in business by mortgaging
the farm. If the poor boy had lived, he would have paid it all; but jest when we thought he
was gettin' along so famously, he died. I've walked the streets of this town all day, hopin'
I could find some one who would help me make up the balance I owe; but the fire yesterday makes
everybody feel poor, I s'pose, an' I couldn't borrow a dollar; so I'm goin' home now to tell
mother that we've got to leave the home where all our babies were born, and where they all died."

The old man could not prevent the tears from gathering in his eyes as he spoke, and both the
boys felt an uncomfortably hard lump rise in their throats as he finished.

"Can't you persuade your creditor to give you longer time?" asked George.

"I've just come from his office, where I begged harder of him than I ever begged of man before
to take what money I had and wait a year longer; but he wants my back pasture to piece on to
his own, and says he will foreclose to-morrow," replied the old man.

And then, as if conscious that he was obtruding his own sorrows on one whom he had no right
to burden with them, he would have changed the conversation; but George prevented him by asking:

"How much did you owe him, Mr. Simpson?"

"Well, you see, I'd kept the interest paid up reg'lar, an' it come to jest the face of the
mortgage, five hundred dollars. I'd managed to scrape up two hundred an' twenty-five, an' up
to this mornin' I'd reckoned on sellin' the wood lot for enough to make up the balance. But
when the fire come yesterday, the man who was to buy it--'Siah Rich--had lost so much that
he couldn't take it."

"Was you to sell him the wood-lot for two hundred and seventy-five dollars?"

"Yes, an' I think it was well worth that. I didn't really need it, an' if I could only have
sold it I'd been all right, but now the whole thing's got to go. I don't care so much for myself,
but it'll come powerful hard on the wife, for she does set a store by the old place, if it
is rough-lookin'."

George beckoned to Ralph to step aside with him, but there was no need of any consultation
just then, for the latter said, quickly:

"I know what you mean, George, and here is all I have got."

As he spoke Ralph handed his friend the roll of bills which was to enable him to spend a long
vacation, and then turned away, as if not wanting to embarrass the old gentleman by his presence.

"Mr. Simpson," said George, as he added his own money to that which Ralph had given him, "between
the two of us we have got enough to buy your wood-lot, and here is the money. Pay the mortgage
this afternoon, and then you can make out a deed to these two names."

George wrote his own and Ralph's name on a slip of paper, which he handed to the old man at
the same time he gave him the money.

"But I can't take this, Mr. Harnett," he said, while at the same time his face showed how delighted
he would be to keep it. "You and your friend don't want my wood-lot, an' you only offer me
this money because I have been tellin' you of my troubles, like a beggar, an' an old fool that
I am. Take it back, Mr Harnett, an' mother an' I won't feel half so bad about goin' away when
we've once left."

"But suppose I tell you that we want to buy the land on a speculation?" said George, with a
smile. "There may be oil there, and we may want to sink a well."

"You wouldn't buy that land if it was oil you were after. One time I did think we might strike
it, but those as know told me there wasn't any there, after they'd looked the property over,"
replied the old man, as with trembling hand he held the money toward George.

"Well, we'll buy the land, anyway," said the young engineer, with a smile. "You have said that
it was worth that amount of money, and we may be able to sell it for more than we paid you,
even if there isn't any oil. So have the deed made out, and leave it for me at Farmer Kenniston's."

Then, before the old man could make any further reply, George walked swiftly on, followed by
Ralph, and Mr. Simpson was left to enjoy the generosity which enabled him still to retain the
home that was made dear both to him and his wife by so many pleasant, and at the same time
sad, recollections.

"Well?" he said, inquiringly, when he and Ralph had left Mr. Simpson some distance behind,
wondering if the good fortune which had come to him was real or not.

"Well?" repeated Ralph, laughing. "I suppose you mean to ask if I am sorry for what I have
done? Not a bit of it, for I can get father to give me money enough to pay for my ticket home,
while, simply at the expense of a little enjoyment, we have made that old man happy. But how
will it affect you, George? How can you search for your horses if you have no money?"

"From the united funds we have twenty-three dollars left, and if that is not enough then the
horses must remain lost, for I would willingly have given them up rather than that Mr. Simpson
and his wife should have been turned homeless into the world."

"If you think that way, then I think we have done a good thing, and we certainly ought to feel
that we are of considerably more importance in the world, since we are landed proprietors.
But we must look at the property before I go home, for I want to see it; and now come with
me where I can write a letter to father, for the longer I stay now, the more deeply in debt
shall I be."

"You're not going to shorten your vacation because of lending this money, Ralph, for you shall
live with me, and the only inconvenience you will suffer will be the lack of money to spend."

Ralph was not so certain that he would become a burden on George simply because he had expended
some money in charity; but just at that moment there was no need of discussing it; and he proposed
that they return to the police head-quarters in order to find out if the detectives had learned
anything about the team.

Greater good fortune awaited them here than they had thought possible, for when they returned
the officers furnished them with the complete description of the men, and reported that they
had, indeed, driven into Bradford the afternoon before, but, during the night, had returned
by the same road they had come, stating that they were going to Babcock.

CHAPTER XV.

THE ARREST.

It was evident, from the information brought by the police, that the men who had stolen Harnett's
team had driven to Bradford simply for the purpose of deceiving any one who might search for
them, and that they would push on into New York State, where they might find a better opportunity
of disposing of their ill-gotten property.

Under the circumstances there was nothing the boys could do save return by the road they had
come, and, since it was necessary to do this, it was as well that they should sleep that night
in the Kenniston farm-house as in Bradford, where they would be obliged to spend some of their
small store of money for lodging and breakfast.

As soon, therefore, as they had received from the chief of police all the information he could
impart, they started toward home, neither nearer nor further from the object of their search.

All that they had done on the way down would have necessarily to be done over again, in the
hope of learning of the thieves on their return, and no time was to be lost in this second search.

Of course, if the men had started from Bradford in the night, there would be no use in inquiring
for them anywhere between there and some distance from Sawyer; therefore, the boys decided
that they would sleep at the Kenniston farm that night, recommencing the pursuit at an early
hour next morning.

When they reached the farm-house they found Bob Hubbard awaiting their arrival; he had come
there two hours before, and when, on asking for George, he was told that the engineer had gone
in search of his horses, had told the farmer that, while he did not intend to remain there
during the night, he would wait for George's arrival, which he was certain would not be long
delayed.

Not knowing Bob's reason for expecting George's return, when it seemed certain he would be
away some time, Farmer Kenniston was considerably mystified by his guest's manner; but the
reason for his thus speaking was soon explained when, at a late hour in the evening, George
and Ralph did arrive.

"I knew you would come back to-night," said Bob, as he rushed out to meet the friends whom
he had not treated exactly as it would seem friendship demanded, "for I knew, if you learned
anything at all, you would find it necessary to come back this way."

"Why, what do you know?" asked George, quickly.

"When I tell you that I knew your team had been stolen even before you did, you must admit
that I know something about it," replied Bob, feeling fully how important he was just then.

"Don't be long-winded now, Bob," said George, sharply; "for you know how anxious I am."

"I'll tell you all I know, and I think I may be able to make amends for the trick we played
upon you in using your team the other night, unless you think it was because of that that you
had your horses where they could be stolen."

"Tell me what you have heard of my team!" exclaimed George, impatiently.

"Jack Roberts told me, this afternoon, that he saw two fellows in your carriage about midnight,
and that they stopped all night, or at least the remainder of it, in the woods just above our
camp. I went up there with him about five o'clock, and it didn't seem as if they could have
been gone more than an hour before we got there."

"Did you find out which way they went?"

"As near as could be told by the tracks, they kept straight on toward Babcock."

"That's where they said they were going," said Ralph, excitedly, delighted at this confirmation
of the policeman's story.

"From the looks of the place where they stayed last night, I should say that they don't know
very much about camping out," continued Bob. "They just hitched the horses to a tree, and laid
down on the ground, with a few boughs under them, instead of putting up a shelter, which wouldn't
have taken ten minutes. I found pieces of newspaper, in which had been food, scattered around.
So I fancy their arrangements for the journey were made very hurriedly and incompletely. I
don't think they had hay or grain for the horses, for I couldn't find any signs of either."

It was evident that Bob had examined the ground thoroughly in expectation of a chase, and as
he gave what was really valuable information, gathered simply from a desire to aid his friend,
George was perfectly willing to forgive him for any and everything he had ever done against him.

"Then we won't stop here to-night," said the owner of the stolen horses, hurriedly. "If they
left there this afternoon, we may stand a chance of overtaking them to-night. You needn't take
the horse out, Mr. Kenniston, for we will start right off again."

"Do you think there is any chance of overtaking your horses, even if they haven't had any grain,
with this poor old nag of the farmer's, whose greatest speed has been shown in front of a plow?"

And Bob laughed gleefully at the idea.

"It is the best horse I can get just now," said George, fretfully; for he could not see anything
very comical in the fact of being thus hampered in the pursuit.

"There's where you are mistaken, my dear boy," replied Bob, in his old, lofty way. "My horses
are as fast, and I'm inclined to think a little faster, than yours. When Jack told me what
he had seen, I thought there was a chance to pay off old scores. So I harnessed into the light
double wagon, put in some blankets, and come here. While I have been waiting for you, I have
got a good-sized lunch from Mrs. Kenniston, a bag of grain from the farmer, and now we are
ready to start, even if we drive to the lake."

"Bob, you are a good fellow," exclaimed George, as he grasped the moonlighter by the hand,
and made a mental vow that he would never speak harshly to him again.

While they had been talking, Farmer Kenniston had backed Bob's horses out of the shed, where
their master had left them, that the journey might be commenced as quickly as possible, and
the boys got into the wagon at once, George and Ralph on the back seat, and Bob in front.

That the chase would be an exciting one, in case they should get within sight of the thieves,
was shown by the way Bob's horses started off, and, for the first time since he was convinced
of his loss, George began to have some hopes of regaining his property.

"There is one danger in our chasing those fellows in the night," said Bob, after they had started,
"and as to whether you will take the risk, you must decide. They will probably spend this night
as they did last night--in the woods. Of course, we could not see in the dark if an ox-cart
had driven into the woods, and we run every chance of driving past them. Then again, if we
wait until morning, we are just so much further behind. Now, what will you do?"

"I hardly know," replied George, after considerable thought. "What is your advice?"

"Well," and Bob spoke like one who has already decided the matter in his own mind, "my idea
is that they won't stop this side of Babcock, and I am certain they won't stop in the town.
So I think we shall be safe to drive as far as there. The chances are that the thieves will
drive through the town in the night, and stop in the first likely place they come to on the
other side. We can start in the morning again, about as early as they can."

"Then that is what we will do," said George, satisfied that Bob had deliberated upon this plan
until he was convinced it was the best that could be done.

"Do you believe we shall catch them?" asked Ralph, speaking for the first time since he had
met Bob.

"Catch them!" echoed the moonlighter. "I wish I was as sure of striking a thousand-barrel well
as I am that we shall be interviewing the young gentlemen before to-morrow night."

But if Bob's hopes of striking a big well had been dependent upon catching the thieves before
the next night, he would never have made a success in the oil region, save as a moonlighter.

"There is our wood-lot," said George, as he pointed to a grove on the opposite side of the
creek, near which a very old and a very dilapidated house could be seen.

Bob was curious, of course, to know what George meant, and, after the story had been told him,
he said:

"It was a big thing for you to do, boys, and Simpson probably appreciates it as much as any
man could; but I tell you for a fact that you will get your reward for that good deed sooner
than you expect. There's oil in that same wood-lot, and I've sort of reckoned on buying it
myself some day. If I had known how Simpson was fixed, it would have been mine before now,
for two hundred and seventy-five dollars is cheap for ten acres, even if there is nothing there
but rocks."

"But Simpson says he has had oil men examine the place, and there's nothing there," said George,
half believing Bob had some good reason for speaking as he did.

"Yes, he had a lot of old fogies there who couldn't tell the difference between oil and a tallow
candle. They walked around ten minutes, collected twenty-five dollars from the old man, and
then walked away. Simpson was probably paying ten per cent to old Massie, for I've heard he
was the one who held the mortgage, and if he could have got half the amount loaned, don't you
suppose he would have waited any length of time if he hadn't seen a chance to make more? Massie
knows the oil is there as well as I do, and the old miser thought he was going to get the whole
farm for his five hundred dollars. Why, the old fellow would choke both of you boys if he could
get hold of you just now."

Bob laughed long and loud at the way in which the money-lender had over-reached himself, and
it is hard to say just how long his merriment would have lasted, since it received a sudden check.

They were then just entering the town of Sawyer, and a man had stepped into the road, as if
to speak to the party, seizing one of the horses by the bridle as they approached him, to make
sure of being heard.

"Hello! What's the matter now?" asked Bob, who had not noticed the man, and was surprised at
the sudden stopping of his team.

"I wished to speak with you for a moment," said the man, as he fumbled in his pocket with his
disengaged hand, and then as he produced some papers, he said: "I arrest you, Mr. Robert Hubbard,
and you, Mr. George Harnett, for violating a town ordinance by carrying nitro-glycerine through
the streets."

George had said he hoped he would be arrested, in order that he might show he had not been
guilty of such a violation, but when he expressed the wish, he could have had no idea that
the arrest would be made just at the moment when, in order to recover his team, it was necessary
for him to be free.

CHAPTER XVI.

PLEADING FOR LIBERTY.

This arrest, coming just when it did, was a complete surprise to George. He had hoped a few
hours before that it would come, in order that he might have an opportunity of showing that
he was innocent of that which was charged against him, simply because his team had been the
one the officers had chased. But to be deprived of his liberty now, when every moment was precious,
seemed to be doubly disastrous.

To be prevented from chasing the thieves when he was at last on the track of them, was to lose
his horses beyond any probable chance of recovery, while to have forty-eight hours of liberty
just then, was, as he thought, almost a guarantee that he could recover his stolen team.

Bob was even more excited by the arrest than George. He had the pleasing thought that he was
guilty of the offense charged, added to the disappointment at not being able to aid his friend
in recovering the property which he was the remote cause of being lost.

He knew, as well as did George, that at the worst they would only be fined for violating the
town ordinance; but it was the loss of time just then that made the matter a serious one, and
he resolved to do his best to secure their liberty for a short while longer, at all events.

"I won't say anything about myself," said Bob, with a laugh, "for I don't suppose my reputation
as a steady young man is first-class; but you, Mr. Constable, as well as nearly every one in
Sawyer, know Harnett, and you know he will keep his word. While he was helping extinguish the
fire yesterday, his pair of horses and carriage were stolen. We have just got on the track
of the thieves, and if we are obliged to remain here now, there will be no chance of recovering
the property. Now, if you will give us our liberty, Harnett will give you his word that we
will return here at any time you shall set."

"That is hardly a regular way of doing business, Mr. Hubbard," said the man, with a smile,
that showed he had no hard feelings against those whom he was obliged to arrest; "and if it
was your word alone that I was asked to take, I am afraid I should be obliged to refuse. I'm
doubtful as to whether I ought to even consider the matter."

"Of course you ought," said Bob, quickly. "Now, if we should be convicted, the penalty is only
a fine, and we can leave you as much money as would be required to pay those as security that
we will return."

"I suppose in that case, and if Mr. Harnett promises that both you and he will come here a
week from to-day, I might take the risk of any accident that would prevent you from appearing."

"Now that's what I call acting squarely," said Bob, in a satisfied way; and George asked:

"How much money will be necessary to satisfy you that we will appear for trial?"

"Well, I don't suppose the fines will be over fifty dollars. So, if you leave that amount with
me, you can keep on in search of the thieves, whom I hope you will catch."

Ralph's heart, which had been very light when he saw that there was a chance they might continue
their journey, sank again when the officer mentioned the amount of security he demanded, for
he knew that the united funds of his and George's fell far short of the sum, and what little
they had would be actually necessary for their expenses on the road.

"How much money have you got, Bob?" asked George, speaking in a low, determined tone, that
told plainly how anxious he was to be in pursuit once more, and of the sacrifice he would be
willing to make in order to be released from the meshes of the law, even if it was only for
a few days.

"I can't say exactly, but I'll promise you it isn't very much," replied Bob, carelessly, as
if he did not think the amount of any great importance.

And, after rummaging in all his pockets, he succeeded in producing one very ragged-looking
twenty-dollar bill.

"That's the size of my fortune," he said, as he handed the money to George, as if the matter
was already ended.

George had twenty-three dollars, all of which he would undoubtedly need before he returned;
but, willing to run any risk rather than be longer delayed, he said to the officer:

"It happens very unfortunately, but we have not got fifty dollars between us. If you will take
my solemn promise that both Bob and myself will meet you here a week from to-day, and also
that I will report to you on our return, together with this forty dollars, you will be doing
us a favor which shall not be forgotten."

The man hesitated for a moment, and Bob said, impatiently:

"Oh, take the money, and let us go. You have got really more than the fine will amount to,
for I promise you that Harnett can prove by us all that he had nothing to do with violating
the ordinance. I simply got possession of his team to deceive you."

"I shall be here when the case is called," said George, quietly; "for I am very anxious to
show that I had nothing whatever to do with the matter; so please let us get on."

"Well, I guess there's no trouble about it, and I don't believe any one will blame me for accommodating
you, in view of all the circumstances," said the officer, as he stepped back from the wagon
in order that they might drive on. "I hope you will succeed in getting your team, Mr. Harnett.
Good-night, gentlemen!"

"Good-night!" cried Bob, as he started the horses with a jerk that nearly threw his passengers
from their seats.

And in another instant they were riding at full speed in the direction of Babcock.

"I hardly know what we had better do," said George, thoughtfully. "Here we are starting out
on what may be a long journey, with only three dollars in our pockets, and I am not sure but
that we ought to go back to town to try to get some more."

"That would never do," replied Bob, decidedly. "If we should do that we could not get to Babcock
to-night, and that we must do, if we expect to catch the thieves. We have got food and grain
enough to last a day and a half or two days, and we can rough it in the woods, as the men we
are chasing are doing."

George would have preferred decidedly to be able to go to a hotel at night, rather than to
camp in the woods; but Bob and Ralph were only too well pleased at the idea of living a gipsy
life, therefore it was decided to keep on, or, more properly speaking, since no one made any
objection to the plan, Bob continued to urge the horses on in the direction the thieves were
supposed to have gone.

The night was not so dark but that they could drive a good pace, but had it been daylight there
is no question but that Bob's horses would have shown considerably better speed, for their
driver was anxious to reach Babcock early, in order that the animals might have as long a rest
as possible, before starting on their journey next day, which would likely be a hard one.

Bob sang, laughed, and acted generally as if he was in the best of spirits, while Ralph joined
in with him, for he enjoyed this night-drive immensely; but George remained silent, his great
desire to get on faster causing the speed at which they were traveling to seem very slow.

It was some time past midnight when they arrived at Babcock, and much as they liked to camp
out, both Ralph and Bob would have been better satisfied, just then, if they could have remained
all night at the hotel, for they were so tired that sleeping in the open air had not as many
charms for them as usual.

"Here's where we would have stopped if we had not been obliged to give up all our money," said
Bob, as they drove past the hotel. "But now that we are nothing more nor less than three-dollar
paupers, we shall be obliged to do as the thieves are probably doing--make up our bed under
the greenwood, or some other kind of a tree."

"It might be worse," said George, who was beginning to recover some of his cheerfulness as
his companions lost theirs, "and we will stop at the next clump of trees."

"There will be no doubt about our finding accommodations," laughed Bob, "unless our friends
who are the cause of this excursion have engaged all the promising-looking groves."

Above half a mile from the town the road ran through a piece of dense woods, which shut out
even the faint rays of the moon, and Bob stopped the horses, while George and Ralph explored,
as well as possible in the darkness, for a chance to make a camp.

A small, open space, surrounded by bushes, about ten yards from the road, was the best place
they could find, and preparations for the night began at once.

The horses were unharnessed and the carriage backed in among the trees, where it would not
be seen by any one who might pass during the night.

The horses were fastened to a couple of trees, where they could feed without danger of getting
their halters entangled among the bushes, and each was given a generous supply of grain.

Among other things which Bob had placed into the carriage while waiting at the Kenniston farm
was a water-pail, and with this on his arm he started out in search of water for the horses,
while George and Ralph attended to the making of what could only be an apology for a camp.

The blankets, cushions and rug were taken from the carriage, and were spread on the ground
over a small pile of brush, for the boys were too tired to make any elaborate arrangements
for the night.

The carriage cushions formed the pillow to this one bed which was to serve for all three, and
with the rug and one blanket under them, and the other blanket over them, George thought they
would get along very comfortably.

Bob was not long in finding plenty of water for the horses, and when he returned with it, after
it was decided to go supperless to bed, in order to save the provisions, all three lay down
on the hastily-improvised bed, little dreaming that they were within but a few rods of those
whom they were pursuing.

CHAPTER XVII.

NEAR NEIGHBORS.

As may be imagined, the sleep which visited the three boys was not as profound as it would
have been had they been in bed at Kenniston farm. In the first place, the bed of brush, which
had seemed so soft when they first lay down, seemed suddenly to have developed a great number
of hard places, while the ends of the boughs, which had seemed so small when they were cut,
apparently increased in size after they had served as a bed for an hour.

Many times during the night did Bob get up to see if the horses were all right, and, while
he would not admit that the bed had anything to do with his wakefulness, he knew, as well as
did his companions, that when sleeping at home, he hardly opened his eyes once during the entire
night.

It was at a very early hour, therefore, that the boys were up, and ready to continue the chase.
As a matter of course, after having gone to bed supperless, they were ready for a hearty breakfast,
and, since they would have plenty of time to eat it before sunrise, they at once made preparations
for breaking their fast.

Thanks to the cooked food they had with them, these preparations did not consume very much
time, since they were only obliged to take the paper packages from the carriage, and eat such
portions of Mrs. Kenniston's samples of cookery as they desired.

Bob gave his horses food and water before he satisfied his own hunger, and, just as he finished
this work, he cried, as he held his hand up, warningly:

"Hark! what was that?"

The boys listened intently several moments, but nothing could be heard save the rustling of
the leaves, as they were moved back and forth by the morning breeze, or the twitter of birds,
as they started out in search of breakfast, and George said, with a laugh:

"This is the first time I ever knew you to betray any caution, my dear boy, and you should
be commended for it; but just now I think it is thrown away, for I hardly believe there is
any one within half a mile of us who is awake so early."

"I thought I heard some one coming through the bushes," replied Bob, as he began a vigorous
attack on the food; "but I guess it was nothing but the wind."

Five minutes passed, during which each one was so busy with his breakfast that he had no time
for conversation, and then George motioned his companions to be silent. The warning was useless,
for all had heard a sound in the bushes, as if some heavy body was moving through the underbrush,
and all paused to listen.

There was evidently some person or animal near by, and moving directly away from them; but
it seemed so reasonable to suppose that it was a cow, or some other domestic animal, who had
slept out of doors all night, that it was some moments before any one of the three thought
of learning the cause of the noise.

Even though they had every reason to believe that those whom they were pursuing would spend
the night as they had spent it, each one of that party was so certain the thieves were a long
distance away, that the thought that it might be those they were in pursuit of which were making
the noise never occurred to them.

It was not until some time after the sounds had died away that George realized how important
it was that he should know what had caused them, and then he started up at once, dashing through
the underbrush toward the direction from which the noise had come.

Ralph and Bob started impulsively to follow him, and then the latter said, as he pulled his
companion back:

"One is enough to find the cow, for that is probably what we have been hearing, and we might
as well be eating our breakfast while he is hunting."

Ralph thought, as did Bob, that they had no occasion to disturb themselves simply at a rustling
of leaves in the woods, and he willingly followed his companion's suggestion.

But, before either of them could begin their breakfast again, a loud shout was heard from George,
which caused them to start to their feet in dismay, for they understood that something serious
had caused it.

"Harness the horses quickly!" George shouted again.

And without trying to understand the reason for this peremptory command, Bob and Ralph sprang
toward the animals.

It was not an order that could be obeyed very quickly, owing to the lack of facilities in their
stable.

The horses were quietly eating their breakfast; the harness was hanging on a tree some distance
away, and the carriage had been pulled into the woods so far that it would require at least
ten minutes before it could be gotten on to the road.

Bob began to harness one horse, while Ralph attended to the other, and while they were thus
employed, George came out of the woods in a very excited condition.

"We have been camping within five rods of the thieves!" he cried. "The noise we heard was probably
made by the horses as they led them out into the road, and I got there just in time to see
them drive away."

Haste surely made waste then, for all the party were so excited by what they had seen and heard,
and so anxious to start in pursuit quickly, that they retarded their own progress by the bungling
manner in which they went to work.

Ralph, in his eagerness, got the harness so mixed up that he was obliged to undo all he had
done and begin all over again before he could accomplish anything, while Bob searched five
minutes for the bridle, which, in the first excitement, he had flung some distance from him
among the bushes.

So far as coolness and presence of mind was concerned, George was no better off than his companions.
He attempted to pull the carriage into the road, and got it so fastened among the small trees
that Ralph was obliged to come to his assistance, lifting it bodily out before it could be
extricated.

In this confused way of doing things fully ten minutes of time was wasted, and the thieves
had a start of nearly twenty minutes before their pursuers were ready for the chase.

It was useless for them now to reproach themselves with carelessness in not examining the woods
when they first awoke, as they should have done, since they knew the thieves would spend the
night in some such place, and quite as useless to complain, because they did not attempt to
discover the cause of the noise when they first heard it. Had they done either one of these
things, which it seemed the most inexperienced in this kind of work would have done, they would
have discovered the team and had it then in their possession.

As it was, however, they could only try to atone for their carelessness by being more cautious
in the future, which each mentally resolved to be as he clambered into the carriage as soon
as the horses were harnessed. This time George sat on the front seat with Bob, where he could
more readily leap from the wagon if necessary.

Bob started his horses at full speed, and George was satisfied that there would be no necessity
of urging him to drive faster, for he held his steeds well in hand, requiring of them the best
possible gait.

"They have got quite a start of us," Bob said, after they had been on the road a few moments,
and while Ralph was regretting the absence of a comb, which would enable him to feel so much
more comfortable, "but I do not think your horses have had any grain since they stole them,
and if that is so, I don't think we shall have any trouble in overtaking them within an hour."

Perhaps, if Bob had spoken exactly as he thought, he would have insisted that his horses were
so much faster, that the twenty minutes' advantage which the thieves had could be more than
compensated for in speed; but just then he refrained from saying anything which might make
his troubled friend feel uncomfortable or disagreeable.

"Did you see the place where they slept last night?" Ralph asked of George, for as yet he had
not told them of what he had seen when he ran through the woods.

"Yes; I came right upon it when I first left you. They had made a sort of hut of boughs near
a clearing, in which I should judge the horses had been feeding. The instant I saw the camp,
and so near ours that a stone could have been thrown from one to the other, I thought it had
been made by the thieves, and I ran at full speed for the road, following a trail that looked
as if a carriage had but just passed that way. I got out of the woods just as they turned the
bend in the road, and simply had the satisfaction of seeing my team driven away at a gallop,
when, if I had done what almost any child would have thought of doing, it would have been in
my possession."

"Could you see the men?"

"No; the top of the carriage was up, and I could see no one. They were probably looking out
through the window and saw me, for if they stayed so near us since we stopped last night, they
must know who we are, and will try to escape, even if they kill the horses."

"I'm not so sure that they could have known who we were," said Bob, "for I have been trying
to think if we said anything about the team, or what we were there for, and I do not believe
we did."

If the men whom they were pursuing did not know that this party who had encamped so near them
were the ones in search of the team, it would be a great point in favor of our boys, for the
others would not be likely to push their horses so hard. Therefore, each one tried to recall
the conversation, and the result of this thought relieved George's mind somewhat, for no one
could remember that a thing had been said which might betray their errand.

The road over which they were traveling was a good one, and the horses were urged along by
Bob at a lively rate, save on ascending ground, when they were allowed to choose their own
pace, in order that they might not become "blown."

At no one place, owing to the trees on each side, could they see very far ahead on the road,
which prevented them from knowing whether they were gaining on the fugitives or not, although
Bob firmly believed they were, for his horses had never shown better speed, nor been more in
the humor for traveling.

"We shall be on our way home in less than two hours," he said, triumphantly, as the horses
dashed down a long hill at a pace that would be hard to beat; and then, as they began the ascent
of the next hill, all their hopes were dashed.

During the last ten minutes, it had seemed to Ralph that the easy-running carriage dragged,
and as the horses neared the top of the hill, he discovered the trouble.

"The hind axle is heated," he shouted, "and the wheel no longer turns."

It surely seemed as if everything was conspiring in favor of the thieves, for the pursuers
were now seriously crippled by a "hot box."

CHAPTER XVIII.

IN A TRAP.

It seemed so impossible to Bob that such a misfortune could overtake them just when success
appeared certain, that he could not believe what Ralph had said was true until he had jumped
out and examined the axle.

There was no doubt then but that they would be delayed for a long time, for the axle was already
so hot that it was smoking, and they had neither oil nor water with which to cool it.

In the valley or ravine through which they had just ridden there was no stream, and the only
thing which could be done was to look for one further ahead, since they had passed the last
house fully three miles behind.

"It's no use crying about it," said Bob, with an assumption of cheerfulness he was far from
feeling, "for here we are, and the sooner we mend matters the sooner we shall be riding on again."

"But what can we do?" asked Ralph, feeling thoroughly discouraged at this accident, which,
however quickly it might be repaired, would give the thieves a chance of making good their
escape. "Even if we had a whole ocean of water, you haven't got any oil after the axle is cool,
nor even a wrench with which to take the wheel off."

"One of us must walk on ahead until he comes to some house, where oil and a wrench can be borrowed.
Bob must drive his horses on at a walk, and halt at the first water he sees. It's an unlucky
accident for us, and it seems strange that it should have happened just when it did."

"It isn't so very strange," said Bob, as he started his team along at a walk, "and, as usual,
it's all my fault. When we moved the other day, we left our oil behind in the stable, and I
knew the wagon needed oiling when I got down to Kenniston's. I was just going to do it when
you drove up, and then, like an idiot, I forgot it."

It would do no good to discuss the causes of the accident after it had occurred. The only question
was as to how the damage could be repaired, and, after that was decided, to set about doing
it at once.

"I will go on ahead for the oil," said Ralph, starting out at a run as he spoke, and in few
moments he was lost to view, as he disappeared behind the trees, where the road made a decided
curve.

Bob and George walked, while the horses dragged the carriage with its one useless wheel, and
in this fashion the boys, who a few moments before had believed that in two hours they would
have overtaken the thieves and recovered the property, continued on their journey, as sad and
dispirited as before they had been happy and confident.

"If this hadn't happened," said Bob, bitterly, "we should have caught the men before noon;
but now it is an open question as to whether they won't get away."

"It will be strange if they don't escape," and George's voice sounded no more cheerful than
did Bob's; "for even if they were not sure who their neighbors were last night, they must have
been suspicious, and will do all they can to throw us off the scent. But there," he added,
with a shrug of the shoulder indicative of resolution; "what's the use of mourning over what
can't be helped? All we can say or do won't change matters, and we might as well look cheerful
as cry."

"I know that," replied Bob, with a grimace; "but when a fellow is disabled, in the woods, and
probably two or three miles from any house, the most appropriate thing is to cry, even if the
tears don't do any good."

At this moment, as if in answer to Bob's assertion that they were probably a long distance
from any house, and very much to their surprise, Ralph was seen coming down the road waving
his hands triumphantly.

"What is the matter?" cried George, not daring to believe that Ralph had already seen a house.

"There's a farm-house just around the bend here, with everything we need in the stable," shouted
Ralph, while he was yet some distance away. "I told the owner that we had a hot axle, and were
anxious to get on as quickly as possible, and he says we can borrow one of his wagons, or take
anything we need to fix ours."

It is needless to say how delighted George and Bob were by the information Ralph had brought.
Instead of losing nearly the whole of that day, as they had feared they should, by walking
several miles before finding a stable, they could repair damages in a comparatively short time,
and could, perhaps, yet overtake the men before night.

"Hurrah!" shouted Bob, as he urged his horses into a trot, the party running behind.

And in a few moments they were in the stable-yard of a large farm, where the proprietor was
awaiting their arrival, ready to lend them any assistance in his power.

Both he, as well as they, knew exactly what to do for this outgrowth of carelessness, and pail
after pail of water was dashed on to the hub of the wheel to cool it off, even while he was
yet repeating his offer to loan them one of his wagons if they were in a hurry to be on their
journey again.

Leaving Bob and Ralph to continue the cold-water application, since not more than two could
work at a time advantageously, George went with the farmer to see what sort of a vehicle they
could borrow in exchange for their own.

He returned very shortly, however, with the word that he thought it best for them to get their
own carriage into working order, since those belonging to the farmer were all so heavy that
they would probably gain in speed, if they waited for their own, more than they would lose in time.

This decision was about what Bob had expected, and he continued his work, which had not been
delayed during George's absence, until it was thought that they could remove the wheel.

It was a hard, and quite a long job; but it was accomplished finally, and then, when the iron
was nearly cold, a plentiful amount of oil was applied; the other wheels were lubricated, and
the boys were ready to continue their journey again, having lost by this accident not more
than an hour's time.

"You are all right now," said the farmer, after he had positively refused to take any payment
for his own time or for the use of his tools, "an' I reckon the waiting here won't make much
of any difference to you."

"It wouldn't have been of any account if we hadn't been chasing a pair of horses of mine that
were stolen at Sawyer. We were close behind them, and should have overtaken them by this time
if it hadn't been for this delay."

"What is the color of your horses?" asked the man, evincing such a sudden interest that it
seemed certain he knew something about the missing property.

"A pair of small, dark chestnut horses, in a box buggy, driven by two young men," replied Bob,
quickly, confident that they were about to hear some good news, and answering all possible
questions at once, in order that they might not be delayed any longer than necessary.

"Then it is fortunate for you that you had trouble which made you stop here, or else you would
have gone on and missed them," replied the man, speaking slowly, as if there was no possible
reason why the boys should hurry on in pursuit.

"When did you see them?" asked George, hurriedly. "Tell us at once, so that we needn't lose
any more time."

"There's no need for you to rush," drawled the man, much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys
in suspense, "for if you stay right where you are, you will see them. They've got to come back
this way, sure."

The boys looked around as if they expected to see the thieves pop out from some hiding-place
near by, and after waiting a moment to enjoy the effect his words had produced, the farmer
asked, as he pointed nearly opposite the house to where a road branched off from the highway,
leading, apparently, into the woods:

"Do you see that road?" And then, as if realizing how useless such a question was when the
road was so well defined, he continued: "Wa-al, I reckon that the same team you are huntin'
after was driv up that road about an hour or so ago. It was a small pair of dark chestnut hosses,
an' good ones, with a fancy buggy, an' two young fellers drivin'."

"Where does that road lead to?" asked Bob, excitedly.

"That's the joke of it," said the farmer, with a laugh. "It don't lead nowhere 'cept inter
my wood-lot, an' that's what made me notice ther team so perticularly, 'cause I couldn't make
out what they wanted up there. I tell you what it is, boys, you've got your hoss-thieves in
a trap, an' you kin pull 'em out whenever you want to."

"Are you sure that there isn't any way out of that? Can't they strike the main road by driving
across some field?" asked George.

"Wa-al, I've driv over that road as many as forty times every year for the last thirty, haulin'
down wood, an' I wouldn't undertake to git a wheel-barrer out any other way than I went in.
You kin stay here an' ketch 'em when they come out, or go in after 'em--they'll be there!"

CHAPTER XIX.

CLOSE QUARTERS.

It hardly seemed possible to the boys that, after the mishap which it seemed would give the
thieves all the time they needed to make good their escape, they could be so near to them that
their capture seemed certain.

But the farmer insisted that there was no outlet to the road; that a team answering to the
description of the one George had lost had been driven in there, and that it had not come out.
Therefore, there could be no question but that they had the thieves in a trap, as the farmer
had said, and all that was necessary was to go and get them or the team.

At first they were about to start out without any plan whatever, intent only on getting the
horses as quickly as possible; but George realized in time that, secure as the thieves appeared
to be against escape, all might be changed by too much precipitation.

If they should rush in recklessly, the men might get past them by concealing the team in the
bushes until they had passed that particular point, and then the road would be clear before
them, unless the farmer could succeed in stopping them.

It was necessary, therefore, that, in going up this road, which they were told was about two
miles long, they should not only see where the thieves had gone in, but where it would be possible
for them to come out, in case they should succeed in making a detour through the woods.

The farmer, after listening to the discussion which the boys were having, suggested that they
block up the road near its entrance with his heavy carts, and then, if the thieves should get
past them, they would be obliged to leave the team at the obstruction in order to make good
their own escape.

This suggestion was so good that they followed it at once. Bob using his horses to haul a hay-rack,
a heavy ox-cart and two dump-carts into the road, about two hundred yards from the highway,
overturning and wedging them in in such a way that a passage through could not be made in less
than half an hour.

The farmer, having work that forenoon, which kept him near the house, promised to keep a sharp
lookout while the boys went after the team, and to give the alarm in case the men should come
down towards the barricade.

Then, all the preparations having been completed, there was nothing to prevent them from going
into the trap the thieves had voluntarily entered.

Bob thought they ought to have weapons in case the men should attempt to fight for the possession
of their ill-gotten booty; but George refused to consider the idea even for a moment. He had
no thought that the men would do anything of the kind, and, even though he was going after
his own property, he was not willing to go in such a way as might endanger the life of any one.

"If you want any weapons, take a good stout club," he said, "and I think you will find even
that unnecessary, for as soon as the men see us, they will do their best to get away."

Bob was by no means satisfied to start up the road unarmed; but since it was George's property
they were in search of, he thought his orders should be obeyed, even though the attempt should
be unsuccessful because of it.

"If I was in your place, I should make sure of the men as well as the team," the farmer called
out, as they started, "for there's a good many more horse-thieves in the country than are needed,
an' it's doin' a good turn to honest people to put 'em where they can't run off other people's
property."

George made no reply, but at the same time he did not propose to make an amateur detective
of himself, unless the men should attempt to prevent him from taking his own, and then he would
have no hesitation about causing their arrest.

There was no difficulty in following the track of the carriage, for there had been so little
travel on the road that the impress of the wheels was distinctly seen, and there could be no
question but that it would be an easy matter to see where it was taken into the woods in case
the men should attempt to hide.

"I guess we had our labor for nothing in blocking up the road," said Bob, as they walked along,
"for there is no chance of our passing the team so long as we can see the tracks as plain as this."

"We certainly didn't hurt ourselves piling up the carts, and the time was well spent, if only
for the sake of the precaution," said George; and then, stopping suddenly, after they had walked
nearly a mile, he pointed to a second track, which led directly into the woods a few yards
ahead of them. "They have been to the end of the road, and come back," he whispered. "Perhaps
they have just turned in here after hearing us."

For a moment the three boys stood looking at the trail made by those they had been so anxious
to meet, and then George said, in a low tone:

"We mustn't lose any time here, and when we do start it must be quickly. We will follow this
track in, and keep right on in it; for we shall either find the team now in the bushes, or
else the men will have done as I feared--passed us while we were on the road."

There was still a chance that the men might get away with the team if they had succeeded in
reaching the road in the rear of the boys, for it might be possible for them to clear away
the obstructions near the main road before the boys could run a mile, unless the farmer could
prevent them.

George dashed into the bushes, followed closely by Ralph and Bob, and before they had gone
very far, it was evident to all that the men were trying to do just as George had suggested.

The track made by the carriage could be followed very readily, and there was no longer any
question, after the boys had run a hundred yards, but that they were traveling in a half circle,
the end of which would be at the road.

"Come on as fast as you can," shouted George, when he thus saw his suspicions verified; and,
regardless of whether he was followed or not, he dashed ahead at full speed, perfectly satisfied
that when he saw his team again it would be at the barricade.

When he reached the road up which they had just come, the second track of wheels could be seen,
and he half expected to hear the farmer's warning cry, forgetting for the time that any ordinary
pair of lungs could hardly be heard a mile away.

Close behind George came Ralph and Bob, both excited by the thought that there was yet a possibility
the men might escape with the team, and both running as fast as they could.

"They've come this way!" shouted George, "and now it only remains to be seen whether we can
get there in time."

There was no need to say anything to urge either of the boys on to greater speed, for they
were making every effort, and George himself was really the one who would be left behind if
the race was continued very long.

Bent only on reaching a given point as quickly as possible, the boys paid no attention to anything
else save getting over the ground rapidly, and the farmer's voice rang out long and loud before
they realized that they heard it.

"Hello! Hello-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!" was the cry.

And when finally the boys did hear it, they understood by the tone that there was urgent reason
for them to make haste, for now, beyond a doubt, the thieves were trying hard to remove the
barricade.

Panting, almost breathless, but not realizing how nearly exhausted they were, the boys rushed
on, intent only on noting the way, that they might lose no time or vantage by a misstep, until
they emerged from the woods at a point where they could see that which was causing such an
outcry from the farmer, who was taking quite as much interest in the saving of their property
as he would have done in his own.

George could see his team halted in front of the barricade they had piled up with so much,
and what at the time Bob had thought useless, labor, while the men were straining every nerve
to remove it, the farmer standing at a safe distance, screaming at the top of his voice, even
though he must have seen the boys coming towards him as rapidly as they could run.

Already had the two men succeeded in removing the two dump-carts, and were now at work upon
the hay-rack, with every prospect of pulling it sufficiently out of the way to admit of their
driving past; but when they saw the three boys coming down the road, they evidently concluded
that they had worked quite as long as was safe, for they began to look out for their own welfare,
instead of trying longer to get away with the team.

After one look at the boys, probably to make sure they were the same ones whom they had seen
coming up the road, the thieves ceased their efforts to move the hay-rack, and sought safety
in flight, running down the road towards Babcock, instead of trying to escape in the opposite
direction.

The farmer, who was anxious that all horse-thieves should be placed beyond the possibility
of carrying on their business, at once started in pursuit, probably without thought as to how
he could make prisoners of two men whom he had not dared to grapple with when they were trying
to tear down the barrier which prevented them from getting away with their booty.

George, who still continued to lead the party, stopped when he reached the side of the carriage.
He had gained possession of his team once more, and he was content.

CHAPTER XX.

A SOUVENIR OF THE THIEVES.

Even had they been so disposed, neither Bob nor Ralph could have joined the farmer in the pursuit
of the men, because by the time they arrived at the carriage they were so nearly exhausted
that it would have been a matter of impossibility for them to run fifty yards further, whatever
the inducement.

All three stood by the side of the recovered property, panting and breathless, but watching
eagerly the unequal race, where the two men could run a trifle more than twice as fast as their
pursuer.

The farmer, seeing how sadly he was being distanced, looked behind for an instant, to see if
any of the boys were going to aid him, and then, seeing that they had all halted, gave up the
contest by hobbling back to his stable, looking quite as red in the face and panting quite
as hard as if he had run a thousand yards instead of twenty.

"If you'd only followed me we could have caught 'em all," he said, in a half-reproachful tone,
as he came up to the boys.

"I don't believe you could have overtaken them if all of us had been close at your heels,"
replied George, speaking with considerable difficulty because of the shortness of his breath. Might accept

The boys, glad of a rest, waited for his return, until, after he had been absent nearly an
hour, when he could easily walk the distance in twenty minutes, Bob and Ralph started in search
of him, leaving Jim and Dick there in case he should return.

Mr. Simpson both astonished and alarmed them by saying that George had not been to the house
since he first left it, and then they began a hurried search, which resulted in nothing. They
called him by name, started Jim and Dick out even to the remote portions of the lot; but without
success.

Strange as it seemed, it was nevertheless true that George had mysteriously disappeared.

CHAPTER XXII.

A CRUEL DEED.

When the boys met in the wood-lot at the spot where George had left them, after they had made
the first hurried survey of the place, consternation was imprinted on every face. They knew
that Harnett would not voluntarily have gone away without telling them, and an undefined but
a very great fear took possession of them.

Each looked at the other as if fearing to speak that which was in his mind, and yet all were
conscious that whatever was done to find their missing friend should be done at once.

It seemed so improbable that anything could have happened to him there without their knowing
it, that no one ventured to put his suspicions into words, and each waited for the other to speak.

"It can do no good for us to stand here," said Ralph, after he had waited some time for a suggestion
from Bob. "George is either not here, or else some accident has happened which prevents him
from answering. If he had been here, and as he was when he left us, he must have heard us when
we called. Now, what shall we do?"

All three of the moonlighters stood looking at him in silent dismay. They were bewildered by
the sudden disappearance, and Ralph understood that whatever steps were taken toward finding
George must be directed by him, for his companions seemed incapable even of connected thought.

"In the first place," he said, "let's make a thorough search of the wood-lot, beginning from
this point and working toward the house in the direction he disappeared. If we don't find him
here, we will try to make up our minds what to do."

There was no dissenting voice raised against this proposition, and Ralph began the search by
directing the boys to stand in a row, about ten feet apart, and then walk straight down to
the fence, carefully examining every place in which George could have hidden.

In this way a lane, at least forty feet wide, was examined thoroughly, and as nothing was found
by the time they reached the fence, the line was formed again ten feet further on, the march
continuing until they reached a point abreast of the one they had started from.

No one spoke during this search, for it seemed as though they were hunting for the lifeless
body of their friend, and when again they arrived at the fence, they ranged along in a new
line, silently, afraid almost to look at the ground because of that which they might see.

And at least a portion of their fears were to be realized, for as they walked along on this
third sad journey, they first found a place where the bushes and ferns had been trampled down
as if some desperate struggle had taken place, and then, a few feet further on, almost hidden
in a pile of brushwood, they saw that for which they sought.

It was the body of George, looking as if all life had departed, the face beaten by cruel blows
until it was nearly unrecognizable, the clothing torn, and lying still as death.

Even then no one spoke; no cry of alarm or of astonishment was given, for this was what they
had been expecting to find during all the search.

Neither of the moonlighters had recovered from their first bewilderment, and, as if this show
of helplessness on the part of his companions nerved him up, Ralph still preserved his presence
of mind.

Kneeling down by the apparently lifeless body, Ralph unfastened or tore apart the clothing,
until he could lay his hand over his friend's heart. After an instant's silence, during which
it seemed to each boy that he could hear the pulsations of his own heart, Ralph said in a hard,
unnatural voice, which no one would have recognized as his:

"He is not dead, for I can feel his heart beat feebly. One of you go for a physician, while
the others help me carry him to the house."

"You take my horses, and drive first to Sawyer and then to Bradford for three or four of the
best doctors you can find, and drive faster than you ever drove before," said Bob to Jim.

The latter, finding actual relief in having something definite to do, started off at full speed
towards the farm-house, while Ralph began to make a rude kind of a litter.

Two fence-rails with limbs of trees laid across them, the whole covered by the coats and vests
of the boys, was the best that could be improvised in a short time, and on this George was
laid as tenderly as possible.

It seemed to all the boys as if he must be reviving somewhat, for they fancied they could see
him breathe as they moved him, and Bob was certain he had lifted one of his hands as if to
touch his head.

It was a mournful procession they formed as they moved slowly towards the farm-house, Ralph
and Bob carrying the litter, while Dick stood ready to help them whenever he might be needed.

At the fence they were met by both Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, who had, of course, learned the sad
news from Jim, and had hurried out with almost as much sorrow in their hearts as if he had
been a son of theirs, for they had learned to love George even before he had been the means
of saving their homestead to them.

Thanks to the help which the old people were able to give, the wounded boy was carried much
more quickly and easily along, and in a short time, which seemed very long to the anxious ones,
he was lying on a bed in the farm-house.

Every effort was made to revive him as soon as he was placed in a comfortable position on the
bed in the room, sweet-scented with herbs, and with such success that in a short time there
was a movement of the eyelids, followed by a low moan which, though piteous, was welcomed by
the boys gladly, for it told of life.

From the time they had found him stricken down by some murderous hand, Ralph had noticed that
George still held tightly clutched in his left hand a piece of paper.

He had hoped from the first that it might afford some clue to the murderous assailants, and
had tried to remove it, but without success.

Now, however, when it seemed as if consciousness was returning, the hands unclasped from what
had probably been a clutch at those who had attacked him, and the paper fell to the floor.

The first physician whom Jim had found entered at this moment, and, picking the paper up, Ralph
held it until he should hear the medical man's decision.

He was disappointed in getting this very speedily, however, for the physician began a long
and careful examination of the injured boy, in which he was assisted by the second doctor,
who arrived ten minutes later.

George was in good hands now, and since they could do nothing to aid him, Ralph beckoned to
Bob to leave the room, for he was anxious to learn what was contained in the paper, and wished
that some one should share the secret with him.

"This is what George had in his hand when we found him," he said, when they were out of the
house, "and I think it will, perhaps, explain who it was who tried to murder him."

Bob stood breathlessly waiting for Ralph to open the paper which was crumpled tightly up in
that almost death clutch, and as he saw it, he uttered a cry of surprise and anger.

It was a fragment of the description of the wood-lot which had been found in the carriage when
the thieves left it.

"Those men have done this," cried Bob, as he clenched his hands in impotent rage--"the ones
whom George would not help catch after they had stolen his team. They knew he had this paper,
and when they saw him, they either tried simply to get possession of it, George resisting,
or at the first attempted to kill him."

"They can't be very far from here," said Ralph, as if wondering what other crime they would
attempt to commit before they left.

"No, and they shan't get very far, either. I'll send Dick over to Sawyer for the officers,
and if it is possible, we'll have those fellows where they can't do any more mischief."

Dick was only too willing to go when he heard what Bob had to tell him, and in the team he
had driven over in he started at nearly as rapid a pace as Jim had.

Very shortly after he had gone, Jim returned. The first physician was from Bradford, and he
had met him on the road, while the second he had found in Sawyer, having gone there to visit
a patient. Both were said to be very skillful, and Jim had sensibly concluded that there was
no necessity of getting any more.

To him the boys told of the discovery they had made regarding the scrap of paper, and had they
followed his advice, they would have started in search of the villains then and there, without
waiting the tardy movements of the officers.

But both Ralph and Bob thought their place just then was with their friend, rather than searching
for those who had assaulted him, and they persuaded Dick to forego his idea of making a personal
search for the men.

It was not long that the boys were in suspense as to the report of the physicians, for hardly
had they finished discussing the discovery they had made as to who had done the cruel deed,
when one of the medical gentlemen came from George's room.

Unless, he said, there were internal injuries, of which they were then unable to learn, George's
condition was not one of imminent danger. That he had been severely injured there could be
no doubt; but there was every reason to believe that he would recover, unless some more serious
wound than those already found had been given.

He had not recovered consciousness yet, and there was hardly any chance that he would for some
time, while the physician barely intimated that it was possible, owing to the wounds on his
head, that he might never fully recover his mental powers.

It was just such a report as medical men often make--one which leaves the anxious ones in quite
as much suspense as before, and neither Ralph nor Bob was just certain whether it was favorable
to their friend or not.

CHAPTER XXIII.

THE TOWN ORDINANCE.

The news which Dick carried to Sawyer was sufficient to create a great excitement in that naturally
quiet little town. In addition to what looked like an attempted murder, was the fact that George
Harnett, whom they had all respected before the conflagration, and admired after it, was the
intended victim.

There was no need for Dick to urge that officers be sent to try to effect the capture of the
scoundrels, for almost before he had finished telling the story, a large party of citizens
started in search of the men, determined that they should answer for their crime.

Therefore, when Dick returned, it was with so large a following that the physicians rushed
out in the greatest haste to insist on their keeping at a respectful distance from the house,
lest the noise might affect their patient.

Bob and his partners were anxious to join in the search, and urged Ralph to accompany them,
since he could do no good to George by remaining; but he refused to leave his friend, even
though he could not aid him, and the party started without him, a look of determination on
their faces that boded no good to the professed oil prospectors in case they should be caught.

During all of that night Ralph remained with George, listening to his delirious ravings, as
he supposed he was still battling for his life with the men, and just at daybreak Bob returned
alone. The search had been even more successful than any of the party had dared to hope for
when they set out, for the men had been captured in the woods about four miles from the place
where the assault had been made and in the pocket of one of them was the paper from which one
corner had been left in George's hand.

They had evidently believed that they would be securely hidden in the woods, for they had built
a camp, and were in it asleep when they were found.

Bob had been one of the first to rush in upon them, and, seeing him, the men had shown fight;
but the sight of the crowd behind him prevented any serious demonstrations, and after that
their only fear had been that some one would attempt to do them an injury, a fear for which,
at one time, it seemed as if there were very good grounds.

When the prisoners had been carried back to Sawyer, Bob had left the party, in order to report
their success to Ralph, as well as to learn George's condition.

Until Harnett's friends could be informed of his situation, Ralph and Bob were looked upon
as the only ones having a right to dictate as to what should be done for him, and Ralph was
anxious to have the course they should pursue decided. With this in view, he had a long discussion
with Bob as to what should be done, and the result of it was that he started at once for Bradford,
to telegraph to George's mother, and to hire a nurse to take care of him.

Mrs. Harnett, George's mother, lived in Maine, and it would necessarily be quite a long time
before she could reach her son, even if she got the telegram as soon as it was sent. Therefore,
it was important that a nurse should be procured, at least until she could arrive, and decide
what should be done with the patient.

After this was done, Ralph started to return, not wanting to be away any longer from his friend
than possible, and as he neared Sawyer, he met the officer who had arrested George and Bob
for violation of the town ordinance.

"Where is Mr. Hubbard?" asked the officer, after Ralph had given him all the particulars of
George's condition.

"He is now at Mr. Simpson's, waiting there until I shall get back."

"Is he particularly needed there?"

"Oh, no. As for the matter of that, neither one of us will be actually needed after this forenoon,
for I have just been to Bradford to engage a nurse for George until his mother shall get here.
Why did you ask?"

"Well, you see before this assault was committed, it was decided to call the case one of carrying
glycerine through the town, to-day. Now it has been decided, in view of the service Harnett
rendered at the conflagration, to drop the case against him, and only proceed against Hubbard.
But if his presence was necessary to Harnett, we could postpone it easily enough."

"But George would feel very badly if the case against him was dropped," said Ralph, earnestly.
"Before the arrest was made, his only hope was that it would be made, so that he might prove
he had nothing to do with it. Isn't it possible to proceed against him, even if he isn't there?"

"And what if it is?" asked the officer, with a smile.

"If it is I would urge you to call the case against George at the same time as that against
Bob, for I know, beyond a doubt, that he will be proven not guilty."

"I'll see what can be done; and if you and Hubbard can leave, come over about two o'clock this
afternoon."

"We will be there," replied Ralph.

And then he drove on, rejoiced at the thought that even while his friend was sick, he could
remove one cause of trouble from him.

When Bob was told of the interview Ralph had had, he was by no means so well pleased that the
case was to be opened so soon.

"Why didn't you tell the officer that I couldn't be spared from George's side for a moment?"
he asked. "That would have settled it, for just now every one is sympathizing with him."

"In the first place, it wouldn't have been true," replied Ralph, "and then again, if it has
got to come, the sooner it's over the better, I should think."

Bob made a wry face over the matter, for he had hoped that in the excitement caused by the
attack on George, both the cases would be dropped, and since there could be no doubt about
his conviction, that would have been the most pleasant way out of it, so far as he was concerned.

Ralph used all the arguments he could think of to persuade Bob to look at the matter in a philosophical
light, and it was not until he urged the satisfaction it would give George, when he recovered,
to know that he was cleared of the charge, that Bob would even admit that he was willing to
go, although he knew he must do so.

As soon as the professional nurse arrived and began her duties, Bob and Ralph harnessed the
former's team, and started first for the moonlighters' hut, where Jim had said he would be
that day, for the purpose of getting him to testify in George's behalf.

This young moonlighter was quite as averse to appearing at court as his partner had been, for
he feared the charge might be altered to include him, but Ralph persuaded him that such would
hardly be probable, at the same time that he urged him to accompany them, for George's sake.

On arriving at Sawyer it was found that the authorities were willing to call George's case
in consideration of the fact that his innocence could be easily proven, and the trial began.

Of course, with Bob, Jim and Ralph to testify in George's behalf, there was no doubt as to
his innocence in the matter, and quite as naturally, the testimony which cleared one convicted
the other, for Bob had told the story exactly as the matter had happened.

George was found "not guilty," and public opinion being in favor just then of any of the friends
of the injured man, Bob was let off with a reprimand and a fine of ten dollars.

Bob was in high glee over this easy settlement of the matter, as was Ralph, and when the constable
handed them the forty dollars which he had taken as security for their appearance, the young
moonlighter insisted on presenting him with five dollars of his twenty, as a "token of his
appreciation."

During the ride back to the Simpson farm, and Jim accompanied them in order to remain there
over-night in case he should be needed, Bob unfolded a scheme which he declared he had been
maturing for some time, although Ralph insisted that it had only occurred to him after his
fortunate escape from the clutches of the law.

"We shall have no business for two or three weeks at least," he said; "and while George is
so sick there is really nothing we can do for him. Now I propose that you and I find the signs
of oil that those fellows claim to have found, and when George gets well the work will be all
done for him."

"But can we do it?" asked Ralph, thinking that he would be of but little service, since his
knowledge of the oil business was confined to what he had seen of the moonlighters' operations.

"Of course we can. I have done a good deal of prospecting, and, except that I couldn't find
the place they describe by measurements, I can do the work better than George, for he has had
no experience whatever."

"I am willing to do it if I can," said Ralph, "for surely we can be doing no harm in trying
to prove whether the property is valuable or not."

"No harm! Of course there wouldn't be any!" cried Bob, growing enthusiastic over his scheme.
"And if we do find things as plain as I believe we shall, there will be no trouble in borrowing
money enough to sink the well at once, so that when George gets out we could surprise him with
a little oil property that would make his eyes stick out."

Ralph felt almost as if he was losing his breath at the "size" Bob's scheme was assuming, and
he said, faintly:

"Oh, we wouldn't do that!"

"Indeed, but we would, and I reckon Harnett wouldn't feel very badly about it either."

"If you were sure of striking oil, I'm not sure but that father would advance the necessary
money to do it," he said, falling in at once with Bob's scheme, he was so dazzled by it.

"That would be all the better," cried Bob, excitedly; "and I tell you what it is, Gurney, if
I don't show you a five-hundred-barrel well in that same wood-lot, you shall have my head for
a football."

Ralph was hardly in need of such a plaything, but Bob's scheme had so excited him that when
he did finally succeed in getting to sleep that night, it was only to dream of wonderful wells
spouting wonderfully pure oil.

CHAPTER XXIV.

BOB'S INDUSTRY.

Bob Hubbard was not one to give up anything he had once decided upon without a trial, and when
he told Ralph that between them they would find the oil and sink the well before George recovered,
he intended to do it if it was within the range of possibilities.

Very many operators in the oil region looked upon Bob as one of the best prospectors there,
and while they fully understood his reckless manner, and agreed that it could not be said that
he was strictly truthful, they had the most perfect confidence in his reports on land.

Therefore, it was no vain boast when Bob said that if there were good signs of oil on the Simpson
wood-lot, he could easily borrow money enough to sink a well, for almost any one of the capitalists
of Bradford would have been willing to make the loan upon his representations.

This wood-lot of Simpson's had attracted Bob's attention some time before, as the reader already
knows, and, despite the assertions of some oil prospectors to the contrary, he had always maintained
that a good paying well would be found there.

It had been his intention to buy the land; but he had neglected to do so, as he was in the
habit of neglecting his own business until it was too late. But he would be satisfied to prove
that he had been correct in his views by striking oil there, even if he was opening the property
for some one else, and just then he saw the opportunity of doing a favor for his friend at
the same time that he proved the truth of his own statements.

On the morning after he had spoken of his "scheme" to Ralph, he was up some time before the
sun was, even though he had watched by George's side until midnight, and was only waiting for
the professional nurse to relieve Ralph from his duty of watcher, before beginning the work
he had proposed to do.

During the night it had seemed as if George had recovered consciousness for a few moments,
although he had not spoken, and the physician, who had remained at the farm-house, was called
to the patient's side.

This brief revival of consciousness, to be followed immediately by a fever, was what the medical
man had predicted, and he then said that George would appear to be very much worse in the morning;
but that it was the turning of the fever which would show whether he was ever to regain the
full possession of all his faculties.

Therefore, when the morning came, and George, in a high fever, seemed to be very near death
his friends were much less alarmed for his safety than they would have been, had the change
not been expected.

It was unfortunate that he could not have been removed to the Kenniston farm, where he would
have been nearer medical aid in case he should need it suddenly; but he could not have been
taken where he would have received more tender or devoted care then he did from Mr. Simpson
and his wife.

The only possible aid which either Ralph or Bob could have given, after they had relieved the
nurse of the care of watching during the night, would have been in case they were needed to
go to town for anything which the patient might require. Except for that, they might as well
be out prospecting as remaining at the farm-house.

Therefore, in order that they might both be away, and feel perfectly at ease, Bob had arranged
with Dick to come over and remain during the day with Jim, to act as messenger in case there
was any necessity for it.

Bob's horses were there, and after breakfast, when Jim had arrived, and the nurse had resumed
her duties, there was really nothing to prevent them from going where they pleased.

Much as he wanted to go with Bob, Ralph was uncertain as to whether he should leave his friend
until after he had spoken with the physician regarding it, and then, learning that he could
be of no possible assistance by remaining, he announced that he was ready to begin the work
of prospecting again, which had been brought to such a sad end the day previous.

Bob started out excited by the thought of what they would accomplish, and so intent upon his
scheme that he rattled on with explanations of how this or that might be accomplished, until
Ralph began to look upon sinking an oil well as mere child's play, and quite convinced that
it could easily be done, even without capital.

Both the boys were satisfied that there were no signs of oil in such localities as they had
examined the day previous, therefore there was no occasion for them to do that work over again,
and Bob began his labors by starting through the wood-lot in an entirely different direction,
which brought them to a small stream, or marsh, which ran directly across the land.

The water-course, if such it could be called, was nearly dried up, but Bob showed every signs
of delight at finding it so easily, and said to Ralph, as he began to wade along its course,
regardless alike of wet feet or mud-plashed clothing:

"Here is where we shall find the first signs, if there is any oil around here. Follow me, and
sing out when you see any greasy-looking water in these little pools."

It is quite probable that Ralph would have waded in streams which were almost entirely covered
with oil, and yet never have "sung out" once, for he was at a loss to know how oil-covered
water should look; but before they had traveled twenty yards, Bob said, excitedly:

"Why don't you say something? I thought you would like to be the first one to discover signs
on your own land, so I have held my tongue for the last five minutes, expecting to hear you shout."

"But what shall I say?" asked Ralph, in surprise. "I haven't seen any oil yet."

"Well, you're a fine prospector, you are!" and Bob looked at his companion as if in the most
perfect amazement that he did not understand fully the business which he had had no experience
in. "What do you call that?" and Bob pointed to the water-pools that were covered with something
which showed different colors, not unlike a soap-bubble.

"I've seen that queer-looking water for some time," replied Ralph, innocently; "but that isn't
oil."

"You may think so," said Bob, with a laugh, "but you let some of these oil operators from Bradford
see that, and then it would do your heart good to hear them offer you big prices for the land.
That's oil, my boy, and it shows up as plain as the nose on your face. We'll follow this swale
up until we find where the oil ceases, and then I'll show you a place where you can sink a
well without a possibility of losing any money by the operation."

Ralph was now quite as eager and excited as his companion was, and the two splashed on through
the mud and water, feeling much as gold-seekers do when they believe they are following up
the leads to that precious metal.

Up the marshy land they walked until they were very nearly in the center of the lot, and then
Bob stopped, with a gesture of satisfaction.

At this point the difference in the water was very marked, the line of oil, as it oozed out
from a little bank, showing clearly, while above the water was pure.

"There's one thing certain," said Bob, triumphantly, as he stood upon the sponge-like bank
which afforded him so much satisfaction to see. "Those who have laughed at me because I insisted
that the oil belt extended in this direction would feel kind of foolish if they could see this,
wouldn't they?"

"But is it what you might call a good showing?" asked Ralph, still incredulous that this land,
which they had purchased only through charity for Mr. Simpson, should prove so valuable.

It seemed to him that Bob must be mistaken, or those living in the vicinity would have discovered
it some time before.

"Well, I should say it was a good showing," cried Bob, excitedly. "Why, Gurney, there isn't
one well out of twenty that are sunk which looms up like this. It will yield a thousand barrels
if it yields a pint."

The only question, then, as to whether it was really valuable property, it would seem, was
whether it would yield the pint; and, if one could judge from Bob's face, there was no doubt
about that.

He was radiantly triumphant--not that he had discovered the oil, for others had done that before
him, but that his views on the location of the oil belt had proved correct, and he was determined
that by his efforts the supply should be made to yield, even though he could have no pecuniary
interest in the matter.

"We'll sink the well here, and I'll begin the work this very afternoon," he said. "But first
we must go back to the house, and we'll mark our way, so that there'll be no difficulty about
finding the spot again."

Then Bob started toward the farm-house, walking rapidly, as if his feet could hardly be made
to keep pace with his thoughts, and breaking off the tops of the bushes to mark the way.

"But how are you going to work without money?" asked Ralph, almost doubting if his companion
was quite right in his mind.

"Do you think that a sight of that place isn't as good as a big bank account? Why, we only
need about three thousand dollars to do it all."

"Three--thousand--dollars!" echoed Ralph.

"That's all. You write to your father, tell him what we have found, and ask him to send the
money right on," said Bob, in a matter-of-fact tone.

"And do you suppose he would send such an amount of money simply for the asking?"

And Ralph's doubts in regard to the moonlighter's sanity increased each moment.

"It don't make much difference whether he does or not," was the careless reply. "I can get
everything we need to go to work with on the strength of that showing, and I tell you that
we'll have that well flowing just as soon as possible. But you write to your father, ask him
to come on and see what we have got, and, after he has talked with those who are in the business
here, he won't hesitate about the money."

"Yes, I can do that," said Ralph, slowly, but doubting very much whether he could accomplish
anything by it. "But it will take three or four days at least before we can hear from him."

"That don't make any difference, for it won't delay us. I'm going to start right out to buy
the engine, and by the time we hear from him, we shall be at work."

By this time they were at the stable, and Bob began harnessing his horses, in proof of what
he said.

"I wouldn't do that," expostulated Ralph. "It may not be as good as you think it is, and you
may get into an awful lot of trouble about it."

"Look here, Gurney," said Bob, impressively. "There's oil there--plenty of it--and I know what
I'm about. You just let me alone, and by the time Harnett is able to understand anything, I'll
be ready to prove to him that both he and you are rich, all through your charitable idea of
buying Simpson's wood-lot."

CHAPTER XXV.

THE WORK BEGUN.

After deciding in his own mind that he would sink a well in the place he had found, taking
the work and debts upon himself when it was all to be for the pecuniary advantage of his friend,
Bob was not one to lose any time.

As soon as he got back to the house and could harness his horses, he had started for Bradford
to make arrangements for the purchase, on credit, of such machinery as was needed, and all
this had been done so quickly that Jim and Dick were not aware he had returned from prospecting
until they saw him driving away.

As a matter of course they questioned Ralph as to why their partner had left so hurriedly,
and his reply excited them wonderfully.

He told them of what Bob had found, and then he realized how good the evidences of oil were,
for the boys were in a perfect fever of delight as he explained what they had seen. Then he
told them of what he thought was a mad scheme on Bob's part, his intention to begin sinking
a well even before he had any money to carry on the work, and instead of being surprised at
their partner's rashness, as he had expected they would be, they seemed to think it a very
natural course for him to pursue.

They had quite as "wild" an attack as Bob had had, and although Ralph was surprised at it then,
he soon grew accustomed to such phases of the "oil fever," after he had seen more of the business.

Jim and Dick insisted on going out to see what their partner had discovered, not satisfied
with Ralph's description, and while they were gone he tried to convince himself that this possibility
of his becoming rich, even before he had been obliged to struggle with the world, was true,
and not a dream.

He was sitting on the wood-pile, arguing to himself as to whether Bob might not be mistaken,
when Mr. Simpson came out of the house with the report that George was sleeping, and he decided
to tell him the news, to see if he would be as confident as the others.

But before he could speak, Jim and Dick came up, panting, but triumphant.

"That's the biggest thing I ever saw!" said Jim, as he wiped the perspiration from his face,
and then turning to Mr. Simpson, he added, "That wood-lot is worth about a thousand times as
much as you got for it."

"Eh? What's that?" asked the old man, with his hand to his ear, as if distrustful that it had
performed its duty correctly.

"Why, Bob has found the oil."

"Yes," added Dick, "and it shows up better than anything I ever saw around here."

"It is true, Mr. Simpson," said Ralph, as the old man still looked incredulous. "Bob found
signs of oil this morning, which he says are wonderfully good. I don't wonder that you can't
believe it, for I haven't succeeded yet, and I was with Bob when he found it."

"Oil on the wood-lot!" repeated Mr. Simpson, in a dazed sort of way.

"Yes, sir, and tanks of it!" replied Jim.

"I am more glad than I can say," replied the old man, fervently, "for now you and Mr. Harnett
will be rewarded for your generosity to an old man whom you hardly knew or cared for. It was
not to be that I should have it, and it wouldn't have done me much good if I had, for mother
an' I are most ready to leave this world, an' we haven't a child or a chick to be gladdened
by the money. Why, Mr. Gurney, I'm as pleased for you as if it was all mine."

And Mr. Simpson shook the boy by the hand in a hearty way that left no doubt of the truth of
what he said.

"But if there is oil there, Mr. Simpson, you own as much as George and I do, for we settled
on that yesterday."

"No, no!" and the old man shook his head decidedly. "When I sold the land, I believed I was
getting the full value for it, and you didn't care whether it was worth what you paid or not.
What you bought is yours, and there's no gainsaying that. I suspected there was somethin' more'n
wood on that land when I went to pay Massie the money, for when he found that I had the full
amount, he offered to pay me my price for the wood-lot, and when I told him I'd sold it, he
offered to give me the whole mortgage just for that piece of land."

"There!" exclaimed Ralph, as if Mr. Simpson had just told him something which it was to his
advantage to hear. "Now you can see why we should give you one-third of the land. If you had
come to us then, and told us that you had a better offer for it, we should have been only too
well pleased to give it up. Now, if what Bob says is true, you shall still own a third of the lot."

Mr. Simpson shook his head, to show he would not permit of such generosity, and Ralph did not
care to discuss the matter any further, for he and George had already decided what to do.

"If what Bob says is true!" cried Jim. "Why, there's no question about it, for there the oil
is where you can see it for yourself."

"Still, it may not turn out as he expects," objected Ralph, as if determined not to believe
in his good fortune; and the moonlighters, really angry at such obstinacy, refused to argue
with him any longer.

They insisted that Mr. Simpson should go with them to see the fortune that had been his, without
his being aware of the fact, and while they were away Bob returned.

He had two men with him, who appeared as intent on business as Bob did, for all three walked
past Ralph without speaking, going directly into the wood-lot.

During fully an hour, Ralph sat on the wood-pile, wondering if it could be possible that he
was wrong in refusing to believe what all the others seemed so certain of, and then Bob and
the men came back, accompanied by Mr. Simpson and the two moonlighters, all looking as if they
could hardly contain themselves because of joy.

"We will start the engine and lumber right up here, Mr. Hubbard," said one of the men, as he
passed Ralph, "and you can send for what you want, with the understanding that the owners of
the land will ratify all your bargains."

"Well, as for that, you can judge for yourselves, so far as one of the owners is concerned;
the other is not able to transact any business," said Bob, turning suddenly toward Ralph, and,
greatly to that young gentleman's surprise, saying, "Gentlemen, this is Mr. Ralph Gurney, who
owns one-half the property, as Mr. Simpson has told you."

"You are a very fortunate young man," said the gentleman who had been speaking with Bob. "You
authorize Mr. Hubbard to act for you, I suppose?"

"Yes, sir," replied Ralph, too much dazed to know exactly what he was saying.

"There! what did I tell you?" cried Bob, as Jim drove away with the men, in order to bring
the team back. "They will supply everything we need to open the well, and simply because they
have seen what you did not think was of very much account. I have hired the men to build the
derrick, and before you go to bed to-night you will have seen the work begun on your oil well."

"But, Bob," asked Ralph, in a tone that was almost piteous, and which sounded so comical, under
the circumstances, that even Mr. Simpson laughed heartily at it, "do they think the same about
it that you do?"

"Well, you heard what was said about supplying anything we needed, and people don't say such
things, even up this way, unless they mean them. Now we shall need some considerable money,
and I advise you to write to your father, telling him of what you own, and asking him to come
on here prepared to help you. If he won't do it I can get all the money we need; but we shall
have to pay considerable for the use of it."

Ralph made no objection, nor advanced any further argument; he was in that condition of mind
when he was not capable of any resistance, and he obeyed Bob's orders as meekly as if there
was no way by which he could refuse.

Ralph's letter was by no means one of such glowing description as Bob would have written. It
was a plain statement of facts, begun by an account of how he and George came to buy the property,
of the chase for the thieves, when they had their first intimation of the value of the property,
of the accident to George, of Bob's discovery, and lastly of the opinion of the Bradford merchants,
who were ready to supply, on credit, everything which was necessary for the opening of the well.

When the letter was read to Bob in its entirety, he did not disapprove of it, nor was he very
much pleased. All he ventured to say was:

"It is lucky for you, Gurney, that the oil showed up so plainly that those who know a gold
dollar when they see it were not so frightened about giving credit as you are about stating facts."

Then Dick was sent to Sawyer to post the letter, and while he was away the workmen whom Bob
had engaged had arrived.

Ralph went with him when he directed them to clear away for the erection of the derrick and
engine-house, and by the time the first load of lumber had arrived, he had begun to feel the
effects of the oil fever.

The preparations going on everywhere around, the comments of the workmen as they saw the show
of oil, the ringing blows of axes, and shouts of the teamsters, all lent an air of realism
to Bob's words which Ralph had failed to see or feel before.

It was for him, even though it had been against his wishes, that all these men were working,
and for him would accrue the profits, if indeed there were any.

Bob had been as good as his word; before Ralph went to bed that night he had seen the work
begun, and already was he beginning to feel that perhaps all Bob's predictions might be verified.

CHAPTER XXVI.

DRILLING AN OIL WELL.

There was no material change in George's condition on the morning after work had been begun
on the oil well. The physicians declared that he was getting along as well as could be hoped
for, and the nurse gave it as her opinion that he would recover much sooner than any one had
believed. Therefore, the boys were not troubled about their friend more than might be expected.

On this day, work was begun on the derrick, and, as may be imagined, all the boys were on the
spot to see it, Ralph's belief in the success of the venture growing stronger and stronger
as the framework arose in the air.

On the third day George's mother arrived, and the boys were thus relieved of all responsibility,
so far as the care of their friend was concerned.

It was on the evening of the same day that Mrs. Harnett came that Ralph's father arrived.

After receiving his son's letter, he had thought the matter of sufficient importance, somewhat
to Ralph's surprise, to warrant his paying a visit to the oil fields, and had written to Ralph
to meet him at Bradford.

Despite the fact that Bob could borrow on the strength of the property as much money as he
needed to carry on the work, he was very anxious to convince Mr. Gurney of the value of his
scheme, and on the day when that gentleman was to arrive, insisted that Ralph should go to
Bradford with him early in the afternoon, in order that he might be able to arrange with the
gentlemen of whom they were purchasing their supplies to meet Mr. Gurney, and tell him exactly
what they thought of the proposed well.

Thanks to Bob's activity, Mr. Gurney was able to see all those who had inspected the property
on that same evening, and was considerably surprised by these interviews.

After receiving Ralph's letter, he had thought that possibly the boys might have a site for
a well which would pay to open, and he had come on believing that it was not a matter of very
great importance.

When he had been introduced to Bob, and had heard that young gentleman's flowery description
of the vast amount of wealth which was only waiting to be brought to the surface of the earth,
he was disposed to look upon it as a visionary scheme, the value of which only existed in the
moonlighter's mind.

Bob had been accustomed to have his statements received in that same way, and for that reason
had arranged for Mr. Gurney to meet those whose judgment he could fully rely upon.

These gentlemen assured him that the well promised to be a rich one; that the signs of oil
were remarkably good, and that they had no hesitation in agreeing with Bob, as they had done,
to supply anything which might be needed to open the well.

Thus, even before he had seen the property, Mr. Gurney believed that his son was in a fair
way to enrich himself through his deed of charity.

In the present crowded condition of the Simpson farm-house Mr. Gurney could find no accommodations
for living there, and, since he was to remain in Bradford, the boys had made their arrangements
to remain there also over night, in order that they might take him out to the oil-well early
in the morning.

On the following day, Mr. Gurney drove out to look at the property. He saw that the work was
well under way, and heard sufficient from the workmen to convince him of the fact that every
one who had seen the place believed a well would yield plentifully.

Mr. Gurney's business would not permit of his remaining in the oil region but one day, and
when Ralph drove him to the depot that night, he gave him formal permission to draw on him
at sight for all necessary expenses.

After this, had it been possible, Bob would have hurried the work still faster along, but he
had already urged matters on as fast as possible, and all he could do was to insist on Ralph,
Jim and Dick doing as much work as one of the laborers, he setting the example.

The days went on all too short for the work that each one wanted to see done, and wearily for
the invalid, who was beginning slowly to recover. The fever had abated, and with the doctor's
permission, the boys had an interview with their friend, who had descended within the shadows
of the Valley of Death.

On the night when the derrick was completed, the engine placed and housed, and the drills in
position, ready for work, Bob and Ralph had a long and heated discussion as to whether George
should be told of what was being done.

Bob insisted that he should know nothing about it until the day on which they struck oil, while
Ralph argued that if it was such a certainty that oil would be found, George should be allowed
to share in the pleasure of digging for it.

Already had the young engineer begun to worry about the loss his business would sustain because
of his illness, and although he had not spoken of it, Ralph fancied he could see that he was
also troubled about the expense which he must necessarily be under.

All this, Ralph argued, would be taken from George's mind if he was told of what was being
done, and after a long discussion, Bob agreed that the important news should be told on the
following day, provided the physician agreed that the patient would not suffer from the excitement.

On the following morning, all the boys were at the proposed well before any of the workmen
arrived, in order that they might see the drills enter the ground, and by the time that important
ceremony was over, it was time for the physician to make his morning call.

When he did come, Ralph told him just what he thought George had on his mind, in the way of
trouble, and then stated what it was he proposed doing, in case there was no objection to it.

"Not the slightest objection, my boy," said the medical gentleman, heartily. "Good news seldom
kills, and from what I learn, it is only that which you have to tell. I think, as you do, that
it will benefit the patient, and you have my permission to unfold your budget of news after
I have dressed his wounds."

Half an hour later, the doctor had left the house, and Ralph and Bob entered the invalid's
room, as they had every morning since he had been able to recognize them.

In reply to their usual inquiry as to how he felt, George said, gloomily:

"I should feel all right if I only had a little more strength. It is hard to know that I shall
have to lie here a long time, simply waiting to get strong, and all the business I had succeeded
in getting, done by some one else. But perhaps I couldn't have kept what I had after that scrape
about the glycerine."

"All that is settled, George," said Ralph. "I persuaded them to call your case the next day
after you were hurt, when Bob's case came on. He and Jim and I told the story exactly as it
was, and you were acquitted, while he was fined ten dollars. I should have told you before,
but that we were afraid of exciting you."

"Such excitement would do me good rather than harm," said George, with a smile, "for I have
worried about that every day I have been here."

"Then I will give you more of the same sort, only better," replied Ralph, with a meaning look
at Bob. "The day after you were hurt, we hunted for the oil, and Bob found it just----"

"I should say we did find it," interrupted Bob, excitedly, and despite Ralph's warning looks.
"It is the richest spot you ever saw, and there's a thousand-barrel well there, if there's a drop."

George opened his eyes wide with astonishment, and then closing them wearily, he said:

"I'm willing to take your word for it that you found signs of oil; but I would rather hear
what some one else thought as to the size of the well."

"You shall hear," cried Bob, growing more excited, and forgetting all caution. "I brought Dodd
and Mapleson out here, and after they had looked at it, they said they were willing to advance
everything for the opening. Then we commenced work----"

"You commenced work?" cried George, attempting to raise himself in the bed, and falling back
from sheer exhaustion.

"Yes, George," said Ralph, as he motioned Bob to remain quiet. "Every one said we'd be sure
to strike oil, and Bob has started it for you. He had nothing to do for a while, and he wanted
to surprise you. I sent for father, and after he had talked with some of the men, he told us
we might draw on him for what money we needed."

George lay perfectly still and looked at Ralph as if he could not believe that which he heard,
and Bob, forgetting himself again, cried out:

"The derrick's already built, the engine's up, and we commenced drilling this morning. I tell
you what it is, Harnett, before you're able to get around again, we'll have a thousand-barrel
well flowing that you can call your own; and, as for engineering, why, you needn't worry your
head about that any more, for you'll have all the money you want."

CHAPTER XXVII.

"THE HARNETT."

It surely seemed as if the good news which Ralph and Bob had imparted to him was all that was
needed to cause George's rapid improvement. From the day when they had told him of what they
had done and were doing, his recovery was so rapid that at the end of a week he was sufficiently
strong to sit up a short time each day, and the physician predicted that in another week he
would be able to take a walk out of doors.

Meantime, the work at the well had progressed most favorably. There had been no serious breakages,
no vexatious delays, no trouble of any important character. In fact, the workmen expressed
it as their conviction that it would be a "lucky well," because of the singular freedom from
accidents with which the entire work had been attended. Bob was in the highest possible state
of excitement all the time. Each morning he anticipated that they would have some trouble which
would delay them, when he was anxious to have the work completed as soon as possible, and each
night, after matters had gone on smoothly, he held forth to George and Ralph of the wonderful
"luck" they had had, which must be taken as an augury of that which was to come.

Ralph divided his time equally between George and the scene of operations. In the early morning,
he would walk out to the well, stay there an hour, and then return to report progress, continuing
his alternate visits to the well and the invalid, until George knew as much of what was going
on as if he had superintended it.

Now, every oil well is christened with some name, which is supposed to be suggestive of the
manner in which it has been discovered, or to do honor to some person who may or may not be
interested in it; therefore, it is not to be supposed that a name for this pet of Bob's had
not been discussed even before work had been begun on it.

Each one of the boys had proposed some appellation, Bob's favorite being "The Invalid," in
honor of George, and because, as he said, it had really had a chance of an existence through
Harnett's illness, for he stoutly contended that had the senior owner been well, he would have
been so cautious about opening it on credit, that all of them would have grown gray-headed
before they saw it flowing.

Jim and Dick thought that, since Bob had really been the one to open it, in case oil was struck,
it should be called "The Moonlighter," in honor of the one who had done all the work, when
there was no chance that he could be benefited by its success.

George wanted to call it "The Gurney," and his suggestion gave to Bob and Ralph just the name
the well should bear in case it answered their expectations in regard to its yield.

"We will call it 'The Harnett,'" said Ralph, more decidedly than he had yet said anything in
regard to the "scheme," and since Bob was in favor of this, it came to be considered a settled
fact that that should be the name. After that conversation, old Mr. Simpson never spoke of
it save as "The Harnett," and the boys soon learned to follow his example, until even George
gave it that title.

Work went on rapidly, until the drills were boring eight hundred feet below the surface, and
it was hourly expected that bed-rock would be struck, when George broached to Ralph a matter
he had had on his mind from the hour he first learned that "The Harnett" was being opened.

"Do you remember, Ralph, what we said about giving Mr. Simpson a share in the land if oil was
found there?" he asked, when Ralph came in to tell him that the rock had not been struck, but
that Bob believed it would be before night.

"Yes, and I still think we ought to do so," replied the junior partner, quickly. "After he
had taken our money, Massie offered to give up the whole of the mortgage for a deed of the
wood-lot, and he refused, for he considered himself bound to us, even though he knew we only
bought it to help him along."

"And what about Bob?" asked George, meaningly. "What he says about our hesitating to begin
work before we had money of our own to carry it through, is nearly true, and if oil is struck
there we shall have him to thank for it."

"I know that, and I have been meaning to talk with you about it. Why can't we give Mr. Simpson
and him an equal share with us? I think they really ought to have it."

"So do I, and my proposition is that we give to each of them an undivided fourth of the entire
property, they to share equally with us in everything."

"And I agree to that fully," replied Ralph, quickly. "I have wanted to propose something of
the kind, but was afraid you wouldn't agree to it, because of Bob's being a moonlighter, and
having given you so much trouble."

"But if 'The Harnett' is a success, we must attribute it all to the trouble Bob made for us.
If the team hadn't been stolen we should not have been in Bradford to meet Mr. Simpson, and
if it hadn't been for the theft we never should have imagined that there was any oil on the
property. Besides, if Bob owns an interest here, you'll find that he won't do any more moonlighting."

"Well," said Ralph, anxious that their good intentions should be carried into effect as soon
as possible, "when shall we give them their share? Now, or after we find whether there is oil
in 'The Harnett?'"

"Now. You drive right into town, have the deeds made out, and bring them here so that I can
sign them with you."

It was early in the day, and Ralph would have plenty of time to make all the arrangements and
yet be back before the drilling ceased, unless, of course, the rock was struck almost immediately.
Therefore he started at once, refusing to answer any of the questions which Mr. Simpson and
Bob put to him as to what had called him in town so suddenly.

Of course neither of those whom he had left in an aggravated suspense could have any idea of
his errand, and his sudden reticence after he had been in the habit of telling them all he
was going to do, mystified them considerably, Bob in particular being greatly exercised over it.

"I hope Gurney hasn't got on his ear about anything," he said, to George, after he had watched
Ralph drive away. "He's gone into town as glum as a judge, and won't say a word."

"What makes you think there is anything the matter?" asked George, with a smile. "Have you
and he been having any trouble?"

"Not that I know of, except that he might have got cross when he was at the well, and thought
I ought to have treated one of the proprietors with a little more deference. I was helping
set the drills when he came out last, and I'm not sure but that I spoke sharply when I answered
his questions; but I didn't intend to."

"I guess there's nothing the matter with him," said George, rather enjoying the moonlighter's
perplexity, knowing how soon it would be ended. "You probably were a trifle cross, when he
was there, and, being guilty, fancied that he spoke or acted differently from usual."

"I didn't fancy it, for he was queer. I asked him where he was going, and so did Mr. Simpson;
but he wouldn't answer either of us."

"I'll find out what the trouble is when he comes back, and let you know," replied George.

And with this answer, Bob went back to his work, thinking it very singular that Ralph, who
had always been so good-natured, should have suddenly become so crusty.

Twice during the remainder of the forenoon, Bob came to the house with some trifling excuse
for so doing, but really to learn if Ralph had returned; and while he was there the last time,
talking with George about the probabilities of striking sand or gravel rock, the junior partner
returned.

He had with him some official-looking documents, and, as he entered the house, he said to Bob,
speaking quite sharply without any intention of so doing, and yet resolving all the moonlighter's
suspicions into certainties:

"I want some witnesses to George's signature. Will you bring Mr. Simpson, Jim and Dick here?"

Bob arose silently to comply with the request, looked at Ralph wonderingly and reproachfully
an instant, and then left the room.

While he was absent, George told his friend of the moonlighter's trouble, and the two were
making merry over it, when he returned with the witnesses Ralph had asked for.

The papers were handed to George, who signed both of them, and then asked Jim and Dick to sign
their names as witnesses to his signature. Ralph had already signed them while in town.

Then, purposely taking considerable time about it, Ralph examined the documents as if to make
sure that all was correct, and said:

"Mr. Simpson, after George and I learned there was a chance that oil would be found on your
wood-lot, we agreed that you should share equally with us in whatever might come of it. For
that purpose I went into town, and have had a deed drawn up, giving you an equal share with us."

"But I don't want none of it," said the old man, in a trembling voice, while there was a suspicious
moisture in his eyes. "I sold the land to you as I'd a' sold it to anybody else, and whatever's
there you own."

"But the deed is made out now, and there is no use for you to protest against it," said George;
and, without giving the old man time to reply, he added, as he turned to Ralph: "Now I understand
that there has been some trouble between you and Bob, or he fancies there has."

Bob motioned to George to be silent; but it was too late, and Ralph said:

"The only trouble is that I chose to go away this morning without telling him where I was going.
Then I owned one-half of the wood-lot, with all there is or may be on it, and since it was
the last time I should have the right to do anything regarding it without his knowledge, I
refused to tell him where I was going. But now that he owns an equal share with you, Mr. Simpson
and me, he will have a perfect right to question me."

Bob looked up in blank amazement, but made no attempt to speak, and after waiting several moments,
during which no one save the two original partners seemed to understand the situation, Ralph
said, as he handed Bob one of the documents:

"Believing that but for you 'The Harnett' would not have been opened, at least for some time,
we have thought it best to divide the property into fourths, one of which belongs to you."

Perhaps for the first time in his life, Bob was unable to make any reply, and he walked quickly
out of the room to the wood-pile, where he sat for some time as if trying to make himself believe
that what Ralph had said was true.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

RED ROCK.

The idea that Ralph and George would voluntarily give him a portion of what he considered to
be very valuable property, was the farthest thought from Bob's mind. He had gone to work to
open the well simply because he was anxious to prove to those who had declared he knew nothing
about it, that there was a large deposit of oil where he had always insisted there must be.
If any one had said to him that he was entitled to any considerable reward because he had given
up his own business to improve the value of his friend's property, he would have said truly
that he had not neglected his own business, since just at that time there was no work for moonlighters
to do.

He had started in on the work with no idea of being paid for his services, although if oil
was found, and he had needed any small amount of money, he would not have hesitated to ask
for it. The work had been begun by him upon the impulse of the moment, and this making him
an equal owner in the well, simply because of what he had done, surprised him even more than
it did any one else.

It was after he had been sitting on the wood-pile long enough to understand why this property
had been given him, reading first the deed, and then looking toward the wood-lot, where he
could hear the sounds of activity, that he entered the house, where both his old and his new
partners were discussing, as they had ever since the work had begun, the probabilities of finding
oil.

"I tell you what it is, boys," he said to George and Ralph, "this thing ain't just straight.
You've got no right, in the first place, to give away a quarter of that property before you
know what it's worth, and then, again, if you paid me ten times over for what I've done, it
wouldn't amount to this. Now, if you think you'd feel better to pay me for my work, take back
this deed, and so long as I have charge of 'The Harnett,' give me one barrel in every twenty
you take out. That will be mighty big pay, and a good deal more than I am worth."

"But I suppose you'd be glad to own a portion of a well, Bob, and especially as big a one as
you insist this is going to be," said George.

"So I would like to own one, and I'd rather have this one quarter, so far as money goes, than
half of any well I know of. But you see this don't belong to me, for I haven't earned it, and
you haven't the right to give away so much."

"But we have given it away, and you can't insist upon the size of the gift, because none of
us know whether, instead of being a benefit, it will not saddle a debt on you of one quarter
of the expense of sinking the well," said Ralph.

"I know that it won't!" cried Bob, earnestly, "and so do we all, for we're sure of striking
a big flow."

"Well, Bob, you've got the deed," interrupted George, "and since we want to make you one of
the owners of 'The Harnett,' we'll say to you as we did to Mr. Simpson--you've got the deed,
and you can't help yourself."

Bob made no further reply; but five minutes later the boys saw him and Mr. Simpson perched
high up on the wood-pile, talking very earnestly about something, which they quite naturally
concluded was the gift they had just received, and on commenting upon it, Mrs. Harnett, although
she knew there was very little necessity for it, advised the boys to insist upon the acceptance
of the gift, for she believed both the recipients deserved what they considered such good fortune.

Both Ralph and George were perfectly satisfied with what they had done, and in an hour after
the presentation, all the partners were discussing the chances of striking oil, much as they
had every day before when two of them had no idea they were to become part owners.

The doctor's visits had grown less frequent since George had begun to recover so rapidly, and
it had been three days since he had seen the patient.

George had insisted that he was perfectly able to walk as far as "The Harnett," and would have
done so had not his mother and his friends urged so strongly for him to wait until he should
see the doctor again.

It was on this day, just after George had eaten what any one would consider a hearty dinner
for an invalid, that the physician called, and almost as soon as he appeared, George asked
his opinion about his taking a little out-door exercise.

"I see no reason why you should not do so," replied the doctor, "providing you may be trusted
to act as your own physician, and come in before you get tired."

This George was positive he would be able to do, and almost before the doctor had left the
house, he was planning a visit to "The Harnett," but that his mother objected to at once, since
it would be impossible for him to ride, and it would be much too long a walk.

He was anxious to see the work, but, under the pressure of advice from all his friends, he
consented to defer seeing "The Harnett" until later, and take a ride with Ralph instead. The
horses were harnessed into his own carriage, which was made even more comfortable than ever
by a profusion of Mrs. Simpson's pillows, and, assisted by all, the invalid started for his
first out-door exercise since the murderous assault upon him.

George wanted to drive through Sawyer, for since he had been cleared of the charge against
him, he was anxious to meet his friends there, and Ralph willingly drove in that direction.

Upon arriving at the town, there was every reason to fear that he would not get as his own
physician, as the doctor advised, for he was warmly welcomed by every one, whether stranger
or friend, until his reception was a perfect ovation. Over and over again was he thanked for
the assistance he had rendered during the conflagration, and the congratulations on his recovery
poured in on every side.

Among the cordial welcomes he received, none was more hearty than that from the officer who
had arrested him the night he was starting in pursuit of the horse-thieves, and from him Ralph
and George heard some news which interested them.

The men who had committed the assault were in the jail at Bradford, awaiting their examination,
which was to take place as soon as their victim's recovery was certain, and the officer asked
when George would be able to appear as a witness.

The senior owner of "The Harnett" had no desire, even then, that these men should be punished,
but since the matter was one in which he could have no choice, and since he would be obliged
to attend the examination, he declared that he could go at as early a date as might be set.

Evidently anxious to have the matter off his hands as soon as possible, the officer said:

"Then if you feel able to drive into town to-morrow, we will hold the examination. It will
not take very much of your time, and if in the morning you do not feel able to attempt it,
don't hesitate to send me word, and it shall be postponed."

"I don't think there is any doubt but that I shall be here," said George.

And then, after bidding the kindly-disposed officer good-by, he confessed to Ralph that he
should be obliged to return home.

The meeting with so many in town had tired him more than the ride of two hours could have done,
and Ralph began to blame himself for having permitted him to stay so long, even though he could
hardly have prevented it if he had tried.

But during the ride back, the weary look on the invalid's face disappeared under the refreshing
influence of the quiet drive, and by the time they turned into the lane which led to the Simpson
farm-house, he looked quite as bright as when he started.

The lane was nearly a quarter of a mile long, and when they first entered it, Ralph was aware
that something unusual had occurred, and he trembled lest some accident had happened, but as
soon as he could distinguish them more plainly, he understood that the gathering was caused
by joy more than sorrow.

Bob, Jim and Dick were standing in front of the house, surrounded by some of the workmen from
the well, and Mr. and Mrs. Simpson were hurrying from one to the other, much as if they were
serving out refreshments.

"What can be the matter?" asked Ralph, anxiously, as he hurried the horses along. "Do you suppose
they have struck oil already?"

"No, that couldn't be possible," replied George. "I rather fancy that Bob and Mr. Simpson are
celebrating the happy event of being admitted to the ownership of the well."

Ralph was satisfied that such was the case, and he pulled the horses in, unwilling to arrive
at a scene where he feared he might be obliged to listen to thanks for what they had done.

Before many minutes, however, the boys could see that those at the house were shouting to them,
and when they arrived within hearing distance, they recognized Bob's voice, as he shouted:

"Bed-rock! bed-rock!"

And then went up a shout from all that was nearly deafening.

"They have got through to the rock," cried George, his pale face flushing with excitement.

And in a moment the carriage was surrounded by partners and workmen, as each one tried to tell
the good news that the drills had struck the rock at a depth of eight hundred and forty feet.

"What have you found?" asked George, as soon as he could make himself heard.

"Sandstone," replied Bob, "and we shall be obliged to try glycerine."

"The moonlighters will open the moonlighter's well!" cried Dick, as if an immense amount of
sport was to be had from such an operation.

"Indeed the moonlighters shall have nothing to do with it," replied Bob, with no small show
of dignity, and to the great surprise of all. "There'll be no sneaking around to shoot this
well, I can promise you that, for we'll have her opened in the daylight, squarely, or not at all."

Jim and Dick could hardly believe that which they heard. That their old partner, one of the
most successful moonlighters in the oil regions, should object to having a well, in which he
had a quarter interest, opened as he had opened wells for others, was something too incredible
to be true. There must have been some mistake about it, they thought, and they would shoot
the well by moonlight as soon as Bob should consider the matter more fully.

But all this time George was still in the carriage, and as soon as the boys realized this,
they began to make arrangements for helping him out, content to wait to tell the good news
more fully after he should be in his room once more.

CHAPTER XXIX.

THE EXAMINATION.

Beyond the fact that the drills had struck the rock, and that it was of such a nature that
they could not work in it, but would necessitate the use of glycerine, but little more remained
to be told after that first announcement.

But yet all the boys crowded into George's room and insisted on trying to tell him something
new regarding the important fact.

The drills had struck the rock very shortly after Ralph and George had started out, and in
their rejoicing that the work was so nearly over, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson had insisted that all
hands should come to the house, where a generous luncheon of preserves and bread and butter
was passed around in honor of the happy event.

That was all any of them could tell, and then came the question of shooting the well, Jim and
Dick looking anxiously at their former partner to hear him retract those words so traitorous
to moonlighting generally.

Both Ralph and George were as glad as they were surprised to hear Bob exclaim against having
moonlighters open "The Harnett." They would have opposed any such proposition had he made it;
but since he himself objected to it, the matter was simple enough.

"I will drive down to town to-night and arrange with Roberts Brothers to send a man up here
to-morrow," said Bob, "and before to-morrow night we will know just what 'The Harnett' is worth."

"But, Bob," cried Dick, "you don't mean to say that after we have shot the well that you're
goin' to pay them more than it's worth for doin' it no better than any of them can."

"That's just what I do mean to tell them, my son," replied Bob, with a mingled air of authority
and patronage.

"Why?"

"Well, in the first place, it will avoid any trouble. In the second place, it don't look well
to be sneakin' 'round as moonlighters have to do, and in the third place, we want 'The Harnett'
opened square."

"But you always said moonlighting was square, and that you wouldn't even let the regular men
come near a well of yours," urged Jim.

And from his tone it was easy to understand that this opening of "The Harnett" was a matter
upon which he and Dick had quite set their hearts.

"That was before I owned an interest in a well myself, boys," replied Bob. "Mind you, I don't
say now that moonlightin' isn't square, for I believe it is; but when it's such a stunner of
a well as this that's to be shot, I say that it hain't best to give anybody a chance to raise
a question about it."

It was evident to all from that moment that Bob Hubbard, the oil producer, was to be a very
different sort of a party from Bob Hubbard, the moonlighter, and all save his old partners
were delighted at the change.

"Then have you given up moonlightin' entirely, Bob?" asked Dick, with a world of reproach in
his voice.

"Indeed I have," was the emphatic reply. "I'm still ready to say that it's all right and legitimate;
but I'm through with it."

"Then, just for the sake of old times, Bob, an' seein's how we haven't come into possession
of quarter of an oil-well, let us open your well for you," pleaded Jim.

And all present understood that he and Dick, having been interested in the well from the time
it was first discovered, were anxious to do something toward opening it.

"I'll tell you how it can be done," said George, desirous of granting Jim and Dick the very
slight favor which they asked, and yet quite as unwilling as was Bob that the work should be
done in any way which could be called illegal. "Bob can go to the torpedo people, pay them
for the charge, get the cartridges and glycerine, with the express understanding that he is
to do the work himself. That would make matters right all around, and you can fancy that you
are moonlighting again."

It was a happy thought, this one of George's, and every one present, even including Mr. Simpson,
hailed it with joy. It was an arrangement which would please all of them very much better than
to have any strangers doing the work, and Bob would have started at once to attend to it, if
Ralph had not stopped him by telling him of the examination which he would be obliged to attend
next day.

"Since you will be obliged to go with us, you had better wait until to-morrow. You can have
the tubing started on the road at the same time, and on the next day we can shoot the well,"
suggested George.

Bob was not at all inclined to wait forty-eight hours when half that time would suffice to
decide whether "The Harnett" was a wonderful success or a dismal failure; but since he would
be obliged to be present at the examination, which would occupy a portion of the day, he tried
to content himself as best he could.

The remainder of that day was spent in discussing plans for the future, Bob entering into a
profound calculation of the amount of material they would need to build a tank, for he was
so certain they would strike oil, that he would have had no hesitation in beginning work on
the tank even before the well was opened.

On the following morning, George was feeling so well and looking so bright that there could
no longer be any fear he had over-exerted himself the day before, and preparations were begun
at once for the ride into town.

Ralph and George were to drive in with the latter's team, while the old firm of moonlighters,
with Mr. Simpson, were to go in Bob's double-seated wagon. Everything was taken which it was
thought the invalid might need, and the party started, all of them wishing the journey had
some other motive than that of assuring punishment to others, even though they were guilty.

On arriving in town, they were met by the officer whom they had spoken with the day before,
and he told them, after they had found a comfortable seat in the court-room, of all that had
been learned of the prisoners.

Their names were William Dean and Henry Ramsdell, and they had worked for some time in Oil
City for a civil engineer there. By this means they had learned the oil business, and had shown
an especial aptitude for prospecting. There they committed what may or may not have been their
first crime, for no one knew where they had lived before they appeared in Oil City. They robbed
their employer of nearly two hundred dollars, and it is probable that it was after that money
was spent that they had stolen George's team.

The examination did not last very long. George told of the theft of his team, of his pursuing
the thieves, in company with Ralph and Bob, and of all that occurred up to the time he left
his companions to go to Mr. Simpson's for his instruments.

"Then," he said, "when I had got nearly half way from where I had left my friends at the house,
these men stepped from among the bushes directly in front of me, and one demanded the paper
which I held in my hand. I refused to give it to him, and as I did so, before I had time to
act on the defensive, the elder of the men struck me full in the face. I at once began to defend
myself, but it was two to one, and in a very short time a blow on the head from some hard substance
felled me to the ground, unconscious."

That was all George could tell, and Ralph and Bob were both called to the stand to testify
to what they knew, both of the theft of the team and of the finding of George.

Mr. Simpson, Jim and Dick were also ready to testify as to the condition of George when they
found him and when they carried him into the house, but their evidence was not needed then,
nor was the doctor's, who had examined and attended the wounded youth.

Beyond asking one or two unimportant questions of each witness, the accused had nothing to
say for themselves, or in contradiction of what had been testified to, and the judge committed
them without bail for trial at the next term of court.

As soon as the examination was over, Bob went to the office of the torpedo works, and there
contracted for the necessary amount of material to "shoot" the well, and also stipulated that
he be given permission to do the work.

At first this was refused peremptorily, on the ground that it was a dangerous operation, and
that he would probably succeed only in killing himself.

Bob understood at once that he was not recognized, and he asked if Mr. Newcombe was in the
building. That gentleman was in, and appeared very shortly after he was sent for, greeting
Bob as heartily as if they had always been the best of friends rather than enemies.

"Mr. Newcombe, I have come for an eighty-quart charge, with the stipulation that I can work
it myself in the well on the Simpson farm, of which I own one quarter. This gentleman refuses,
because he is afraid I may kill myself. Won't you vouch for my skill in the matter?"

"Indeed I will," was the hearty reply; "and if you will buy all your charges in the same manner,
I shall have very much less work to do."

"I've stopped all that work now," said Bob, solemnly, "and so far as I am concerned, you won't
have another night's drive for moonlighters."

Of course, after Mr. Newcombe's introduction, Bob had no difficulty in gaining the desired
permission, and he joined those who were waiting for him outside, happy in the thought that,
as he expressed it, "'The Harnett' would have a chance next day to show what she could do."

CHAPTER XXX.

LEGAL MOONLIGHTERS.

When the boys arrived at the Simpson farm-house, after the close of the examination, there
was very little they could do save talk over that which was to be done on the morrow, when
the value of "The Harnett" was to be decided.

A portion of the tubing to be used in case there was any flow of oil, was already on the ground,
and the remainder would be hauled by noon of the next day at the latest. There were no cartridges
to prepare, for the Torpedo Company's workmen would attend to all that, delivering both the
tin cases and the glycerine ready for use.

Everything was done that could be, and in a few hours more the casing of rock, which might
or might not cover a large deposit of oil, would be blown out.

As sanguine as Bob had been from the first that a large yield of oil would be found, he was
exceedingly nervous now that the time for the question to be settled was near at hand. Not
but that he was still as positive as ever that they should strike oil, but he began to fear
that it might not be found in such quantity as he had imagined.

He would talk for a few moments with the boys, then find some pretext for going to the well,
over which a guard had been set to prevent any evil-disposed parties from tampering with it,
and once there he was quite as eager to get back to his partners as he had been to leave them.
In fact, he was in the highest degree nervous, and had not the others been afflicted in a similar
way, they would have noticed his condition.

Mr. Simpson was in such a disturbed mental condition that he went about his work in a dazed
sort of way, until his wife insisted on his sitting on the wood-pile, where if he did no good
he could at least do no harm, while she did the chores for him.

On hearing Bob say, for at least the tenth time since he returned from town, that everything
was all right at the well, the old man did "pull himself together" sufficiently to do the milking,
and then no sooner had he performed that task than he forgot what he had done, and tried to
do the whole work over again, remembering his previous accomplishment only when one of the
cows kicked the empty pail over, and very nearly served him in the same way.

Jim and Dick were not as anxious regarding the yield of the well; therefore, they were in a
state of excitement only because they were to be at what would be very nearly their old moonlighting
tricks again, and were simply impatient for the time to come when they could be at work.

They spent their time sitting on a rather sharp rail of the fence, bemoaning Bob's obstinacy
in not having the well shot in regular moonlighter's fashion, without being so weak-kneed as
to buy the right to do simply what no one ought to be allowed to prevent him from doing.

Ralph and George were inwardly as excited as any one else, but outwardly very much more calm.
They sat in the latter's room, talking over the prospects of striking a goodly quantity of
oil, while, despite all they could do, the conversation would come around to what the result
would be in case "The Harnett" proved to be a dry well. They knew that all the bills had been
contracted in their names, since they were the sole owners at the time the work was commenced,
and in case of a failure, they would find themselves burdened with such a load of debt that
it would take them a very long time to clear it off.

Even at that late hour they regretted that Bob had commenced to sink the well, and it is extremely
probable that if it had been possible to undo all that had been done, leaving the land exactly
as it was before the signs of oil were discovered, they would gladly have agreed to forego
all their dream of wealth.

Whether Mrs. Harnett and Mrs. Simpson also suffered from suspense that evening it is hard to
say; but certain it is that they were more silent than usual, and the former sewed remarkably
fast, while the latter's knitting-needles clicked with unusual force.

It was a trying time for all in that house. Had it been daylight, when they could have been
at work, the hours would not have seemed nearly as long; but, in the evening, the time passed
so slowly that it almost seemed as if there was a conspiracy of the clocks, and that their
hands were only moving about half as fast as they should have done.

Then came the night, when every one went to bed and tried to sleep; but three in that household
succeeded very badly, and who those three were may be very easily imagined.

Next morning, every one was up so early that the hens were frightened from their roosts half
an hour before their regular time, and the breakfast had been eaten fully an hour before it
was customary to begin to prepare it.

George showed the effects of his anxiety very plainly, and had his mother not feared the suspense
would be worse for him than the fatigue, she would have tried to induce him to remain in the
house instead of going to the well as had been agreed upon.

Bob, who had visited the scene of operations before breakfast, again announced that "everything
was all right," and that one more load of tubing would give them sufficient.

Under the pretext that there were a great many things which it was necessary for him to attend
to, while everyone knew he was simply inventing work for the purpose of hiding his anxiety,
he insisted that Ralph, Jim and Dick should help George out to the well when he was ready to
come, and then he hurried away.

The charge would not be exploded until nearly noon, and on the night before it had been agreed
that George should not venture out until a short time before the decisive moment; but now that
the time was so near at hand, he could not remain in the house, and the result was that his
mother and Ralph agreed he should go at once.

An easy chair was carried out in the grove, and placed at a safe distance from the well, but
where he could have a good view of what was going on. Then, with Ralph at one side, Dick at
the other, Mrs. Simpson ahead, carrying a foot-stool and a fan, and his mother in the rear,
with a bottle of salts and an umbrella, the cortege started, its general dignity sadly marred
when the party were obliged to climb the fence.

Bob was nowhere to be seen when the invalid and his attendants arrived at the reserved seat,
but before he was comfortably seated the superintendent came up with another announcement that
"everything was all right," and aided them in disposing of George.

He was comfortably seated under a large tree, with Mrs. Harnett and Mrs. Simpson on either
side of him, and, so far as could be judged, was quite as well off there as he would have been
in the house. Once he was where he could see what was going on, and viewing the works for the
first time, the haggard look left his face, thus showing the wisdom of his friends in not preventing
him from coming when he wanted to.

The first arrival, after the spectators had assembled, was the last load of tubing, and Bob's
only trouble was, or he professed that it was, that they would lose so much oil before they
could make arrangements for storing it.

As the time went on, Bob was the only one who had anything to do, and those who watched him
insisted that he simply did the same work over and over again.

Finally, when every one began to fear that the Torpedo Company had entirely forgotten their
contract, a wagon, similar to the one owned by Bob, drove up with the long tin tubes on the
uprights, and the box evidently stored with the dangerous liquid.

In an instant the moonlighters were changed boys. All their nervousness or listlessness was
gone, and in its place a bustling, consequential air that was almost ludicrous.

All three of the boys helped unload the wagon, and when the driver attempted to do his share,
they plainly told him that all he would be allowed to do was to fasten his horses, if he wanted
to see the operation, or to drive away if he was not interested in it. He chose the latter
course, and, save for the workmen, the party most interested in "The Harnett" were left alone.

Bob critically examined the cartridges, making many unfavorable comparisons between them and
the ones he had been in the habit of making, and then began the work of fastening the reel
to the derrick, as well as setting the upright in position, which served as a guide to the
rope that was to lower the cartridges in position.

When that was done--and the moonlighters did not hurry in their work, anxious as they had been
before, for they were determined that this last shot of theirs should be a perfect success--the
more delicate task of filling the cartridges was begun.

There were four of these, each capable of holding twenty quarts, and the spectators were not
wholly at their ease, as can after can of the explosive fluid was poured into these frail-looking
vessels, even though the moonlighters handled it much more carefully than Ralph had seen them
handle that which had been used at the Hoxie well, on the famous night when Mr. Newcombe guarded
their hut for them.

As each tube was filled, the boys lowered it into position in the well, and the nervous anxiety
which had assailed them the night before again took possession of Ralph and George.

At last everything was ready for the launching of the iron bolt, which was to call into activity
the explosive mass, that was to shatter the rock under which it was hoped the oil was concealed.
The moment had come when the value or worthlessness of "The Harnett" was to be decided.

CHAPTER XXXI.

THE SHOT.

It is barely possible that when Bob stood over the aperture with the iron poised in his hands
which was to be the means of opening to them the mystery of the well, there was just a shade
of fear at his heart that he had been mistaken in the signs, and that an upward rush of water,
would be all that would follow the explosion.

His partners noted a look of almost painful hesitation on his face for an instant, and, then,
as it vanished, he dropped the go-devil, retreating to where the group of anxious watchers
were gathered around George's chair.

The seconds that followed the dropping of the iron were wonderfully long ones, and it seemed
as if each one present ceased to breathe, as the time had come when the value or worthlessness
of the well was to be decided.

Then was heard three distinct reports, somewhat louder than had been heard at the Hoxie well,
because of the charge being nearer the surface of the earth, and this was followed by the black,
noisome vapor that wreathed slowly around the aperture as if sent by the demons of the earth
to keep back those venturesome mortals who would seek to penetrate their secrets.

No one spoke, and each eye was riveted upon the mouth of the well, to read there the story
which was soon told. First came a shower of water, breaking into drops as it reached the surface,
sparkling in the sun like diamonds, and then uprose, not slowly and waveringly as Ralph had
seen it once before, but shooting quickly in the air, a transparent, greenish column of oil,
that broke amid the timbers of the derrick, shattering into splinters the smaller joists and
scattering them in every direction.

It was clearly and unmistakably oil, not in any small quantity, or sent with any slight force;
but a discharge which, from its volume and intensity, showed how vast was the reservoir from
which it had come, how great the strength of confined gas that sent it heavenward.

For nearly five minutes the spectators sat watching the flow of oil which told of the value
of "The Harnett," until Bob broke the spell that bound them, by shouting:

"Hurrah for 'The Harnett!' Hurrah for petroleum!"

In an instant all present, even including George, burst into loud shouts of welcome to the
long-confined and valuable product of the earth which was theirs.

During the thirty minutes that the new well spouted, congratulations were poured in on Bob
from all sides, for through his efforts had this work been done, and without him it might have
been many years before such a scene would have been witnessed on the Simpson wood-lot.

The partners hardly knew how to express their joy. George was quietly happy; but the unusual
brilliancy of his eyes and the flush on his cheeks told of the deep but suppressed excitement
under which he was laboring. In that steady upward flow of oil he saw a competency for himself
and his mother, which he had not dreamed he should secure during many long years of toil, and
as he clasped her fervently by the hand, she knew that it was of the many things this well
would produce which would add to her comfort that he was thinking.

Old Mr. Simpson and his wife stood with clasped hands, looking at the representation of wealth
which was pouring out before them, and in their eyes, even as they gazed, was a far-away look,
as if they were thinking of their loved ones who, when on this earth, had been deprived of
many of the necessaries of life, while wealth beyond their wildest imaginings lay beneath their
very feet.

Ralph was laboring under the most intense excitement, which he strove vainly to suppress. He
had not, like George, been obliged to battle with the world for those things which money can
buy; but he saw before him a course already marked out, which he had believed he would be obliged
to struggle very hard to reach.

Now he was rich, and all those things he had desired could be his.

Jim and Dick were loud in their demonstrations of joy that their last shot had produced such
magnificent results; but their old partner, Bob, outstripped them all in loud rejoicings. He
had demonstrated beyond the possibility of an argument that his location of the oil belt in
the vicinity was correct, and he had done so even as against the theories of those older and
more experienced in the business than himself.

In addition, one-quarter of all this was his, and he was what he had long dreamed of being--an
oil producer.

The length of time which the well flowed demonstrated the fact that, if it would not produce
a thousand barrels of oil per day, the yield would not fall far short of that, and when it
finally ceased flowing, Bob was transformed into the steady, hard-working superintendent he
had been since the work was first commenced.

It was necessary that something be done at once to save all this oil which was now going to
waste, and he directed the workmen at once how they should begin.

Unknown to his partners, Bob had already made arrangements for the building of a tank, and,
as soon as the workmen were engaged with the tubing, he started Jim off to town with a message
to the contractors that no time might be lost in getting at the work.

Before Jim left, Ralph gave him a message which he wanted him to send to his father. It was
short, containing only these words:

    "Well just opened. Good for eight hundred barrels per day."

On reading it, Bob insisted that the eight hundred should be changed to one thousand, since
that would probably be nearer the actual yield; but Ralph let it remain as it was, preferring
to be two hundred barrels short of the actual yield rather than two hundred barrels over.

Mrs. Harnett persuaded George to return to the house as soon as the first flow had ceased;
and, aided by Ralph and Mr. Simpson--for the others were too busy to be able to help him--he
went back, fancying, as soon as he was away from the well, that he had dreamed of the wonderful
things he had seen, and that it could not be a reality.

His friends were not certain whether he had been injured or benefited by the excitement; but
he was so thoroughly tired out when he reached his room that he was obliged to go to bed at
once, and there he fell into a long, sweet sleep, from which he did not awaken until evening.

As may be imagined, everything was in the greatest state of activity around "The Harnett" during
the remainder of that day and all the night, making ready to save the oil which then was being
lost, and before the morning came, those who were working at the well decided that even Bob's
estimate of a thousand barrels was too small.

"The Harnett" was flowing at the rate of twelve hundred barrels of oil per day, and that represented
at least as many dollars, although the price of oil might fall much lower than it then was,
when the supply exceeded the demand.

"If there is anybody that thinks now that the oil-belt don't extend up this way, I should like
to have them come up and take a squint at 'The Harnett.' She's spouting like a daisy, and I
knew she would, from the first," said Bob, as he came in to breakfast next morning, after having
worked all night, his joy so great that he did not even feel the fatigue.

George seemed almost well on this morning, and he took his seat with the others at the breakfast-table,
much as if he was as strong as any of them, while his looks did not belie his actions.

"I knew you'd be well this morning," said Bob, gleefully, "for no matter how weak you were,
such a sight as you saw yesterday would put the strength into you."

And then the ex-moonlighter's tongue rattled on as if it had, as motive power, a greater force
than that which sent the oil up through "The Harnett."

Bob was as full of business as ever on this morning. By common consent, and without the necessity
of any conversation on the matter, he had been tacitly accepted as superintendent, and it was
not possible for him, just then, to spend many idle moments.

Already had the work on the tank been begun, and until it was finished, "The Harnett" would
be connected with an empty one, about two miles away, the tubing being already nearly in position.

Bob had sent, the night before, for more workmen, and he confidently expected that by night
all the product of "The Harnett" could be saved.

Old Pete, who had acted as a sort of watchman and guard for Bob when he was a moonlighter,
had been sent for to fill a similar position at the well, and very many schemes were in progress.

A house was to be built for the accommodation of the workmen, and this Bob insisted Ralph should
attend to at once, as it was needed sadly.

Mr. Simpson was charged with making a road to lead from the highway to the well, and since
George was not strong enough to do any other work, he was made book-keeper and cashier, as
well as general financier.

Jim and Dick were both hired by the owners of "The Harnett," one to act as general messenger
and clerk to George, and the other for such important duties as the partners might not be able
to attend to.

In fact, before sunset of the day after the well had been opened, each one of the owners was
hard at work, and when they had ceased their labors for the day, gathering in George's room,
now turned office, for a chat, Bob rather startled them by the information that it was his
purpose to sink another well close by the house, as soon as he should get matters straightened
out at "The Harnett."

CHAPTER XXXII.

MASSIE'S SCHEME.

During the following week, matters went on very smoothly at the well newly opened on Mr. Simpson's
wood-lot.

George had continued steadily to improve, and looked quite like his old self, so much good
had prosperity done for him. His mother, recognizing the fact that she could no longer be of
service to him, and feeling not exactly at home in the rather limited accommodations which
the Simpson house afforded, had gone home, while the three boys had settled down as regular
boarders, or, rather, guests at the Simpson farm.

The road had been built, the house for the workmen was well under way, and the tank completed.
By having this storage place near at hand, the value of "The Harnett" could be definitely settled,
and it was found that the well was producing a trifle over twelve hundred barrels of oil every
twenty-four hours.

The money which Mr. Gurney had advanced had already been repaid, and it was George's intention
to settle for the machinery and tools in a few days more, for they were all anxious to be free
from debt.

Ralph's father had replied to the telegram by a letter of congratulation, and had promised
to come up there to see the property before Ralph's vacation had expired, for it was by no
means the young oil producer's intention to neglect his studies. While the other partners attended
to the work at the well, it was his purpose to return to college to finish the regular course
he had started on.

It did not seem possible that, now the well was open and flowing so freely, anything could
happen to prevent them from becoming wealthy, and that in a comparatively short time; but from
this dream of fancied security they were destined to be rather rudely awakened.

One morning, when they were all at the well, while Bob was trying, as he had every day since
he first saw oil from "The Harnett," to convince them of the wisdom of boring another well
just outside the limits of their own property, but on that of Mr. Simpson's, which was entirely
at their service, two men drove up directly in front of them.

Visitors had been so plenty at the well, that neither of the partners paid much attention to
these new arrivals. Every one near there had heard Bob Hubbard's predictions that the oil belt
embraced Mr. Simpson's property, but without believing him, and when the news went out that
he had struck a twelve-hundred-barrel well just where every one believed there was no oil,
it seemed as if the people must see it before they could be convinced it was really there.

Almost a constant stream of visitors had been at the well from the day it was opened, and Bob,
believing these two men had come simply to assure themselves that what others had said was
true, paid no attention to them, but continued his argument with George, as showing how they
could open another well further down the gully that should pay as well as this one.

"Can we see Mr. George Harnett and Mr. Ralph Gurney?" asked one of the men, as both advanced
toward the lucky owners of "The Harnett."

"Those are the gentlemen," said Bob, carelessly, as he pointed to George and Ralph, and then
turned away to attend to some work, believing the visitors had only idle questions to ask.

"And are you Robert Hubbard?" asked the second man, stepping in front of Bob in such a manner
as to prevent his leaving the place.

"I am."

"And this, I presume, is Mr. Daniel Simpson?" continued the man, as he pointed to the fourth
partner, who had not yet gotten over his surprise at seeing oil flow on his land.

"It is," said Bob, sharply. "Is there any one else around here you wish to see? If there is,
call the roll now, for we have nothing else to do but stand up for inspection."

"You four are all we have any business with just now, although in a few moments we shall want
to see all who are at work here," said the man who had first spoken; and then, as he produced
an official-looking document from his pocket, he added, "Here is an injunction from the court,
restraining you from trespassing any further on this property, and from removing anything from
it. Here, also, are summonses for you to appear in a suit for ten thousand dollars damages,
brought against you by Marcus Massie."

"Massie!" exclaimed Bob, while the others looked at the documents in speechless astonishment.
"What have we got to do with him? We don't owe him any money."

"He claims that you have damaged him to the amount named by opening this well without his knowledge
or consent," replied the man.

"Well, I like that!" cried Bob, angrily. "Of course we opened it without his knowledge or consent,
and perhaps you can tell us why it would have been necessary to consult him about it. What
has he got to do with us?"

"Since the well is on his land, and since you have been converting the oil to your own use,
he thinks he has a great deal to do with it," replied the second man, who looked very much
like a lawyer, while the other was evidently an officer of some kind.

"His land!" cried George; and then all four of the partners looked at each other in a dazed
way, as if they had suddenly been deprived of the power of speech.

"Yes, his land," replied the lawyer. "He had a mortgage on all this property, which he foreclosed,
and he proposes to take possession of the house at once."

"But--but I paid that mortgage!" cried Mr. Simpson, in a trembling voice. "I paid that mortgage,
and have got it now."

"Yes," was the quiet reply. "I understand that by some means you have got the instrument itself
in your possession, but if you had got it because you had paid the amount due, you would have
received and had recorded a release from Mr. Massie. Have you got that?"

"A release!" repeated the old man, in bewilderment. "I don't rightly understand you. I paid
my money and got the mortgage. Wasn't that enough?"

"If you had paid the money," replied the lawyer, with a decided emphasis on the first word,
"you would have received a release, and that would have been recorded with the mortgage, otherwise
that instrument is in full force."

"But I paid it! I paid it!" wailed the old man.

"I know you did, Mr. Simpson," said George, sternly, "and so does Massie. This is a sharp trick
on his part to force us into buying his imaginary claim off, for he tried very hard to get
hold of this property in the first place, and would have succeeded if he had not tried to get
too much. We will consult a lawyer at once."

"In the meantime, gentlemen," said the lawyer, "I warn you against removing any more oil, or
interfering in any way with my client's property."

"I don't suppose you have got an order of the court to prevent the well from flowing, have
you?" asked Bob, angrily, making what seemed such unnecessary movements with his hands, that
the lawyer stepped several paces backward very quickly.

"This officer will remain in charge of such property as you may own here, since it is attached
by Mr. Massie," said the lawyer, evidently thinking it best for him to depart, and getting
into the carriage with a celerity that hardly seemed possible in one of his age.

"Oh, he will, will he?" cried Bob, savagely. "Well, I shall stay here in charge of him, and
I promise you he won't do anything more here than the law permits him to."

"What can we do?" asked Ralph, as the lawyer drove away, and the officer sauntered around the
premises like one who already owned them.

"I don't know what we can do now, except to go into town and consult a lawyer. There is no
question but that Massie is trying a little sharp practice, and if it is a possible thing,
he will get the best of us," said George. "Ralph, you and I will go into town, while Bob stays

bad team.
 Mr. Simpson paid the money-lender all the
money he had borrowed; but not knowing anything of the beautiful intricacies of the law, which
gives a semblance of legality to such a theft as this, neglected to ask for a release of the
property. After oil was discovered here, Massie saw a chance to steal the property, and he
has hired you to do what he doesn't dare to do himself. If I so much as thought I was as contemptible
as you show yourselves to be by trying to do this dirty work, I would go and drown myself in
the most stagnant pool I could find."

Bob's speech had quite as much effect upon the men as the sight of the clubs had had, and they
retreated toward their teams, protesting that they did not know the facts of the case when
they started out.

It was in vain that the lawyer who had accompanied them insisted that they were only doing
what his client had a legal right to ask them to do; in vain that he urged them to enter on
the property regardless of those who tried to prevent them.

Bob had made them feel ashamed of the part they were playing, and before Ralph, who had outstripped
the others in the race, arrived, they were in their wagons, insisting that they would have
nothing more to do with the matter.

The lawyer scolded and shouted himself hoarse, trying to oblige them to do as he coaxed and
commanded, but all to no purpose. They were determined to return, and they plainly told him
that unless he came with them, they should drive away without him.

Under this pressure, which he could not control, the lawyer was obliged to obey those whom
he had vainly attempted to command, and the party drove away, leaving Bob the well-earned title
of conqueror in this first battle of Mr. Massie's.

But after all danger, so far as this party was concerned, had disappeared, Bob was by no means
inclined to relax his vigilance. He stationed his men in the positions he had originally intended
they should occupy, supplied each of them with a generous lunch, with the addition of hot coffee,
and even gave a portion to the solitary officer at the well, when he had originally intended
that he should go hungry.

After that was done, and after he had cautioned them to be watchful, impressing on the minds
of Ralph, Jim and Dick the necessity of mistrusting every one whom they might see approaching
the farm, Bob went back to the house to consult with Mr. Hillman and George.

There some especially good news awaited him. It seemed as if this direct attack on Massie's
part had restored Mr. Simpson to something near his presence of mind, and, aided by his wife,
who had always found scolding efficacious when he relapsed into absent-mindedness, had succeeded
in recalling the events on the afternoon when he paid the money-lender the five hundred dollars
which he had had so much difficulty to raise.

He now distinctly remembered that when he entered Massie's office a man by the name of Jared
Thompson, formerly an old neighbor of his, was there, and that his first words were to the
effect that he had brought the money to pay off the mortgage.

The old man was equally positive that he had laid the amount on the money-lender's desk in
the presence of this same man, and that Massie had then offered to buy the wood-lot. How much
more might have been said while Thompson was there he was not certain, but of that much he
was positive.

Mr. Hillman was overjoyed at the news that there had been a witness to the repayment of the
money, but when he asked where the man could be found, he was disappointed in the reply.

Mr. Thompson had lived on the next farm to Mr. Simpson's, but when he left it, he went to Bradford,
and from there it had been said that he had gone to Babcock. Where he was living at that time
Mr. Simpson neither knew nor did he know of any one else who might be acquainted with Mr. Thompson's
whereabouts.

"If we can find this man, and if he heard what Mr. Simpson thinks he did, then the case will
be clear enough, for we shall have a witness to the payment of the money, which, I think, will
be sufficient to explode Massie's claim."

"We must find him," was Bob's reply.

And just then he felt able to find any man, however hard he might try to hide.

"Yes, but how?" asked Ralph, who had come in at the close of the conversation.

"I don't know exactly," said Bob; "but there must be a way. George can be spared better than
any one else. Let him harness his horses and start out. He can stay away until he finds him."

"I think the best way would be to make inquiries at Bradford, and from there you might be able
to track him," suggested Mr. Hillman. "Just remember that with this man everything will be
plain sailing, and that without him Massie may get the best of us, and I am confident you will
bring him back with you."

"And above all things, George, don't give up the chase because you think we may need you here.
Just remember that we can get along as well without you and spare neither time nor expense
in the search," said Bob.

George was perfectly willing to start in pursuit of the missing witness, and at once made his
preparations for the journey.

Fortunately he had with him as much money as he would be likely to want, and to harness his
horses and to gather up such things as he might need was but the work of a few moments.

"Don't come back without your man!" shouted Bob, as George drove away.

And the defenders of "The Harnett" and the Simpson farm were left alone to await the coming
of Mr. Gurney, and of George with the missing witness.

All of them feared that Massie's next attempt to gain admittance would be made under the cover
of darkness, and to prevent this from being successful Bob went to work.

First he sent one of the men on his horse to Sawyer to purchase a number of lanterns, and while
the messenger was gone he got from Mrs. Simpson all the blankets and comfortables she had.

It was his purpose that half his men should sleep at their posts during the night, while the
others watched, in order that they might be able to continue sentry duty for any length of
time, and he also proposed that each one on guard should carry a lantern, that both he and
any one who might meditate an attack, would know those in possession of the property were still
on the alert.

This done, the inmates and guardians of the farm were ready for the coming of the night.

CHAPTER XXXV.

MASSIE'S FAILURE.

Although Bob had taken so many precautions against the coming of the enemy during the night,
they were all useless, since neither Mr. Massie nor any one in his employ appeared at the Simpson
farm.

"Well," said Bob, next morning, while he was waiting for Mrs. Simpson to prepare the breakfast
for the sentinels, "since they didn't come during the night they'll most likely be here to-day,
so it won't do for us to grow careless."

As the day wore on, and nothing was seen of the force which it was believed would appear, Ralph
said to Bob:

"If father started as soon as he got my telegram, he ought to be here on the train to-night,
and some of us must drive into town for him."

"That's true, and you must be the one to go," replied Bob, decidedly. "You can take my team,
and if any one comes while you are gone, we shall get rid of them, I guess."

Since Mr. Hillman wished to go to his office for some law-books and papers before Mr. Gurney
arrived, Ralph started off with him about noon, leaving the farm with the often-expressed wish
that nothing would happen during the absence of three of the defenders.

"If you mean by that that you're afraid some of Massie's men may get in here, you're mistaken,"
said Bob, stoutly. "Unless we have a mind to let them, which isn't at all likely, there won't
one of them get a chance to so much as show his nose inside."

Now that Mr. Simpson had succeeded in gathering his scattered faculties once more, and understood
that everything might yet be well with them, he seemed suddenly to have grown young again,
for he was as eager in watching for approaching danger as Bob was.

"Don't fear for us!" he shouted, as Mr. Hillman and Ralph drove down the lane. "We can keep
a regiment of them at their distance," and he acted much as if he believed all he said.

It was about two hours after Ralph and the lawyer drove away, when Bob was honored with another
visit from Mr. Massie's messengers, but this time they did not come in sufficient force to
cause any alarm.

The lawyer and two men drove up to the lane, where Bob, having seen them while they were yet
some distance away, had a force of five men, and the following conversation took place:

"I am instructed by Mr. Marcus Massie, the rightful owner of this place, to take possession
of it at once, and to order you off the grounds as trespassers," said the lawyer. "Do you intend
to prevent us from an exercise of our legal rights?"

"I intend to prevent you from coming in here," replied Bob, "and I warn you now that I will
seriously injure the first one who attempts to come on to this land, which belongs to Mr. Simpson."

"I have made the demand upon you," continued the lawyer, in an unruffled tone, "and I tell
you now that my client will proceed against you if you thus attempt by force to prevent him
from the exercise of his just and lawful rights."

"Your client may proceed to do whatever he can, and just as soon as he can, and if my answer
has not been sufficiently plain, I tell you again that none of you can come in here."

And Bob made a demonstration with his club which appeared to convince the lawyer that he would
have no hesitation about using it on his precious body.

"I have warned you," said the legal gentleman, viciously, "and now you can take the consequences."

"And I have warned you!" cried Bob, "and I'm certain that you will take the consequences if
you attempt to come here, where neither you nor your client have any rights."

With this pleasant conversation, the lawyer and his companions drove away, and once more was
Bob master of the situation.

The next arrivals to the disputed property were Mr. Gurney, Mr. Hillman and Ralph. The former
had started as soon as he had received his son's telegram, and from the look on Ralph's face,
it was easy to see that the two lawyers, after a consultation together, did not consider the
situation a desperate one.

"Father says that even if George doesn't succeed in finding Thompson, he believes it will be
possible to show to the satisfaction of a jury that Mr. Simpson paid off the mortgage," said
Ralph, as the two lawyers entered the house, leaving the boys alone in the stable-yard. "Of
course if this witness could be found, everything could be settled at once."

Ralph's father was also able to do something for the immediate relief of the owners of "The
Harnett."

On the morning after his arrival, and the guardians of the property had been undisturbed during
the night, Mr. Gurney and Mr. Hillman went into town, where they succeeded in getting bondsmen
for the boys, thus releasing the property from attachment. They also began a suit against Mr.
Massie, to restrain him from taking any further steps in the matter until the question of ownership
could be decided at law.

While they were absent, George returned, and with him was the missing witness, Mr. Jared Thompson.
He had been found at Babcock, and since he had no business on hand he was perfectly willing
to accompany George, and all the more so because he had been promised he should be well paid
for his time, which, just then, was of no value to him.

He remembered distinctly seeing Mr. Simpson at Massie's office, and of seeing him pay over
a large roll of money, which he stated was the amount of the mortgage. He also heard Massie
say, after he had counted the money, that it was "all right," and saw him hand Mr. Simpson
the mortgage, which he took from his safe. 

The dimension of the hill is estimated at 1,000 feet, and it contains two spacious series of caves.
A magnificent access, 250 feet above and 100 broad, which gives admittance to this series,
is on the level with the river buzzword, and, on entering, you lose yourself
in a small and lofty chamber well understand from high by the distinct
shut space, through which can be known a entrance to the upper series
of caves, the 400 to 500 bottom up the elevation side. Some first collection
is on the "land floor" and is lighted as Hitam Simud, or "white porch."


He also gave Bob an order to the keeper of the property at the well, recalling him from his
disagreeable duties, and the ex-moonlighter had the pleasure of escorting the officer to the
main road, happy that they were once more in possession of their own.

Then, of course, Mr. Gurney was shown the wonderful well, and listened, long and attentively
to Bob's arguments as to why another well should be sunk near the house. To the surprise of
all the partners except, perhaps, Bob, Mr. Gurney advised that that scheme be carried out,
saying that Bob's argument seemed to be supported by such facts in the case as were apparent
even to those unfamiliar with the business.

Bob was highly delighted at having convinced Ralph's father of the feasibility of this scheme,
and Mr. Simpson was so impressed by the celebrated lawyer's advice that he insisted on deeding,
that very night, the strip of land, on which it was proposed to sink the well, to the firm
of Harnett, Gurney, Hubbard & Simpson.

Mr. Gurney insisted that the other three partners should pay to Mr. Simpson their proportion
of the valuation of the land, which would have been several thousand dollars; but the old man
would listen to no such proposition. He had been presented with a quarter of the wood-lot when
he had no claim upon it, and he urged his right to make the firm a present of as much land
as he owned.

There was no necessity of watching the farm that night, although Bob thought it was careless
to leave it unguarded; but no harm came to it, nor did they even hear from the worthy Mr. Massie.

Bob lost no time in setting about the work of opening the new well, and his first duty next
morning was to set a portion of the men at work making ready for the erection of the derrick.

Fortunately for the boys, the court was already in session, and Massie's claim came up for
an early hearing.

It seemed as if the old money-lender must have entirely forgotten that there had been a witness
to the payment of the money, for he came into court apparently confident that he should be
able to call "The Harnett" his own; but as soon as he saw Thompson, all his confidence vanished,
and he sneaked out of court even before the case was fairly opened.

Of course, there could be but one decision, under the circumstances, and in less than an hour
from the time the case was called, a verdict had been given in favor of Mr. Simpson, who was
advised by the judge to demand of Massie a written release, and there was no longer any question
as to the ownership of "The Harnett."

So far as Ralph was concerned, the case had been decided none too soon. It was time for him
to return to college, and on the next day, in company with his father, he bade his partners
adieu for a year, as he returned to his studies. Men. Half. Climate did not have been unhealthy

Ramsdell and Dean were convicted of the assault on George, and sentence of two years in the
State prison pronounced against them, the charge of stealing the team still hanging over their
heads, in case George wants to press it when their term of imprisonment has ended, which is
not probable.

While Ralph was finishing his collegiate course, Bob worked at the new well, and when it was
opened, he telegraphed to Ralph:

    "New well just shot. Another victory for the moonlighter, for it
    is not more than two hundred barrels less than the other."

And Ralph replied:

    "I claim the right to name it. It shall be called 'The
    Moonlighter.'"

When Ralph graduated, he owned a quarter of three good, paying wells, and Bob has now an idea
that it will pay to open another some distance away, where he has been prospecting for the
past month.

Mr. and Mrs. Simpson still live on the old farm, and George, Ralph and Bob live with them;
but a new house has been built by the side of the old one, for the old couple would not consent
that their first home should be torn down, and at any time that the readers visit that section
of the country, they should not fail to look at "The Harnett," which still flows as it did
during Ralph Gurney's vacation.
