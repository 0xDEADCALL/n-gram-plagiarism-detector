EDITORIAL NOTE.

The following Papers originally appeared in the Art-Journal, for which they were specially
written. They are from the pen of that painstaking and accurate archæologist, the late F. W.
FAIRHOLT, F.S.A. The illustrations also were engraved from original sketches by the Author.
It has been suggested that the results of so much labour and research should be still further
utilised; and that the merit and value of these Essays entitle them to a more lasting form
than is afforded by the pages of a magazine. The Editor confidently believes that the popular
style in which these articles are written, and the fund of anecdote and curious information
they contain, will render them acceptable to a large number of general readers.

A second series of Art-papers, by the same Author, is in the press, and will shortly be published,
under the title of “Homes, Haunts, and Works of Rubens, Vandyke, Rembrandt, and Cuyp; and of
the Dutch Genre-Painters.”

CHAPTER I.

Long after the extinction of the practical art-power evolved from the master-minds of Greece
and Rome, though rudely shattered by the northern tribes, it failed not to enforce from them
an admission of its grandeur. Loving, as all rude nations do, so much of art as goes to the
adornment of life, they also felt that there was a still higher aim in the enlarged spirit
of classic invention. It is recorded that one of these ancient chieftains gazed thoughtfully
in Rome upon the noble statuary of the fallen race, and declared it the work of men superior
to any then remaining, and that all the creations of such lost power should be carefully preserved.
The quaint imaginings of uncivilised art-workmanship bore the impress of a strong but ruder
nature; elaboration took the place of elegance, magnificence that of grandeur. Slowly, as centuries
evolved, the art-student came back to the purity of antique taste; but the process was a tardy
one, each era preferring the impress of its own ideas: and though the grotesque contortions
of mediæval statuary be occasionally modified by the influence of better art on the Gothic
mind, it was not till the revival of the study of classic literature, in the fifteenth century,
that men began to inquire into the art of the past ages, and endeavoured to obtain somewhat
of its sacred fire for the use of their own time. The study was rewarded, and the style popularly
known as that of the Renaissance rapidly spread its influence over the world of art, sanctioned
by the favour of such master-minds as Raphael, and the great men of his era.

It was not, however, to be expected that any style should be resuscitated in all its purity
without the admixture of some peculiarity emanating from the art which adopted it, and which
was more completely the mode of the era. The Renaissance is, therefore, a Gothic classicality,
engrafting classic form and freedom on the decorative quaintnesses of the middle ages. Fig.
1 is as pertinent a specimen as could be obtained of this characteristic: the Greek volute
and the Roman foliage are made to combine with the hideous inventions of monkery, the grotesque
heads that are exhibited on the most sacred edifices, and which are simply the stone records
of the strife and rivalry that prevailed between monks and friars up to the date of the Reformation,
and are therefore of great value to the student of ecclesiology and ecclesiastical history.
In this instance they seem to typify death and hell, over whom the Saviour was victorious by
his mortal agony: the emblems of which occupy the central shield, and tell with much simple
force the story of man’s redemption. Mediæval art has not unfrequently the merit of much condensation
of thought, always particularly visible in its choice of types by which to express in a simple
form a precise religious idea, at once appealing to the mind of the spectator, and bringing
out a train of thought singularly diffuse when its slight origin is considered.

The easy applicability of the revived art to the taste for fanciful display which characterised
the fifteenth century, led to its universal adoption in decoration; but the wilder imaginings
of the living artist always tampered with the grand features of the design. The panel, Fig.
2, is an instance. The griffins have lost their classic character, and have assumed the Gothic;
the foliations are also subjected to the same process. The design is, however, on the whole,
an excellent example of the mode in which the style appeared as a decoration in the houses
of the nobility, whose love of heraldic display was indulged by the wood carver in panelled
rooms rich with similar compartments.

Heraldry, with all its adjuncts, had become so great a passion with the noble, that the invention
of the artist and student was taxed for badges and mottoes by noble families. The custom flourished
most in Italy, where the impresa of a noble house spoke to the eye at once, whether it was
found on a sword-hilt or over a church-door. We give as an instance, in Fig. 3, that adopted
by the bold Dukes of Burgundy, sovereigns in their own dominions, and exciting much terror
of rivalry in the minds of the kings of France themselves. Their badge, or impresa, was indicative
of their rude power; a couple of knotted clubs, saltier-wise, help to support a somewhat conventional
figure of the steel used for striking the flint to produce fire; the whole surmounted by the
crown, and intended to indicate by analogous reflection the vigour of the ducal house. As a
bold defiance, a rival house adopted the rabot, or carpenter’s plane, by which they indicated
their determination to smooth by force the formidable knots from the clubs of the proud rulers
of Burgundy.

The art of enamelling, which had reached a high degree of perfection in the Roman era, was
refined upon in the middle ages, and ultimately its character was so much altered thereby that
it ended in rivalling painting, rather than retaining its own particular features, as all arts
should do. It may be fairly considered that originally it was used simply to enrich, by vitrified
colour, articles of use and ornament. Metal was incised, and the ornamental spaces thus obtained
filled with one tint of enamel colour, each compartment having its own. By this means very
brilliant effects were often produced, all the more striking from the pure strength of their
simplicity. It was not till the twelfth century that an attempt at floating colours together
was made, and this led ultimately to a pictorial treatment of enamel which destroyed its truest
character. The very old form was, however, practised in the latest days of its use; and our
engraving of the very beautiful knife-handle designed by Virgil Solis at the end of the sixteenth
century (Figs. 4 and 5), was intended to be filled with a dark blue enamel, in the parts here
represented in black, while the interstices of the cross-shaped ornaments above would receive
some lighter tint of warmer hue. The birds and foliage would be carefully engraved, the lines
of shadow filled with a permanent black, thus assuring a general brilliancy of effect. Such
knives were by no means an uncommon decoration of the table at the period when this was designed:
it is now a branch of art utilised until all trace of design has gone from it; for we cannot
accept the slight scroll work and contour of a modern silver knife-handle as a piece of art-workmanship,
when we remember the beautiful objects of the kind produced in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, gorgeous in design and colour, and occasionally enriched by jewels or amber.

There is one class of ancient manufacturing art which has been revived for the use of the modern
world with considerable success. We allude to the Roman works in mosaic, which have furnished
designs for our encaustic tile-manufacturers and our floor-cloth painters. Quaint and peculiar
in its necessary features, it is singularly well adapted for artisans in both materials. There
is also a great variety in the ornamental details of ancient pavements, at home and abroad;
the geometric forms being at times very peculiar, as in the specimen we give in the previous
page (Fig. 6), which has been selected from one discovered at Aldborough, in Yorkshire (the
Isurium Brigantum of the Romans), a lonely spot, containing many traces of its ancient importance,
and which has furnished an abundance of relics for the notice of the antiquary from the days
of Camden, who describes it with that happy brevity that accompanies full knowledge. The pavement
we engrave may be seen in full coloured detail in Mr. Ecroyd Smith’s volume on Isurium; the
borders placed on each side are portions of other pavements from the same place, selected as
showing the commonest and the most unusual patterns. The variety and beauty of design and colour
in encaustic tiles adopted by mediævalists, may be slightly illustrated by the quaint specimen
of foliation copied in Fig. 7. The conjunction of four such tiles produces great variety in
pattern, and excellent contrasts of colour.

Geometric form, in all its endless variety, was particularly studied in the Middle Ages, and
decorative enrichments of all kind subjected to its ruling control. We add two specimens of
glass-painting (Figs. 8 and 9), which are in reality the same design slightly varied in the
disposition of the tints, and the interlacing of the double or strap-lines of one, while the
other has them single only. The striking variety that any given design may elicit, by a mere
rearrangement of this interlaced work, or by a different disposition of the coloured compartments,
will at once be apparent; it was worked out with singularly good effect by the older artists
in decoration of all kinds. The key (Fig. 10) and the latch (Fig. 11) are examples of quaint
old Gothic metal works. The latter is copied from the old Hôtel de Ville of Bruges; the dragon
is used as a lever to lift the latch, and is one of those grotesque imaginings in which the
old art-workmen frequently indulged.

When the Dukes of Urbino, dazzled with the brilliancy of the Moorish potters, had determined
to rival their workmanship in manufactories upon their own principality, the so-called Raffaelle-ware
soon afterwards fascinated the Italians, by the quaint design and beautiful colour of the dishes
and vases there produced. Though popularly named after the great painter, it was unlikely that
he had aught to do therewith; but his designs were occasionally adapted to its use by the workmen.
The circular plateau (Fig. 12) is a good example of the bold character and vigour of effect
occasionally produced in these works.

Wood panelling we have already alluded to, and the large amount of decoration it occasionally
displayed. Fig. 13 is a beautiful instance of the grace that characterised the style known
as the Flamboyant, from the flowing or flame-like curve adopted for the leading lines. In this
instance they are happily blended with the earlier Gothic cusps, and the quaint ivy-leaves
that spring easily out of the severer lines. The ease with which heraldry may be introduced
in the design, gave it a peculiar charm to our ancestors; in this instance the shields bear
the sacred monograms--a purpose to which they were very commonly devoted in the church; sometimes
being further enriched with religious emblems, as terse and striking as the heraldic ones we
have given in a previous page.

We give two small drawings of cabinet-handles in Figs. 14 and 15, part of the elaborate fittings
of a piece of furniture which occupied the place of honour in the state-rooms of the wealthy,
and upon which the art of the day was generally lavished with a most liberal hand. Ivory, ebony,
and the rarest woods were employed in their construction, occasionally plaques of lapis lazuli,
or coloured marbles, were used for the panels; ultimately the whole surface became an encrusted
mosaic of figures, birds, and flowers, in coloured wood and stone, occasionally framed in the
precious metals. The gorgeous taste of Louis Quatorze excited the fancy of the ébenistes of
his court to the most costly invention. Furniture inlaid with engraved metal-work, or embossed
with coloured stones, oppressed the sense of utility; and when tables, chairs, and picture-frames
were made of silver, chased and overloaded with the scroll-work he so abundantly patronised,
common sense seems to have yielded its place to mere display. Despite of the costly character
of such works, and their destination as the decoration of a palace, they are positive vulgarisms,
and we feel little regret when we read in history of the disastrous wars at the close of the
king’s career, which obliged him to melt down the silver furniture of Versailles, and convert
it into cash for the payment of his soldiers.

There was more honesty of purpose in the old art-workers, who never swerved from a leading
principle. Hence the educated eye can at once detect a piece of genuine old decorative furniture
from a Wardour Street made-up bit of pseudo-imitation. It must be borne in mind that specimens
of genuine old work are by no means common; the abundance which this street and other localities
can supply to order by the cart-load, are ingenious adaptations of fragments of old work pieced
and placed together for a general effect; but which are sometimes ludicrous, from the mixture
of bits of all ages and style in one cabinet or sideboard. Some twenty years ago the city of
Rouen was a mine of wealth to furniture makers. The elaborately carved panels and chimney-pieces
in the stately houses of the old Norman capital, were converted into all kinds of articles
for domestic display. The progress of “improvement,” as well as the slower process of decay,
have cleared that place of many of its fine features of domestic architecture; but its beauties
have had an enduring memento in the curious volumes by the artist Langlois, of Pont-de-l’Arche,
completed after his death by M. Delaquérrière. In this work every ancient building is carefully
noted and described, throughout every street of the city; and the finest or most curious examples
engraved with a minute truthfulness for which Langlois was justly celebrated; and which drew
forth the plaudits of Dr. Dibdin, in the sumptuous work devoted to his foreign tour in search
of rarities.[15-*]

We propose presently to follow the Doctor in his investigation of old books, and exhibit some
few of the enrichments that artist and engraver gave to the written or printed volumes which
passed from their hands; at the same time we shall endeavour to take a more general survey
of the adaptation of art to works of ordinary use.

The quaint manner in which letters were sometimes braced together may be seen in Fig. 16. Occasionally,
a name thus formed in monogram would require much ingenuity to unravel, inasmuch as the entire
letters made but one interlaced and closely compacted group, each limb or portion of a letter
helping also to form part of another. In the hospital founded at Edinburgh by the famous goldsmith,
George Heriot,--the favourite goldsmith and jeweller of James I., a monarch who fully appreciated
his art,--the name of “Jingling Geordie,” as his majesty playfully called him, is sculptured
in such a group, which appears at first sight an enigma few could unravel; indeed, without
knowing what letters to look for, and how to arrange them, it is a chance if they would be
arranged correctly. Such a mode of marking would, however, have its advantages, for it would
enable those who were in the secret to unravel the mystery of the true proprietorship of any
valuable article unfairly abstracted. The shields in Fig. 13 are filled with monograms less
elaborate, but bearing a sufficient affinity to those alluded to, to aid in understanding the rest.

CHAPTER II.

We owe the term illumination, as applied to the decoration of old manuscripts, to the mediæval
Latin name of the artist himself, alluminor, the root of our English word limner, and of the
French word enlumineur, one who colours or paints upon paper or parchment, giving light and
ornament to letters and figures. The brilliancy and beauty of much of this ancient art are
marvellous to look upon, but the names of few of the patient artists, who devoted their lives
to book illustration, have descended to us. There are, however, one or two names well-known
to us, a Julio Clovio and a Girolamo da Libri (Jerome Veronese), affording a sufficient warrant
of the high-class minds who honoured their art by honouring literature. There can be no greater
pleasure than in turning over the matchless pages of these old volumes, and seeing them reveal
the passages of the poet or romancist, as understood by the men of the Middle Ages, to whom
they were addressed, or giving us pictures of life and manners of which we possess no other
record. Their value as adjuncts to books, when simply decorative, is now very generally acknowledged;
and the ladies of the present day rival the cloistered recluses in labouring, like them, to
enrich a cherished volume. It is, however, the art of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
that is now especially imitated, and the reason is to be found in its showy elaboration of
design and colour. There is an earlier style that presents strong claims to attention, that
of the two preceding centuries, specimens of which are given in Figs. 17-21. In them will be
noticed the Orientalism that occasionally prevails, and shows its Byzantine parentage; a trace
of the Greek volute and acanthus leaf is visible in Figs. 20 and 21; in the others we seem
to look on Turkish design. The applicability of such fragments of ornament is manifold.

When the art of engraving aided the press in producing works of a decorative order, we occasionally
turn over pages in which the master-minds of the day taxed their powers of invention. The old
wood-engravers were supplied by designers with drawings of the best class, and very quaint
and original are the ornaments which embellish the books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,--particularly
such as were published in Germany, or at Lyons, the latter city being then most eminent for
the taste and beauty of its illustrated volumes, the former for a bolder but quainter character
of art. There are useful hints to be had in the pages of all, for such as would avail themselves
of minor book-ornament. To render our meaning more clear, we select a series of scrolls (Figs.
22-25) for inscriptions from German books, of the early part of the sixteenth century, and
which might be readily and usefully adapted to modern exigencies, when dates or mottoes are
required either by the painter or sculptor. Ornamental frameworks for inscriptions abound in
old books, and are not unfrequently of striking design and peculiar elaboration; we give an
example in Fig. 26, from a volume dated 1593, as an excellent specimen of this particular branch
of design. Such tablets not unfrequently headed the first page of a volume, and received in
the centre the title of the book. The wood-engraver is thus the legitimate successor of the
older illuminator.

A large demand was made on the imaginative faculties of the designers of that day by the metal-workers,
the gold and silversmiths, the jewellers, and all connected with such decorative manufactures
as the luxury of wealth and taste calls into exertion. The name of Cellini stands prominently
forth as the inventor and fabricator of much that was remarkable; the pages of his singular
autobiography detail the peculiar beauty of many of his designs; the Viennese collection still
boasts some of the finest of the works so described, particularly the golden salt-cellar he
made for Francis I. of France. The high art which he brought to bear on design applied to jewellery
was followed by other artist-workmen, such as Stephanus of Paris, and Jamnitzer of Nuremberg.
The metal-workers of the latter city, and of Augsburg, had a universal reputation at the close
of the sixteenth century for their jewellery and plate, particularly the latter. They kept
in employ the best designers of the day, and such men as Hans Holbein, Albert Aldegræf, Virgilius
Solis, and a host known as the “little masters,” supplied the demand with apparent abundance,
but it could only be satisfied by the multiplication of these designs by means of the engraver’s
art. Hence we have at this period, and the early part of the seventeenth century, an abundance
of small engravings, comprising a vast variety of designs for all articles of ornament; and
from them we have selected, in Figs. 27 and 28, two specimens of those intended to be used
in the manufacture of the pendent jewels, then so commonly worn on the breast of rich ladies.
These jewels were sometimes elaborately modelled with scriptural and other scenes in their
centre, chased in gold, enriched by enamel colours, and resplendent with jewels. The famed
“Grüne Gewölbe” at Dresden have many fine examples, in the Louvre are others, and some few
of a good kind are to be seen in the Museum at South Kensington. The portraits of the age of
Francis I. and our Queen Elizabeth, frequently represent ladies in a superfluity of jewellery,
of a most elaborate character. The portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots, in our National Portrait
Gallery, is loaded with chains, brooches, and pendants, enough to stock the show-case of a
modern manufacturer. This love of elaborate jewellery was a positive mania with many nobles
in the olden time. James I. was childishly fond of such trinkets, and most portraits represent
the king with hat-bands of jewels, or sprays of jewellery at their sides. His letters to his
favourite, Buckingham, are often full of details of the jewels in which his majesty delighted.

Perhaps no article of personal ornament has exhibited a greater variety of design and decorative
enrichment than the cross. It has at once been made an embellishment and a badge of faith.
We select in Fig. 29 one of singular elaboration and beauty, now the property of Lady Londesborough.
It is a work of the early part of the sixteenth century; the ground is of frosted gold, upon
which is a foliated ornament in cloissonné enamel of various colours. It is also enriched with
pearl and crystal; the lower part of this cross is furnished with a loop, from which a jewel
of value might be suspended.

By way of curious contrast, as well as to show the style of various ages in the article of
necklaces, we give, in Figs. 30 and 31, two examples of widely different eras. The upper one
is that of a Roman lady, whose entire collection of jewellery was accidentally discovered at
Lyons, in 1841, by some workmen who were excavating the southern side of the heights of Fourvières,
on the opposite side of the Seine. From an inscribed ring and some coins deposited in the jewel-box,
the lady appears to have lived in the time of the Emperor Severus, and to have been the wife
of one of the wealthy traders, who then, as now, were enriched by the traffic of the Rhone.
The necklace we engrave is of gold, set with pearls and emeralds; the cubical beads are cut
in lapis lazuli, as are the pendants which hang from others. This love of pendent ornament
was common to all antique necklaces, from the days of ancient Greece to the end of the sixteenth
century. Our second specimen is an illustration of this: it is copied from the portrait of
a lady (bearing date 1593), and composed of a series of enamelled plaques, with jewels inserted,
connected with each other by an ornamental chain.

We have already alluded to the constant demand on the inventive faculty of the art-workman
for articles of all kinds in the olden times; nothing was thought unworthy his attention. We
give a selection of articles of ordinary use which have received a considerable amount of decorative
enrichment. The spur-rowels (Figs. 32 and 33), from the collection of M. Sauvageot, of Paris,
are remarkable proofs of the faculty of invention possessed by the ancient armourers. So simple
a thing as a spur-rowel, in our days of utilitarianism, would seem to be incapable of variety,
or at least unworthy to receive much attention. It was not so in past times, when workmen even
delighted to adorn their own tools. We engrave an armourer’s hammer (Figs. 34 and 35), from
the collection of Lord Londesborough, which has received an amount of enrichment of a very
varied character. The animals on one side, and in foliated scrolls, connect the design across
the summit of the implement with a totally new composition on the opposite side. We would not
insist on any part of the design as remarkable for high character; it is simply given as an
instance of the love of decoration so prevalent in the sixteenth century.

The highly-enriched knocker and door-handle (Fig. 36) were sketched from the original, on one
of the ancient houses of the quaint city of Nuremberg. The bell-pull beside it (Fig. 37) is
also from the same locality. There is probably no town in Germany where more artistic old iron-work
is to be seen than in this place,--once the richest of trading communities, when Albert Durer
flourished within its walls, and the Emperor Maximilian held royal state in its old castle.
To all who would realise the chivalric days of the old German Empire, we would say, “Go to
Nuremberg.”

The bellows of carved chestnut-wood (Fig. 39) is in the possession of the Count de Courval.
It is of simpler and “severer” design than common, inasmuch as it was usual to enrich these
useful domestic implements with an abundance of elaborate designs, and fill their centres with
scenes from sacred and profane history.

When ladies delighted in lace-working, and in starching and preparing their produce most carefully,
they showed their good housewifery in washing and ironing it with their own hands. It was gallantry
on the part of their spouses to make befitting presents of all things requisite for their labours,
and worthy their use. The box-iron we engrave in Fig. 39 is one which has thus been given;
it bears the monogram of the fair lady who originally owned it, engraved within a “true lover’s
knot.” The cupidons of the handle ending in flowers may be an emblem of Love and Hymen, forming
an appropriate embellishment.

CHAPTER III.

Applicability is the most useful characteristic of the style popularly known as the Renaissance;
it is confined to no one branch of art, but is capable of extension to all, from the most delicate
work of the jeweller to the boldest scroll-ornament adopted by the sculptor in wood or stone.
The Loggie of the Vatican is the best original example of the style as perfected by Raffaelle
and his scholars, and applied to wall-painting. It was a free rendering of the antique fresco
ornament then just discovered in the Baths of Petus, where extensive excavations were undertaken
in 1506, under the superintendence of the Papal authorities. The classic forms were “severer”
than those in use by the artists who resuscitated the style, and were somewhat overlaid with
ornament. The details of Raffaelle’s own work will not always bear adverse criticism, inasmuch
as there are heterogeneous features introduced occasionally, which are not visible in the purer
style of antiquity. As the fashion for this decoration travelled northward, it increased in
freedom from classic rule, and more completely deserved the term “grotesque,” which it occasionally
received, a term derived from grotte, an underground room of the ancient baths, and which we
now use chiefly in the sense of a ludicrous composition. Such compositions were not unfrequent
on the walls of Greek and Roman buildings; and the German and Flemish artists, with a nationally
characteristic love of whimsical design, occasionally ran riot in invention, having no rule
beyond individual caprice. This unfortunate position offering too great a licence to mere whimsicality,
was felt in ancient as well as in modern times. Pliny objected, on the grounds of false or
incongruous taste, to the arabesques of Pompeii, though they approached nearer to the Greek
model; and Vitruvius, with that purity of taste which was his grand characteristic, endorsed
the opinion, and enforced it in his teaching. We are often in error when we blindly admire,
or unhesitatingly adopt, the works of the ancients as perfection. In Athens and Rome in past
time, as in Paris and London at present, we may meet with instances of bad taste; for vulgarity
belongs to no age or station, and may be visible in the costly decoration of a rich mansion,
whose owner is uneducated in art, and insists on having only what he comprehends.

The decadence of the better-class Renaissance design was a natural consequence of the licence
its features might assume, and in the progress of the sixteenth century it became thoroughly
vitiated. The troubles which distracted Europe in the later part of that century, and which
led to the devastating wars and revolutions of the earlier part of the following one, completed
the debasement of art-workmanship. Louis XIV. had the glory, such as it was, of its resuscitation;
but his taste was merely that of an over-wealthy display, which not unfrequently lapses into
positive vulgarisms. The style known distinctively by the name of this monarch--with all its
heterogeneous elements, its scrolls of the most obtrusive form, fixed to ornament having no
proper cohesion, and overlaid with festoons of flowers and fruit--is more remarkable for the
oppressive ostentation which was the characteristic of the monarch and his age, than for good
taste or real elegance. What a very little exaggeration could make of this style may be seen
in the productions of the era of his successor, and which the Italians stigmatised by the term
rococo.

The examples of Renaissance given in our pages exhibit a fair average of its applicability.
The pendent ornament (Fig. 40) includes details adopted by jewellers. The shield, with the
sacred monogram (Fig. 41), is such as appeared in wood-panelling. The handle (Fig. 42) exhibits
as much freedom of design as the style could admit; it is quaint and peculiar, but not without
elegance in the mode of bringing the classic dolphin within the scope of the composition.

The distinctive features of the style may be more readily comprehended by contrasting it with
a few specimens of the so-called “Gothic style,” a style which possesses the strongest original
features, and one which will yield to none in peculiar beauty and applicability. We give two
examples--the one German, the other French; they are both wood panel, filled with tracery which
bears the distinctive characteristics of the two schools. The German (Fig. 43) is remarkable
for the sudden termination of its flowing lines, which occasionally gives to the carving of
the epoch an appearance of having been suddenly broken, or chopped off, in parts. At Nuremberg
this peculiarity is very observable; our specimen is selected from the church at Rottweil,
in the Black Forest, which bears the date of 1340. The French (Fig. 44) is a favourable example
of the Flamboyant style, which gave freedom to the mediæval rigidity of the Gothic, and paved
the way for the ready adoption of the style of Francis I., which was based on that of the Italians.

Figs. 45 and 47 display one peculiarity in this northern adaptation--the introduction of busts,
in high relief, in central medallions. It is sometimes introduced so unscrupulously in the
carved panelling of Elizabethan mansions, that it has almost the effect of a row of wooden
dolls peeping through shutters. The latter of the two examples may be received as one of the
best of its kind, exhibiting the utmost enrichment of which the style was generally capable,
and as few heterogeneous features, though here they are not entirely absent. By way of useful
contrast, we give in Fig. 48, a very pure specimen of a panel in Italian workmanship, from
a tomb of the sixteenth century, in the church of the Ara Cœli, at Rome. The flow of line here
is exceedingly graceful; the whole of the details are characterised by a delicacy unknown to
the artists of Germany and Flanders; the torches and volutes point unmistakably to the classic
origin of the whole.

It was not natural to the Roman people ever to forget their great art-works of antiquity; the
influence of the “departed spirits” still “ruled them from their urns,” as Byron truthfully
expresses it. The artists of Greece and Rome based their compositions on the unvarying truth
of nature; and though the barbaric mind might bear sway for awhile, it could not triumph but
through ignorance. Rome is now the great art-teacher only because it is the conservator of
its ancient relics; and they have had their influence undiminished from the days of Raffaelle
and Michael Angelo. There are many pleasing bits of design in the antique city, that show the
classic source of inspiration from which their inventors obtained them. The boy and dolphins,
forming the pleasing domestic fountain we engrave in Fig. 51, is an evident instance of the
influence of antique taste. The abundant supply of water was the grand feature of the Rome
of the Cæsars, as it still is of the Rome of the Popes; and the liberality with which every
house is served has frequently induced the owners of large mansions to decorate one corner
of their external walls with a fountain, at which all wayfarers may be supplied. In a recess
of the lowermost story of one of the great palazzi which line the principal street of Rome,
“the Corso,” our second specimen (Fig. 52) is placed. It represents a wine-merchant liberally
pouring from the bung-hole of his barrel its inexhaustible contents. On great festas in the
olden time it was not unusual to make public fountains run with wine for an hour or two, and
this may have occurred with the one engraved; it is a work of the latter part of the sixteenth
century, when luxury reigned in Rome. As a design it is exceedingly simple and appropriate,
reminding, by its quaintness, of German rather than Italian design. The old Teutonic cities
present very many striking inventions of the kind: and the promoters and designers of our drinking
fountains may obtain good and useful hints from that quarter.

Our street architecture has shown recently a greater freedom of design, and range of study,
than was ever exhibited before. We may owe this, in some degree, to the excellent works on
the domestic and palatial edifices of the Low Countries, which have issued from the press,
and have vindicated the true character of the great mediæval builders. Germany--taking the
term for the nation in its widest sense--can show in its antique cities a vast variety of fancy
in architecture and its ornamental details. Each city may be made a profitable residence for
the study of a young architect; and the superior knowledge of the leading principles of mediæval
art, now exhibited in their adaptation of the style to home events, is a clear proof that the
fact has been felt and acted on. The “infinite variety” of the old decorator is everywhere
apparent, and the play he gave to his invention. We give in Fig. 53, as one instance, the ornamental
mouldings of the Chapel of St. Nicholas, in the Cathedral of Aix; in this instance the rigidity
of the rule which enforces geometric form to the whole is softened by the introduction of the
cable moulding to a portion thereof, with singularly good effect. It is a work executed under
the rule of Armand de Hesse, Archbishop of Cologne, and Provost of Aix, probably about 1480.

The Gothic, therefore, of the best era, was by no means the stiff and monotonous style imagined
by those who only know its details by the remains of our own ecclesiastical buildings; not
that we infer them to be without much freedom and beauty occasionally, as in the Percy shrine
at Beverley Minster, or the tomb of Aylmer de Valence, in Westminster Abbey. But we have fewer
domestic buildings of a florid Gothic style than are to be found abroad, and the artists who
designed for that style delighted in new ideas. It is even visible in the works of their painters
and engravers: thus the tracery over the doorway in Durer’s print of “The Crucifixion,” one
of his series of the life of the Virgin, while it conforms to the leading principle of architectural
design, is composed of branches and leaves which flow with a freedom belonging more to the
painter than the architect. Similar instances abound in old pictures.

The foliation of German work was generally crisp and full of convolutions in its minor features,
though the leading lines were boldly conceived. We give an example from a panel carved in wood,
in the Cathedral of Stuttgard, a work of the middle of the fifteenth century. It is almost
a return to the old acanthus leaf, and so completes a cycle of fine art.

Brief as the review has necessarily been of the decorative arts adorning life throughout the
centuries which have passed in rapid succession before us, they have taught two great facts--the
beauty of art as an adjunct to the most ordinary demands of domesticity, and the value of the
study of the varied arts of past ages as an addition to the requirements of our own. “Ever
changing, ever new,” may be the lesson derived from the investigation of any epoch. How much
then may be obtained from a general review of all! Seroux d’Agincourt deduced a history of
art from its monuments;[41-*] and men of the present day have the advantage of all that the
world has produced brought easily, by aid of the burin and the printing-press, to their own
firesides. We are evidently less original in idea than our ancestors, from the association
of their labours with our thought; but we may yet live in the hope of seeing some new and peculiar
feature in the progress of modern decorative art obtained by retrospective glances at the past.

It is to the duty of thus learning from the past, we desire to direct the attention of our
readers. Slavishly to copy, or systematically to imitate, are evils scarcely less reprehensible
than to neglect them altogether; but frequent study of the great masters in any art is indispensable
to those who would excel. It is to the absence of such study that we may trace most of the
defects of the British artisan. Unhappily, he seldom either examines, reads, or thinks; generally
he is content to work, like a horse in a mill, pursuing the same monotonous round, producing
only that which has been produced before, without alteration, and without improvement. Until
within the last few years, this defect could hardly have been urged against him as an offence.
His employers did not require advancement, seldom encouraged intelligent workmen, and rather
preferred the mere machine who was content to do no more than his fathers had done, and who
looked upon new inventions as costly whims or expensive absurdities. There were exceptions--glorious
exceptions; but the rule was, undoubtedly, as we have stated.

This deplorable disadvantage exists no longer; in nearly every town in the kingdom, of any
size, there is some institution where knowledge may be obtained readily and cheaply. The societies
in connection with the Department of Science and Art now abound with competent masters and
teachers, and all the appliances of instruction.

The South Kensington Museum is alone a mine of wealth. Not only are the artisans enabled to
resort to it freely, but every possible inducement is held out to them to do so; the superintendents
there almost go into the highways to “compel them to come in.” There is no calling of any sort
or kind that may not be educated here; the masters, as well as the workmen, of all trades may
here receive the education, “free of charge,” which no sum of money could have procured for
them twenty years ago. Ignorance, nowadays, is, therefore, totally without excuse.

No doubt the seed that has been so extensively and abundantly planted is growing rapidly up;
in some places it has borne fruit. It is utterly impossible that the existing race of art-workmen,
and their successors “rising up,” can be ignorant as were their predecessors. If they use their
eyes merely, and permit their minds to remain blanks, they must improve. There is no street
in London now that will not teach them something; every shop window contains a lesson; and
it requires no very large observation to perceive advancement in every class of British art-manufacture--not,
certainly, so marked as to produce content, but exhibiting ample proof that we are progressing
in the right direction, and leading to the conclusion that at no very distant period we shall
not have to incur the reproach that our artisans are worse educated than those of Germany,
Belgium, and France. These remarks result from the brief insight we have given in these pages
into the rich volumes which the past has filled for the use of the present. The books to which
we have resorted, and the places in which we have sought for rarities, are open to most of
those who desire to examine them, and who will find an expenditure of time and labour to any
amount, be it large or small, produce an extent of remuneration of which the searcher will
have no idea until he begins to gather in the profit he has made.

We had intended to supply a list of books, to be obtained either at the British Museum or the
Museum at South Kensington, to which we desire to direct the attention of our art-producers
and art-workmen; but thus to occupy space is needless. The requisite information can be easily
procured: any of the superintendents, at either place, will gladly direct the searcher, on
receiving information as to his wants. Moreover, it is permitted, under certain restrictions,
to take sketches of engravings or drawings, and from objects exhibited; aids to do this readily
present themselves.

Books, however, should be regarded only as auxiliaries; they will supply in abundance material
for suggestion or adaptation; although, as we have already observed, “slavishly to copy, or
systematically to imitate,” are evils to be avoided.

GROTESQUE DESIGN, AS EXHIBITED IN ORNAMENTAL AND INDUSTRIAL ART.

Among the quaint terms in art to which definite meanings are attached, but which do not in
themselves convey any such definite construction, we may class the term grotesque. The term
grotesque was first applied as a generic appellation in the latter part of the fifteenth century,
when the “grottoes,” or baths of ancient Rome, and the lowermost apartments of houses then
exhumed, exhibited whimsically designed wall-decorations, which attracted the attention of
Raffaelle and other artists, who resuscitated and modified the style; adopting it for the famous
Loggie of the Vatican and for garden pavilions or grottoes.

We may safely go back to the earliest era in art for the origin of the style, if, indeed, the
grotesque does not so intimately connect itself with the primeval art of all countries as to
be almost inseparable. Indeed, it requires a considerable amount of classical education to
see seriously the meaning, that ancient artists desired in all gravity to express, in works
which now excite a smile by their inherent comicality. Hence the antiquary may be occasionally
ruffled by the remarks of some irreverent spectator, on a work which the former gravely contemplates,
because he feels the design of its maker, and is familiar with the antique mode of expression.
Thus the early Greek figures of Minerva, whether statues or upon coins, have occasionally an
irresistibly ludicrous expression: but, as art improved, this expression softened, and ultimately
disappeared, the grotesque element taking a more positive form and walk of its own.

In that cradle of art and science, the ancient land of Egypt, we shall find grotesque art flourishing
in various forms. Their artists did not scruple to decorate the walls of tombs with pictures
of real life, in which comic satire often peeps forth amid the gravest surroundings. Thus we
find representations of persons at a social gathering evidently the worse for wine-drinking;
or the solemn procession of the funeral boats interrupted by a ludicrous delineation of the
“fouling” or upsetting one unlucky boat and its crew, which had drifted in the way; while the
most impressive of all scenes, the final judgment of the soul before Osiris, is depicted at
Thebes with the grotesque termination of the forced return of a wicked soul to earth, under
the form of a pig, in a boat rowed by a couple of monkeys. In the British Museum is a singular
papyrus, upon which are drawn figures of animals performing the actions of mankind; and among
the large number of antiquities which swell the Egyptian galleries, there are many that exhibit
the partiality of this ancient people for the grotesque.

Our first examples consist of a group of wooden boxes and spoons, all of whimsical form, and
selected from the great work by Sir John Gardner Wilkinson on the manners and customs of the
ancient Egyptians.[49-*] They were formed to contain cosmetics of divers kinds, and served
to deck the dressing-table, or a lady’s boudoir. They are carved in various ways, and loaded
with ornamental devices in relief, sometimes representing the favourite lotus-flower, with
its buds and stalks, or a goose, gazelle, fox, or other animal. Fig. 55 is a small box, made
in the form of a goose; and Fig. 56, also in the shape of the same bird, dressed for the cook.
The spoon which succeeds this, Fig. 57, takes the form of the cartouche, or oval, in which
royal names were inscribed, and is held forth by a female figure of graceful proportions. Fig.
58 is a still more grotesque combination; a hand holds forth a shell, the arm being elongated
and attenuated according to the exigencies of the design, and terminating in the head of a
goose. The abundance of quaint fancy that may be lavished on so simple a thing as a spoon cannot
be better illustrated than it has been by an American author, who published, in New York, in
1845, an illustrated octavo volume on the history of “The Spoon: Primitive, Egyptian, Roman,
Mediæval, and Modern.” Speaking of these antique Egyptian specimens, he says,--“In these forms
we have the turns of thought of old artists; nay, casts of the very thoughts themselves. We
fancy we can almost see a Theban spoonmaker’s face brighten up as the image of a new pattern
crossed his mind; behold him sketch it on papyrus, and watch every movement of his chisel or
graver as he gradually embodied the thought, and published it in one of the forms portrayed
on these pages--securing an accession of customers and a corresponding reward in an increase
of profit. We take it for granted that piratical artisans were not permitted to pounce on every
popular invention which the wit of another brought forth. Had there been no checks to unprincipled
usurpers of other men’s productions, the energies of inventors would have been paralysed, and
the arts could hardly have attained the perfection they did among some of that famous people
of old.”

The graceful head and neck of the swan formed for many centuries the favourite termination
for the handles of simpula, or ladles. The Greeks and Romans adopted it, as they freely did
grotesque art in general; and the walls of Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibit it in untrammelled
style; while many articles of ornament and use were constructed in the most whimsical taste.
We must restrict ourselves to three specimens of Roman works, as many hundreds might be readily
brought together from public museums. Our group consists of two clasp-knives and a lamp. The
knife, Fig. 59, was found at Arles, in the south of France; the handle is of bone, and has
been rudely fashioned into the human form: the second example, Fig. 60, is of bronze, and represents
a canis venati, of the greyhound species, catching a hare; the design is perforated, so that
the steel blade shows through it. It was found within the bounds of the Roman station of Reculver,
in Kent; another of similar design was found at Hadstock, in Essex: nor are these solitary
examples of what appears to have been a popular design in Britain. The superiority of the British
hunting dogs has been celebrated by Roman writers, and induced their frequent exportation to
the capital of the world. The lamp, with the quaint head of an ivy-wreathed satyr, Fig. 61,
was found in the bed of the Thames, while removing the foundations of old London Bridge. The
protruding mouth of this very grotesque design holds forth the lighted wick. In nothing more
than in lamps did the quaint imaginings of the Roman artists take the wildest license.

When the successful incursions of northern barbarism had quenched the light of classic art,
the struggle made by such artists as the Goths had at command to embody the ideas of power
or grace they wished to indicate, were often as absurd as the work of a modern child. Hence
the grotesque is an inseparable ingredient in their designs, often quite accidental, and frequently
in express contradiction to the intention of the designer, who imagined in all seriousness
many scenes that now only excite a smile. A strong sense of the ludicrous was, however, felt
by mediæval men, and embodied in the art-works they have left for our contemplation. With it
was combined a relish for satire of a practical kind. A very good and amusing instance is given
in Fig. 62, which is copied from a carved corner-post of an old house in Lower Brook Street,
Ipswich. It depicts the old popular legend of the Fox and Geese, the latter attracted toward
Reynard by his apparent innocence and sanctity, as he reads a homily from a lectern, and meeting
the reward of their foolish trustfulness, in the fattest of their number being carried off
by the crafty fox. Both incidents are, as usual with these ancient designers, represented side
by side on different angles of the post.

Our next engraving, Fig. 63, is a very striking specimen of grotesque design in ironwork of
the fourteenth century. It is a door handle from a church in the High Street of Gloucester,
and a more extraordinary admixture of incongruous details could not very readily be imagined.
The ring hangs from the neck of a monster with a human head having ass’s ears, the neck is
snake-like, bat’s wings are upon the shoulders, the paws are those of a wolf. To the body is
conjoined a grotesque head with lolling tongue, the head wrapped in a close hood. Grotesque
design, for the reason already stated, frequently appears in the details of church architecture
and furniture during the Middle Ages, particularly from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century.
The capital of a column was the favourite place for the indulgence of the mason’s taste in
caricature; the misereres, or folding scats of the choir, for that of the wood-carver. It is
impossible to conceive anything more droll than many of the scenes depicted on these ancient
benches. Emblematic pictures of the months, secular games of all kinds, or illustrations of
popular legends, frequently appeared; but as frequently satirical and grotesque scenes, often
bordering on positive indelicacy; and occasionally satires on the clerical character, which
can be only understood when we remember the strength of the odium theologicum, and how completely
the well-established regular clergy disliked the wandering barefooted friars, who mixed with
the people free of all clerical pretence, and induced unpleasant comparison with the ostentatious
pride of the greater dignitaries. The Franciscans were in this way especially obnoxious, and
between them and the well-established Benedictines an incessant feud existed. The tone of feeling
that pervaded the middle and humbler classes found a mouth-piece in that curious satire, the
Vision of Piers Ploughman, than which Luther never spoke plainer.

One very prevailing form in early Gothic design was that of the mythic dragon, whose winged
body and convoluted tail were easily and happily adapted to mix with the foliage or other decorative
enrichments these artists chose to adopt. Hence we find no creature more common in early art
than this purely fanciful one, rendered still more fanciful by grotesque combination. The bosses
from which spring the vaulted ribs of Wells Cathedral furnish us with the instance engraved
in Fig. 64; here two dragons twine round a bunch of foliage, biting each other’s tails.

Domestic utensils were often made to represent living things; the tendency to convert a globular
vase or jug into a huge head or a fat figure, has been common to all people in all ages. The
highly civilised Greeks indulged the whim, and our own potters continue it. In the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, vessels for liquids were often constructed of bronze, taking the form
of lions, or mounted knights on horseback, of which specimens may be seen in our British Museum.
The manufacturers of earthenware imitated these at a cheaper rate, and we engrave (Fig. 65)
one example of their skill, the original being rudely coloured with a blue and yellow glaze
on the surface of the brown clay which forms the body.

The door-knocker (Fig. 66), whimsically constructed in form of a human leg, the heel hitting
against the door, is also a work of the fourteenth century; it is affixed to a house in the
Rue des Conseils, at Auxerre, and is very characteristic in execution.

Our selection (Fig. 67) comprises a most rare domestic antiquity, to which a date cannot so
readily be assigned, but which cannot be more modern than the sixteenth century, and may be
older. It is a toasting-fork in the form of a dog, to whose breast a ring is attached for holding
a plate. It is entirely constructed of wrought-iron, the body cut from a flat sheet of metal.
It was found in clearing away the foundations of one of the oldest houses in Westminster. The
tail of the dog forms a convenient handle; to the front foot a cross bar is appended to preserve
its due equilibrium.

Grotesque design was adopted by the artists who decorated books from the very earliest time.
The margins of ancient manuscripts are often enriched with whimsical compositions, as well
as with flowing designs of much grace and beauty. Occasionally the two styles are very happily
combined, and a humorous adjunct gives piquancy to a scholastic composition. The early printed
books often adopted a similar style in art, and we give two curious specimens. The letter F,
whimsically composed of two figures of minstrels (Fig. 68), one playing the trumpet and the
other the tabor, is copied from an alphabet, entirely composed in this manner, and now preserved
in the British Museum; it bears no date, but the late Mr. William Young Ottley, keeper of the
prints there, was of opinion that it was executed about the middle of the fifteenth century.
This quaint alphabet has been repeated by the artists of each succeeding generation, with variations
to adapt the letters to the costume or habit of each era; but in this unique series we seem
to see the origin of them all.

One of the most singular books ever issued from the press, was published about the same period;
it is known as the Ars Memorandi.[59-*] As its title imports, it was intended to assist the
memory in retaining the contents of the Gospels in the New Testament. This is done by making
the body of the design of the emblematic figure indicative of each, either the eagle, angel,
ox, or lion; in combination with this figure are many small groups, symbolic of the contents
of the various chapters. The copy we give (Fig. 69), from the second print devoted to St. Luke’s
Gospel, will make the plan of this singular picture-book clearer. The winged bull is spread
out as a base to the group of minor emblems, upon its head rests a funeral bier, and in front
of it a pot of ointment; the numeral 7 alludes to the chapter, the principal contents being
thus called to memory. The bier alludes to the Saviour’s miraculous restoration to life of
the widow’s son, whom He met carried out on a bier as He entered the city of Nain; the ointment
pot alludes to the anointing of His feet by Mary Magdalene. The bag upon which the figure 8
is placed, indicates the fable of the sower, it is the seed-bag of the husbandman; the boat
alludes to the passage of the Lake when the Saviour quelled the storm. The singular group of
emblems in the centre of the figure indicates--the power given to the disciples by the key;
the Saviour in his transfiguration, by the sun; and the miraculous multiplication of the five
loaves; as narrated in the 9th chapter of St. Luke. The following chapter has its chief contents
noted by the scroll indicative of the law; the sword which wounded the traveller from Jerusalem
whom the good Samaritan aided; and the figure of Mary commended by Jesus. No. 11 is typical
of the casting out a devil whose back is depicted broken: and No. 12, of the teaching of that
chapter in the Gospel; for here the heart is set upon a treasure-chest, an act we are especially
taught to avoid.

These great treasure-chests were important pieces of furniture in ancient houses, and were
generally placed at the foot of the master’s bed for the greater safety; in them were packed
the chief valuables he possessed, particularly the household plate. At a time when banking
was unknown, property was converted into plate, as a most convenient mode of retaining it.
Decorative plate increased the public state of its owner, was a portable thing, and could be
easily hidden in time of danger, or pledged in time of want. Hence the nobility and gentry
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries gave abundant employment to the goldsmith. Cellini,
in his Memoirs, has noted many fine pieces of ornamental plate he was called upon to design
and execute; and one of the finest still exists in the Kunst-Kammer, at Vienna--the golden
salt-cellar he made for Francis I., of France. The “salt” was an important piece of plate on
all tables at this period, and to be placed above or below it, indicated the rank, or honour,
done to any seated at the banquet. The large engraving (Fig. 70) delineates a very remarkable
salt-cellar, being part of the collection of antique plate formed by the late Lord Londesborough.
This curious example of the quaint designs of the old metal-workers, is considered to have
been the work of one of the famous Augsburg goldsmiths at the latter part of the sixteenth
century. It is a combination of metals, jewels, and rare shells in a singularly grotesque general
design. The salt was placed in the large shell of the then rare pecten of the South Seas, which
is edged with a silver-gilt rim chased in floriated ornament, and further enriched by garnets;
to it is affixed the half-length figure of a lady, whose bosom is formed of the larger orange-coloured
pecten, upon which a garnet is affixed to represent a brooch; a crystal forms the caul of the
head-dress, another is placed below the waist. The large shell is supported by the tail of
the whale on one side, and on the other by the serpent which twists around it; in this reptile’s
head a turquoise is set, the eyes are formed of garnet, and the tongue of red onyx. The whole
is of silver-gilt, and within the mouth is a small figure of Jonah, whose adventure is thus
strangely mixed with the general design. The sea is quaintly indicated by the circular base,
chased with figures of sea-monsters disporting in the waves. It would not be easy to select
a more characteristic specimen of antique table-plate. The inventories of similar articles
once possessed by the French king, Charles V., and his brother, the Duke of Anjou, King of
Naples and Provence (preserved in the Royal Library, Paris), give descriptive details of similar
quaint pieces of art-manufacture, in which the most grotesque and heterogeneous features are
combined, and the work enriched by precious stones and enamels. Jules Labarte observes, “the
artists of that period indulged in strange flights of fancy in designing plate for the table,
they especially delighted in grotesque subjects: a ewer or a cup may often be seen in the shape
of a man, animal, or flower, while a monstrous combination of several human figures serves
to form the design of a vase.”

But quaint and fanciful as were the works of the Parisian goldsmiths, they were outdone by
the grotesque designs of the German artificers. They invented drinking-cups of the strangest
form, the whole animal kingdom, fabulous and real, birds, and sea-monsters, were constructed
to hold liquids. A table laid out with an abundance of this strangely-designed plate, must
have had a ludicrous effect. Many of their works, though costly in character, refined in execution,
and thoroughly artistic in detail, are absolute caricatures. There is one in Lord Londesborough’s
collection, and another in that of Baron Rothschild, made in the form of a bagpipe; the bag
holds wine, and is supported on human feet; arms emerge from the sides and play on the chanter,
which is elongated from the nose of a grotesque face, the hair a mass of foliage. Dozens of
similar examples might be cited, of the most extraordinary invention, which the metal-workers
of the seventeenth century particularly gave their imaginations licence to construct. Indeed,
the German artists of that period seem to have had a spice of lunacy in their compositions,
and the works of Breughel were rivalled and outdone by many others whose fancies were of most
unearthly type. Salvator Rosa in Italy, and Callot in France, occasionally depicted what their
grotesque and mystic imaginings suggested, and Teniers gave the world witch-pictures; but for
the wild and wondrous, Germany has always carried the palm from the rest of the world in art
as in literature.

We engrave a fine example of a vase handle (Fig. 71), apparently the work of an Italian goldsmith
at the early part of the seventeenth century. The bold freedom of the design is utilised here
by the upheaved figure grasped by the monster, and which gives hold and strength to the handle;
the flowing character throughout the composition accords well with the general curve of the
vase to which it is affixed. There is a prevailing elegance in the Italian grotesque design
which is not seen in that of other nations. The knife handle by Francisco Salviati, which we
have also selected for engraving (Fig. 72), is a favourable example of this feeling; nothing
can be more outré than the figure of the monster which crowns the design; yet for the purpose
of utility, as a firm hold to the handle, it is unobjectionable; while the graceful convolutions
of the neck, and the flow of line in the figure, combined with this monster, give a certain
quaint grace to the design, which is further relieved by enriched foliage.

With one specimen of the later work of the silversmith, we take our leave of grotesque design
as applied to art-manufacture; but that work is as whimsical as any we have hitherto seen.
It is a pair of silver sugar-tongs (Fig. 73), evidently a work of the conclusion of the seventeenth
or beginning of the eighteenth century. It is composed of the figure of Harlequin, who upholds
two coiled serpents, forming handles; the body moves on a central pivot, fastened at the girdle,
and the right arm and left leg move with the front, as do the others with the back of the body,
which is formed by a double plate of silver, the junctures being ingeniously hidden by the
chequers of the dress.

We have already had occasion to allude to the adoption of grotesque design in book illustrations,
it is often seen in manuscripts, and abounds in early printed works. When wood engraving was
extensively applied to the enrichment of the books which issued in abundance from the presses
of Germany and France, the head and tail-pieces of chapters gave great scope to the fancies
of the artists of Frankfort and Lyons. The latter city became remarkable for the production
of elegantly illustrated volumes, which have never been surpassed. Our concluding cuts represent
one of these tail-pieces (Fig. 74), in which a fanciful mask combines with scroll-work; and
a head-piece (Fig. 75), (one half only being given), where the grotesque element pervades the
entire composition to an unusual extent, without an offensive feature. Yet it would not be
easy to bring together a greater variety of heterogeneous admixtures than it embraces. Fish,
beasts, insects, and foliage, combine with the human form to complete its ensemble. The least
natural of the group is the floriated fish, whose general form has evidently been based on
that of the dolphin. When Hogarth ridiculed the taste for virtu, which the fashionable people
of his own era carried to a childish extent, and displayed its follies in his picture of “Taste
in high life,” and in the furniture of his scenes of the “Marriage-à-la-mode,” he exhibited
a somewhat similar absurdity in porcelain ornament. In the second scene of the “Marriage” is
an amusing example of false combination, in which a fat Chinese is embowered in foliage, above
whom floats in air a brace of fish, which emerge from the leaves, and seem to be diving at
the lighted candles. Hogarth’s strong sense of the ludicrous was always pertinently displayed
in such good-humoured satire.

The pottery manufacturers were always clever at the construction of grotesques. We have noted
their past ability, and our readers may note their present talent in many London shops. The
French fabricants furnish us with the most remarkable modern works, and very many of the smaller
articles for the toilette, or for children’s use, are designed with a strong feeling for the
grotesque. Little figures of Chinese, rich in colour, twist about in quaint attitudes, to do
duty as tray-holders or match-boxes. Lizards make good paper-weights, and wide-mouthed frogs
are converted into small jugs with perfect ease. There is evidently a peculiar charm possessed
by the grotesque, which appeals to, and is gladly accepted by, our volatile neighbours. We
are ashamed to laugh at a child-like absurdity, and take it to our hearts with the thorough
delight which they do not scruple to display. In this we more resemble the Germans, and, like
them, we have a sombre element even in our amusements.

This subject, though entering so largely into the decorative designs of all countries and every
age, has never been treated with any attention as a branch of fine art. It is by no means intended
here to direct study to the reproduction of anything so false as the grotesque; but as it has
existed, and does still exist, its presence cannot be ignored, and will be recognised constantly
by all who study art.

FACTS ABOUT FINGER-RINGS.

FACTS ABOUT FINGER-RINGS.

CHAPTER I.

ANTIQUE RINGS.

Archæology, which was formerly considered by the majority of persons to be a dull and uninteresting
study, abounding with dry details of small general interest, which, when not pompously pretentious,
were, in the other extreme, of trifling insignificance, has, by a better acquaintance with
its true position as the handmaid of history, become so popular that most English counties
have societies especially devoted to its district claims, and our large cities have their archæological
institutes also. This is due to the good sense which has divested the study of its drier details,
or has had the tact to hide them beneath agreeable information. It is not too much to assert
that archæology in all its branches may be made pleasurable, abounding as it does in curious
and amusing details, sometimes humorously contrasting with our modern manners.

In taking up one of these branches--the history of finger-rings--we shall briefly show the
large amount of anecdote and curious collateral information it abounds in. Our illustrations
depict the great variety of design and ornamental detail embraced by so simple a thing as a
hoop for the finger. It would be easy to multiply the literary and the artistic branch of this
subject until a volume of no small bulk resulted from the labour. Volumes have been devoted
to the history of rings--Gorlæus among the older, and Edwards,[74-*] of New York, among the
modern authors. The ancients had their Dactyliotheca, or collection of rings; but they were
luxurious varieties of rings for wear. The modern collections are historic, illustrative of
past tastes and manners. Of these the best have been formed by the late Lord Londesborough
(whose collection was remarkable for its beauty and value), and Edmund Waterton, Esq., F.S.A.,
who still lives to possess the best chronological series of rings ever brought together. We
have had the advantage of the fullest access to each collection.

It is in the oldest of histories, the books of Moses, that we find the earliest records of
the use of the finger-ring. It originally appears to have been a signet, used as we now use
a written autograph; and it is not a little curious that the unchanged habit of Eastern life
renders the custom as common now as it was three thousand years ago. When Tamar desired some
certain token by which she should again recognise Judah, she made her first request for his
signet, and when the time of recognition arrived, it was duly and undoubtingly acknowledged
by all.[74-†] Fig. 76 exhibits the usual form assumed by these signets. It has a somewhat clumsy
movable handle, attached to a cross-bar passing through a cube, engraved on each of its facets
with symbolical devices. Sir John Gardner Wilkinson[75-*] speaks of it as one of the largest
and most valuable he has seen, containing twenty pounds’ worth of gold. “It consisted of a
massive ring, half an inch in its largest diameter, bearing an oblong plinth, on which the
devices were engraved, one inch long, six-tenths in its greatest and four-tenths in its smallest
breadth. On one face was the name of a king, the successor of Amunoph III., who lived about
B.C. 1400; on the other a lion, with the legend ‘lord of strength,’ referring to the monarch:
on one side a scorpion, and on the other a crocodile.” Judah’s signet was, of course, formed
of less valuable material, and had probably a single device only.

The lighter kind of hooped signet, as generally worn at a somewhat more recent era in Egypt,
is shown in Fig. 77. The gold loop passes through a small figure of the sacred beetle, the
flat under side being engraved with the device of a crab. It is cut in carnelian, and once
formed part of the collection of Egyptian antiquities gathered by our consul at Cairo--Henry
Salt, the friend of Burckhardt and Belzoni, who first employed the latter in Egyptian researches,
and to whom our national museum owes many of its chief Egyptian treasures.

From a passage in Jeremiah (xxii. 24) it appears to have been customary for the Jewish nation
to wear the signet-ring on the right hand. The biblical record treats them as contemporaneous
even at that early era. Thus the story of Judah and Tamar is immediately followed by that of
Joseph, when we are told “Pharaoh took off the ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s
hand,” when he invested him with authority as a ruler in Egypt. Dr. Abbott, of Cairo, obtained
a most curious and valuable ring, inscribed with a royal name. It is now preserved, with his
other Egyptian antiquities, at New York, and is thus described in his catalogue:--“This remarkable
piece of antiquity is in the highest state of preservation, and was found at Ghizeh, in a tomb
near that excavation of Colonel Vyse’s called ‘Campbell’s Tomb.’ It is of fine gold, and weighs
nearly three sovereigns. The style of the hieroglyphics is in perfect accordance with those
in the tombs about the Great Pyramid; and the hieroglyphics within the oval make the name of
that Pharaoh (Cheops) of whom the pyramid was the tomb.” Fig. 78 represents this ring, and
beside it (Fig. 79) is placed the hieroglyphic inscription upon the face of the ring, which
is cut with the most minute accuracy and beauty.

Rings of inferior metal, bearing royal names, were worn, probably, by officials of the king’s
household. Henry Salt had one such in his collection, which was afterwards in the remarkable
collection of rings formed by the late Lord Londesborough. It is represented in Fig. 80, and
is entirely of bronze. The name of Amunoph III. is engraved on the oval face of the ring, exactly
as it appears on the tablet of Abydus in the British Museum. Amunoph (who reigned, according
to Wilkinson, B.C. 1403-1367) is the same monarch known to the Greeks as Memnon; and the colossal
“head of Memnon,” placed in the British Museum through the agency of Mr. Salt, has a similar
group of hieroglyphics sculptured on its shoulder. There was another kind of official ring,
which we can recognise from the description of Pliny, and of which we give an engraving (Fig.
81) from the original in the author’s possession. It is of bronze, and has engraved upon its
face the figure of the scarabæus; such rings were worn by the Egyptian soldiers.

The lower classes, who could not afford rings of precious metals, but, like their modern descendants,
coveted the adornment, purchased those made of ivory or porcelain. In the latter material they
abounded, and are found in Egyptian sepulchres in large quantities; they are very neatly moulded,
and the devices on their faces, whether depicting gods, emblems, or hieroglyphics, are generally
well and clearly rendered.

This fondness for loading the fingers with an abundance of rings is well displayed on the crossed
hands of a figure of a woman (Fig. 82) upon a mummy case in the British Museum. Here the thumbs
as well as the fingers are encircled by them. The left hand is most loaded; upon the thumb
is a signet with hieroglyphics on its surface; three rings on the forefinger; two on the second,
one formed like a snail-shell; the same number on the next, and one on the little finger. The
right hand carries only a thumb-ring, and two upon the third finger. These hands are cut in
wood, and the fingers are partially broken.

Wilkinson observes--“The left was considered the hand peculiarly privileged to bear these ornaments;
and it is remarkable that its third finger was decorated with a greater number than any other,
and was considered by them, as by us, par excellence, the ring-finger; though there is no evidence
of its having been so honoured at the marriage ceremony.”

Herodotus narrates a curious antique legend he obtained in Egypt, concerning the ring of Polycrates.
It is remarkable as having spread into the legendary history of all countries, being still
credited by the commonality. We shall have hereafter to note its existence as an old London
tradition; but the version of the Greek historian is briefly thus:--Amasis, King of Egypt,
conceived an extraordinary friendship for the Greek, Polycrates, and, observing that the latter
was attended by unusual success in all his adventures, reflected that such unvarying felicity
seldom lasted through life, and the end of such a career was often calamitous. He therefore
advised him to propitiate future fortune by seeking some object whose loss would produce most
regret, and voluntarily casting it away from him where it could never be recovered. Polycrates
attached most value to a signet-ring he constantly wore; it was of gold, set with an emerald
cut by Theodorus of Samos, a famed engraver of gems. He went out in a galley far on to the
open sea, and then cast his precious ring into its waters, returning in an excess of grief.
Some six days afterwards a fisherman came to his gate, bearing a fish so fine and large he
deemed it to be only fitted for the table of Polycrates. The King of Samos accepted the gift,
the fish was sent to the royal kitchen, and on opening it a valuable ring was found in its
stomach. It was at once taken to Polycrates, who immediately recognised his abandoned treasure,
which he now valued the more as it seemed to be returned by divine interposition.

In the comparatively modern era of Roman rule in Egypt, rings of more fanciful construction
were occasionally worn. In the British Museum is a remarkable one (Fig. 83), having the convolutions
of a serpent, the head of Serapis at one extremity and of Isis at the other; by this arrangement
one or other of them would always be correctly posited; it has also the further advantage of
being flexible, owing to the great sweep of its curve.

The ancient Assyrians, though remarkable for that love of jewellery which has ever been the
characteristic of the Eastern nations, appear to have worn no finger-rings. Yet many of their
bracelets are admirably designed for the purpose if produced on a limited scale; and they were
worn by men as well as by women. Bonomi, in his “History of Nineveh and its Palaces,” observes,
“that not a single case occurs, amidst all this display of personal jewellery, of a finger-ring;
the entire absence of this ornament in sculpture, wherein details of this nature are so elaborately
and carefully attended to, leads to the conclusion that the finger-ring was an ornament then
unknown.”

Among the earliest traces of western civilisation the finger-ring appears. Fig. 84 is an Etruscan
ring of gold, now in the British Museum; upon the face are chimeræ opposing each other. The
style and treatment of this subject partake largely of the ancient character of Eastern art,
and, like that, is very decisive and conventional.

The Greeks and Romans literally revelled in rings of all styles and sizes. Nothing can be more
beautiful in design and exquisite in finish than Greek jewellery, and the custom of decorating
their dead with the most valued of these ornaments has furnished modern museums with an abundance
of fine specimens. Figs. 85 and 86 are copied from originals found in the more modern Etruscan
sepulchres, and are probably contemporary with the earliest days of the Roman empire. Fig.
85 is admirably adapted to the finger; being made of the purest gold, it is naturally slightly
elastic; but the hoop is not perfected, each extremity ending in a broad leaf-shaped ornament,
most delicately banded with threads of beaded and twisted wire, acting as a brace upon the
finger. Fig. 86 is equally meritorious; the solid half-ring is completed by a small golden
chain attached to it by a loop passing over studs; the links of this chain are perfectly flexible,
and of extreme delicacy; they resemble the modern guard-chain, or to speak more properly, the
modern chain imitates the ancient one; and we shall meet in the course of our researches with
very many other instances of the oft-repeated fact, that “there is nothing new under the sun.”

This ring mania was not content with considering the ring as an ornament, or even as a talisman;
a new science was revealed, the Dactyliomancia, so named from two Greek words, signifying ring
and divination. The performance of its mysteries was in itself so simple, that it was deemed
expedient to add certain formulæ, in order to make them more expressive. A ring was held, suspended
by a fine thread, over a round table, on the edge of which were placed counters engraved with
the letters of the alphabet. The thread was shaken until the ring, touching the letters, had
united as many as formed an answer to a question previously put. This operation was preceded
and accompanied by certain ceremonies. The ring was consecrated with divers mysterious forms.
The person who held it was arrayed in linen only; a circle was shaved round his head, and in
his hand he held a branch of vervain. Before commencing the gods were appeased by prayer.[82-*]
This practice long prevailed, and is mentioned by Gibbon as having given rise to the persecutions
for the crime of magic, in the reign of the Emperor Valens, at Antioch.[83-*]

The simplest and most useful form of ring, and that, by consequence, adopted by the people
of all early nations, was the plain elastic hoop, as shown in Fig. 87. Cheap in construction
and convenient in wear, it may be safely said to have been generally patronised from the most
ancient to the most modern times. Fig. 88 gives us the old form of a ring made in the shape
of a coiled serpent, equally ancient, equally far-spread in the old world, and which has had
a very large sale among ourselves revived as a “decided novelty.” In fact it has been the most
successful design our ring-makers have produced of late years. Yet this antique ring may add
another “new idea” to the modern designer. It is “made on the principle of some of our steel
rings which we use to hold household keys, widening their circle by pressure. In this finger-ring
the part in the mouth is inserted loose, so as to draw out and increase to the size of the
circle needed.”[83-†]

Though a great variety of form and detail was adopted by Greek and Roman goldsmiths for the
rings they so largely manufactured, the most general and lasting resembled Fig. 89, a Roman
ring, probably of the time of Hadrian, which is said to have been found in the Roman camp at
Silchester, Berkshire. The gold of the ring is massive at the face, making a strong setting
for the carnelian, which is engraved with the figure of a female bearing corn and fruit. By
far the greater majority of Roman rings exhumed at home and abroad are of this fashion, which
recommends itself by a dignified simplicity, telling, by quantity and quality of metal and
stone, its true value, without any obtrusive aid.

Sometimes a single ring was constructed to appear like a group of two or three upon the finger.
Mr. Edwards has furnished us with the example, Fig. 90. “It has the appearance of three rings
united, widened in the front and tapering within the hand. Upon the wide part of each are two
letters, the whole forming ZHCAIC, ‘Mayest thou live.’ The Romans often preferred the Greek
language in their most familiar customs.”

Among the beautiful objects of antique art collected by B. Hertz, Esq., and sold by auction
in 1859, by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, were many antique rings inscribed with sentences
and mottoes of a remarkable kind. Those bearing Greek inscriptions were the wordiest; such
as--“I love not lest I go astray; but I observe well, and I laugh.”--“They say what they will;
let them say, I care not.” Many were evidently memorials of friendship; one represented a hand
pulling the lobe of an ear, with the word “Remember;” another, with a similar device, with
the motto “Remind me of the noble character.” Others were inscribed--EYTYXI--“Good luck to
you,” and “I bring luck to him who wears this ring.” Among the Latin inscriptions were simple
good wishes expressed in the words “Vivas” and “Bene;” or sentiments expressed in few words,
such as--“Love me, I will love thee;” “Come, I will not;” “Be greeted, Fabiana.” Many were
simply inscribed with the names of the persons to whom they were presented, such as VLP. PRISCELLÆ
(“Ulpia Priscilla”); others with the names of the owners, as Valeria Cleopatra and Hermadion
Cæsaris. A massive silver ring inscribed with the name “Sabbina” is engraved (Fig. 91) from
the original in the Londesborough collection.

We place beside it a ring with a very different device, but one that cannot fail to be looked
on with singular interest. It is marked with the Labarum, the oldest sacred monogram of Christianity,
which Constantine believed he saw in a vision, and placed upon his victorious standard and
his coins, with the motto--“In hoc signo vinces!” This ring came from the Roman sepulchre of
an early Christian, and the hand for which it was originally fashioned may have aided in the
conquering war of the first Christian emperor; or may have been convulsed in an agonising death,
“thrown to the beasts” of the circus, but reposing after death with the first martyrs to the faith.

Clement of Alexandria suggests to the Christians of his era, that they should have engraved
devices of symbolic meaning allusive to their faith, in place of the heathen deities and other
subjects cut by Roman lapidaries; such as a dove, which symbolises life eternal and the Holy
Spirit; a palm-branch, peace; an anchor, hope; a ship in full sail, the church; and others
of similar import.

Gorius has preserved a representation of a gold ring (Fig. 93) which he believes to have been
presented by a Roman lady to the victorious charioteer in the horse-races; it is of peculiar
form, but one that was a favourite with Roman wearers. The bust of the donor appears on the
summit of the ring, and on each side are the heads of reined horses, as shown in our cut. Her
name is engraved on the lower part of the hoop, and on each side AMOROSPIS. The latter properly
being HOSPES, having the aspirate omitted and an I for an E, induces Gorius to consider it
a late work of the Roman era.

We have already spoken of the ring-hand and the ring-finger, but have not noted the origin
of the custom of placing the wedding ring on that finger. It resulted from an inaccurate belief
that a nerve went from thence to the heart. That the ancients were indiscriminate in the use
of their fingers as recipients for rings we have already shown; Mr. Waterton has placed in
his curious Dactyliotheca the forefinger from a bronze statue of late Roman workmanship, wearing
a large ring upon the second joint. In Germany it is still customary to wear the ring in this
fashion, a custom they evidently borrowed from their Roman subjugators, and have retained through
every century of change since then.

As the luxury of Rome increased, the wearing of rings increased also, and the emperors relaxed
the law of restraint. Thus Tiberias, in A.D. 22, gave permission for gold rings to be worn
by all persons whose fathers and grandfathers possessed property to the value of 200,000 sesterciæ.
The Emperors Severus and Aurelian ultimately gave the right of wearing gold rings to all soldiers
of the empire; and the Emperor Justinian at length gave a similar right to all who had legal
claims to Roman citizenship. Distinction once broken through, and wealth increasing, ring-wearing
became general. Seneca, describing the luxury and ostentation of his time, says, “We adorn
our fingers with rings, and a jewel is displayed on every joint.” The ridiculous excess to
which the custom was carried may be understood from Martial’s description of Charinus, who
wore as many as sixty rings on his hands at one time, and so fond was he of his jewellery that
he kept them upon his fingers when in bed. They were decorated with a vast variety of subjects,
originally cut in the metal of which the ring was made, whether gold, silver, or brass; ultimately
the devices were cut upon stones and gems, occasionally representing the tutelar deity of the
wearer. Thus Julius Cæsar wore one with Venus Victrix upon it, and his partisans did the same.
Pompey’s ring was engraved with three trophies, indicating his victories in Europe, Asia, and
Africa. Many used merely fanciful or emblematic devices; thus Mæcenas had a frog upon his ring.
Others wore the portraits of their ancestors or friends. Publius Lentulus had that of his grandfather.
Cornelius Scipio Africanus, younger son of the great Africanus, wore the portrait of his father;
but, as he was a degenerate son of an illustrious sire, the people gave expression to their
disgust at his conduct by depriving him of his ring, saying he was unworthy to wear the portrait
of so great a man.

This ring-wearing became one of the troubles of the wealthy, and as the Sybarite complained
of the folded rose-leaf inconveniencing his bed, the rich Roman was fatigued with his rings.
Hence came the custom of wearing light or heavy rings, or as they termed them, summer or winter
rings, according to the season. That there really was some reason in the complaint, will be
granted by the reader who looks on Fig. 95, copied from Montfaucon.[89-*] It is a thumb-ring
of unusual magnitude, and of costly material; it has upon it a bust in high relief of the Empress
Plotina, the consort of Trajan; she wears the imperial diadem, which is here composed of precious
stones cut into facets. This bust would of course come outside the hand, the narrower part
of the wreathed ring passing between the thumb and first finger. The gorgeous inconvenience
of the whole thing is at once apparent. It probably decorated the hand of some member of the
imperial family.

The enormous sums expended by the wealthy on rings may be best understood by an allusion to
the recorded value of two belonging to empresses of Rome. Thus, the ring of Faustina, we are
told, cost £40,000, and that of Domitia £60,000, reckoning the Roman sestertia at its modern value.

Sometimes the decoration of a ring was not confined to a single gem, though such rings were
comparatively rare. Valerian speaks of the annulus bigemmis, and Gorleus furnishes us with
the specimen engraved in Fig. 96; the larger gem has cut upon it a figure of Mars, holding
spear and helmet, but wearing only the chlamys; the smaller gem is incised with a dove and
myrtle branch. Beside it are placed two examples of the emblematic devices and inscriptions
adopted for classic rings, when used as memorial gifts. The first is inscribed, “You have a
love pledge;” the second, “Proteros (to) Ugiæ,” between conjoined hands--a type of concord
still familiar to us.

Though the ancients seem scarcely to have thought of decorating the circlet of the ring, they
occasionally varied its form, producing novelty at the expense of convenience. Fig. 98 is a
whimsical example; it may, however, have been principally used as a signet. The same may be
said of Fig. 99, which has a very broad face, set with an incised stone bearing a figure of Hygeia.

The ancients tell us of charmed rings; such was the ring of Gyges, which was reported to have
rendered him invisible when he turned the stone inwardly, and closed it in his palm. Execetus,
tyrant of the Phocians, carried two rings, which he was accustomed to strike together, to divine
by the sound emitted what he had to do, or what was to happen to him.

The most curious adaptation of the finger-ring to a double use was made by the Romans. It was
a combination of a ring and a key, as represented in Figs. 100 and 101, from originals engraved
by Montfaucon in his great work on Roman antiquities. He has published many varieties, for
they are very commonly discovered in all places where the Romans located themselves. Many have
been found in London, York, Lincoln, and other old cities, as well as in the neighbourhood
of Roman camps. The use of these rings is apparent: they opened the small cabinets or boxes
in which the most precious articles were preserved, and they were less likely to be lost, mislaid,
or improperly used by others, when thus worn night and day on the finger.

It is recorded of the poisoning Pope Alexander VI. (Borgia), that he caused a somewhat similar
key to be used in opening a cabinet; but the Pope’s key was poisoned in the handle, and provided
with a small sharp pin, which gave a slight puncture sufficient to allow the poison to pass
below the skin. When the Holy Father wished to rid himself of an objectionable friend, he would
request him to unlock his cabinet; as the lock turned rather stiffly, a little pressure was
necessary on the key-handle, sufficient to give the trifling wound that ultimately proved mortal.
Poisoned rings were known to the ancients; when Hannibal, the Carthaginian general, was overcome
by Scipio Africanus, it is recorded that he fled to Bithynia, and ended his life by poison,
which for that purpose he had reserved in a ring.

Rings formed of bone, amber, and glass, were provided for the poorer classes, as was the case
in ancient Egypt. They were also used as mortuary rings, and are found on the hands of the
dead in Italian sepulchres. The Waterton collection supplies us with two specimens. Fig. 102
is of amber, cut to appear as if set with a stone. Fig. 103 is of glass, also made as if set
with a jewel. The body of this ring is dark brown with bands of white crossing it; the jewel
is yellow.

In the later days of the Roman empire the simplicity and purity in decorative design that the
Romans obtained from the Greeks, gave way to the ostentatious love of gaudy decoration taught
at Byzantium. Jewellery became complicated in design; enrichment was considered before elegance.
The old simple form of finger-ring varied much. Fig. 104 is given by Montfaucon. Fig. 105 is
in the Londesborough collection, and was found upon the hand of a lady’s skeleton, buried with
her child in a sarcophagus discovered in 1846, in a field near Amiens, called “Le Camp de Cæsar;”
on two of her fingers were rings, one of which was set with ten round pearls, the other (here
engraved) is of gold, in which is set a red carnelian, engraved with a rude representation
of Jupiter riding on the goat Amalthea. The child also wore a ring with an engraved stone.
The whole of the decorations for the person found in this tomb proclaim themselves late Roman
work, probably of the time of Diocletian.

In 1841 a curious discovery was made at Lyons of the jewel case of a Roman lady, containing
a complete trousseau, including the rings here engraved. Fig. 106 is of gold; the hoop is slightly
ovular, and curves upward to a double leaf, supporting three cup-shaped settings, one still
retaining its stone, an African emerald. Fig. 107 is also remarkable for its general form,
and still more so for its inscription, VENERI ET TVTELE VOTVM, explained by M. Comarmond as
a dedication to Venus and the local Tutela, the guardian of the navigators of the Rhine; hence
he infers these jewels to have belonged to the wife of one of these rich traders in the reign
of Severus.

Carrying back our researches to the pre-historic era of our own island, and searching in the
tumuli of the early British chieftain and his family, we shall discover the utmost simplicity
of adornment; not probably the result of indifference to personal decoration, but simply to
the rudeness of his position. The wild Gaelic hunter, located in the gloomy fastnesses of wood
and morass, had little or no communication with the southern sea-margin of our isle: and when
we find the south Cymry of Britain much advanced in civilisation, owing to connection with
Belgic Gaul, and Phœnician colonists of Spain, and the Greek colonists of the Mediterranean,
we find the tribes inhabiting the midland and northern counties still barbaric, and little
advanced in the arts that make life pleasant. Such decoration as they adopted seems to have
originated in the basket-weaving, for which the British Islands were famous even at Rome, where
noble dames coveted these works from the far-off and mysterious Cassiteridæ. Plaited or interlaced-work,
resembling the convolutions of wicker and rush, was imitated in threads of metal; thus circlets
for the neck, bracelets for the arms, or rings for the fingers, were but twisted strands of gold.

The simplest form of finger-ring worn by these Gaelic ancestors consisted of a band of metal,
merely twisted round to embrace the finger, and open at either end. Fig. 108 shows one of these
rings, found in excavating at Harnham Hill, near Salisbury, a locality celebrated from the
very earliest recorded time as the true centre of ancient Britain. This ring was found on the
middle finger of the right hand of a person of advanced age. Sometimes several rings were found
on one hand. “Among the bones of the fingers of the left hand of an adult skeleton was found
a silver ring of solid form, another of spiral form, and a plain gold ring.”[96-*] Mr. Akerman,
who superintended these researches, says, “Similar rings have been found at Little Wilbraham,
at Linton Heath, at Fairford, and other localities. They are for the most part of an uniform
construction, being so contrived that they could be expanded or contracted, and adapted to
the size of the finger of the wearer.”[96-†]

The prevailing form of the old Celtic finger-ring is shown in Fig. 109. It is formed of thick
twisted wires of pure gold. This fashion seems to have been in most favour with all the early
Celtic tribes, such rings being found in the grave-mounds of Gaul, Germany, Belgium, Denmark,
Ireland, and Scotland. A discovery of many similar rings was made in one of the Western Islands
of Scotland; they were formed of from three to eight wires each, elaborately and beautifully
enwreathed.

The south Saxons retained to the last the simple form of wire-ring, which originated, as we
have already shown, with the most ancient people. Its comparative cheapness and ease of construction
were no doubt its great recommendations. Similar rings are still made for the poorer classes
in the East: the author has seen such worn in modern Egypt. Specimens have been obtained in
Anglo-Saxon grave-mounds in England, and others, identical in form, in the old Saxon cemeteries
of Germany.[97-*] Fig. 110 represents one of the plainest of these wire-rings; it was exhumed
from a tumulus on Chartham Downs, a few miles from Canterbury, Kent, in 1773, by the Rev. Bryan
Faussett, who says, “the bones were those of a very young person.” Upon the neck was a cross
of silver, a few coloured earthen beads, and “two silver rings with sliding knots.”

The industry of the same collector furnishes us with Fig. 111, a specimen of a wire-ring so
twisted as to resemble a seal ring, or one set with a stone: the wire round the finger has
been beaten out flat. It was discovered in the extensive Saxon cemetery on Kingston Downs,
near Canterbury, on the Dover Road. The tumulus was evidently the last resting-place of a person
of small wealth, as this copper ring and two small beads only were found in it; and it was
customary to bury the ornaments of the deceased, however valuable, with them.[98-*]

Ireland seems to have boasted a higher civilisation at an earlier period than the sister kingdoms,
and her ancient art-works are remarkable for their skilled and tasteful elaboration. Gold,
too, appears to have been used more commonly there, and the museum of the Royal Irish Academy
can show a more wonderful collection of personal ornaments in that precious metal, as once
worn by the native nobles, than is to be seen in the national museums of any other country,
with the exception of Denmark. The gold is of the purest kind and richest colour, and the manner
of its working could not be excelled by a modern goldsmith. The Londesborough collection includes
two remarkable rings (Figs. 112 and 113), which were found with other gold ornaments near the
very remarkable tumulus known as “New Grange,” a few miles from Drogheda. They were accidentally
discovered in 1842 by a labouring man, within a few yards of the entrance to the tumulus, at
the depth of two feet from the surface of the ground, and without any covering or protection
from the earth about them. Two bracelets of thick twisted gold, and a chain, also of gold,
were found with them. Another labouring man, hearing of this discovery, carefully searched
the spot whence they were taken, and found a denarius of Geta, which may aid us in arriving
at some conclusion as to the age of these curious works. The stone set in both rings is a cut
agate.

MEDIÆVAL RINGS.

The rings worn by the higher class of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors during the Heptarchy were often
very beautiful, and of imposing form. One of the finest we have seen belonged to the Rev. H.
B. Hutchings, of Appleshaw, Hants,[100-*] and was found in a meadow at Bosington, near Stockbridge,
in the same county, by a labourer who saw it among a heap of peat. We give a side and front
view of this interesting relic; the whole is of gold, and is of considerable weight and thickness;
the gold threads are all beautifully reeded, and the lettering and head executed with great
care. The inscription reads--NOMEN EHLLA FID IN XPO, equivalent to its owner saying, “My name
is Ella, my faith is in Christ.”

The beautiful and remarkable collection of rings formed by Edmund Waterton, Esq., F.S.A., to
which allusion has already been made, includes a ring of South Saxon workmanship, which was
found in the Thames at Chelsea in 1856. The face of this ring (Fig. 116) is an elongated oval,
with a circular centre. Within this circle is the conventional figure of a dragon, surrounded
by convoluted ornament, reminding us forcibly of the prevailing enrichments so lavishly bestowed
on old Runic monuments, at home and abroad. Four quaintly-formed heads of dragons occupy the
triangular spaces, above and below this centre. This ring is of silver. The ground between
the ornament has been cut down, probably for the insertion of niello or enamel colours.

Fig. 117 is an historic relic of singular interest, and a remarkable work of early art. It
is the ring of Ethelwulf, King of Wessex (the father of Alfred the Great), who reigned A.D.
836-838, and bears the royal name upon it. It was found in the parish of Laverstock, Hants,
in a cart-rut, where it had become much crushed and defaced. The form is remarkable, the front
rising pyramidally. Two birds of conventional form face each other, a flower ornament dividing
them; these decorations, like those on Mr. Waterton’s ring just described, are relieved by
a ground of glossy bluish-black enamel, cavities having been cut between the ornament for its
infusion. This ring is of gold, weighing 11 dwts. 14 grs.; it is now preserved in the British
Museum.

Mr. Waterton is the fortunate possessor of a ring second only in interest and value to this
royal relic. It is the ring of Ahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, the friend and counsellor of King
Ethelwulf, who flourished A.D. 817-867. It was discovered in Carnarvonshire, and has the name
of the bishop in divided letters distributed on the circular rosettes of the design; they are
connected by lozenge-shaped floriated ornaments, having dragons in their centres. Our cut (Fig.
118) gives the general form and detail of this beautiful ring, which is remarkable for the
elegance of its design. It is of gold, like the preceding ring; both being admirable illustrations
of the champ-levé process of enamelling as practised in the ninth century.

A remarkable discovery of coins and treasure was made in 1840 by workmen employed in digging
at Cuerdale, near Preston, in Lancashire. It consisted of a large mass of silver, in the form
of ingots or bars of various sizes, a few armlets and rings, and portions of other ornaments,
cut into pieces as if for remelting. With them were packed nearly seven thousand coins of various
descriptions, consisting of Anglo-Saxon pennies, others struck by the second race of French
kings, a few Oriental coins, and others which appear to have been coined by some of the piratical
northern chieftains. This treasure was minutely examined by E. Hawkins, F.R.S., of the British
Museum, and he came to the conclusion that it had been deposited about the year 910, and that
the ornaments must be considered such as were worn about the time of Alfred, or perhaps somewhat
earlier. The rings retain much of the primitive British form, as will be seen on examining
the two selected for engraving here. Fig. 119 is beaten out into a broad face, which is covered
with an indented ornament produced by a chisel-shaped punch of triangular form, the points
of two conjoined in one pattern, the edge of the ring on each side further enriched by a series
of dots. Fig. 120 has a still broader face, which is decorated by groups of three circles each,
somewhat irregularly distributed over the surface, with indented lines between them. The open
end of this ring has been drawn together and secured by a coil of wire. Such rings were probably
worn by the middle classes.

The passion for gems and jewellery was excessive among all the Gothic nations. When Alaric
pillaged Rome, his booty in this way was enormous; and it is recorded that his princess, Placidia,
received as a present from the conqueror’s brother, fifty basins filled with precious stones
of inestimable value. Not only were the persons of these sovereigns and nobles covered with
gems, inserted in girdles, sword-scabbards, on borders of garments or shoes; but vases, dishes,
bowls, drinking-cups, as well as portable articles of furniture, caskets, &c., were similarly
enriched. The Ostrogoth and Wisigoth kings amassed, in Tolosa and Narbonne, immense treasures
in gems and gold and silver vessels. When Narbonne was pillaged, the number of ornaments of
pure gold enriched with gems that fell to the conquerors would scarcely be credited, were the
details recorded by less trustworthy authors, or not corroborated by some few works of the
same age which have fortunately descended to us.

The Church shared largely in this wealth; crosses, reliquaries, and sacred vessels of all kinds,
were made of the most costly material, and encrusted with gems. One of these ancient works
may still be seen in Cologne Cathedral--the chasse, or reliquary, containing the reputed skulls
of the three Magi, of whom we shall soon have to speak more fully. This remarkable work is
studded all over with engraved intaglios of Roman workmanship. Churchmen at this time were
clever artificers; and St. Dunstan, great statesman as he was, in the British, and St. Eloi
in the Gallic, church, both skilled working goldsmiths, have since become the patron saints
of confraternities of their followers.

The higher clergy on all solemn occasions displayed much personal decoration. A jewelled ring
was part of the adornment of a bishop when arrayed in full pontificals. It indicated his rank,
was made for him, and buried with him. The treasuries of our old cathedrals still possess a
few of these rings. One of the earliest and most curious is kept by the Dean of Winchester,
and is represented in Fig. 121. It was found during the repair of the choir under the tomb
of William Rufus, and is supposed to have been the pontifical ring of Henry de Blois, Cardinal,
and Bishop of Winchester, A.D. 1129. It is a massive ring of solid gold, set with an oval irregularly-shaped
sapphire, en cabochon, polished only, not cut; held in its heavy socket by four fleur-de-lys,
and still further secured by drilling through its centre a passage for a gold wire--a reckless
way of treating valuable jewels, which is characteristic of almost all these early works.

Fig. 122 is an ordinary pontifical gold ring of investiture, used in the Anglican Church about
this time. It was found at Winchester, and is preserved with Fig. 121, described above. It
has a very massive setting for a large blue sapphire, and is very characteristic, though simple
in its design.

Dignity, as exhibited by weight and simplicity, seems to have been chiefly regarded in the
design of these old episcopal insignia. In the sacristy at York Minster is preserved a very
excellent specimen, Fig. 123. This was found in the tomb of Archbishop Sewall, who died in
1256. With it is kept another fine ring of more elaborate design (Fig. 124), which was discovered
in the tomb of Archbishop Greenfield, who died in 1315. The foliations which curl around the
central stone and its setting, take the prevailing forms adopted in architectural enrichments
of the archbishop’s age. The stones usually chosen for such rings were ruby, emerald, or crystal,
and had a significance usual with all things connected with the Roman Catholic Church; ruby
indicated its glory, emerald its tranquillity and happiness, and crystal its simplicity and
purity. The diamond typified invulnerable faith; the sapphire, hope; the onyx, sincerity; the
amethyst, humility.

In the old romance of “Sir Degrevant,” we are told that at the marriage of the hero there came

    “Archbishops with rings
    More than fifteen.”

In the romance of “King Athelstan” (also a work of the fourteenth century), the king exclaims
to an offending archbishop--

    “Lay doun thy cross, and thy staff,
    Thy miter, and thy ring, that I to thee gaff:
      Out of my land thou flee.”

The episcopal ring, being thus necessarily a mark of rank, was worn about this time over the
gloves: sometimes as a thumb-ring, and often of very large size. The ornaments of the clergy
became more massive as the wealth of the Church increased. As the clergy were during church
service separated from the laity, many of the latter were at a considerable distance from them.
This may be a reason for the size adopted for episcopal rings. A late Dean of St. Patrick’s
had in his collection a very large ring of this kind, represented in Fig. 125, from a sketch
made by the author when it was in the possession of W. Huxtable, F.S.A., in 1847. It was of
bronze, thickly gilt, and set with a crystal.

This peculiar form was generally adopted for rings at this period. The Londesborough collection
furnishes us with a curious specimen (Fig. 126), formed of gilt copper, and set with a small
ruby, which must have stood forth from the finger in what would now be considered as a most
inconvenient manner. Fig. 127 exhibits the form of the plain hooped ring, simply decorated
with quatrefoils on each side of the stone (in this instance a small irregularly-shaped sapphire),
which is embedded in a somewhat solid setting projecting from the ring.

In the Gentleman’s Magazine for 1848 is engraved a massive ring, also of brass, thickly gilt,
the hoop chased with the arms of Pope Pius II.[108-*] (the famed Æneas Sylvius), and his name,
Papa Pio, between the tiara and the cross-keys. On each of the four sides of this ring appears
one of the four beasts of the Revelation, typifying the Evangelists: they are executed in high
relief. It is set with a large topaz. This ring has since passed into Mr. Waterton’s fine collection,
who is the fortunate possessor of others of the same class. One in the Londesborough collection
is here engraved, Fig. 128, as a good specimen of the general design adopted for such rings.
The crossed-keys surmount a coat of arms on one side of the ring; the keys alone appear on
the opposite side; foliated ornament fills the space above the circlet on either side. This
ring is set with a large crystal.

We close our series of episcopal rings with one found in the cathedral at Hereford during the
repairs of the choir in 1843, which rendered the removal of the beautifully carved alabaster
monument of Bishop Stanbery unavoidable. This bishop held the See from 1452 until his death
in May, 1474. Upon opening the tomb a few fragments of bone were discovered, very small portions
of the mere remains of the silk of the robes in which the body of the bishop was enveloped,
and this beautiful ring, of which views are given in Figs. 129 and 130. It is of gold, set
with a sapphire; the sides of the ring are decorated with sprays and flowers on a ground of
dark enamel; and inside is the motto “=en bon an=.”

A very large ring, bearing great general resemblance to the episcopal ring, was occasionally
worn as a thumb-ring by the laity. A specimen of such a one is selected from the Londesborough
collection in Fig. 131. It is somewhat roughly formed of mixed metal, and has upon the circular
face a conventional representation of a monkey looking at himself in a hand-mirror. This is
surrounded by a cable moulding, and on each side is set two large stones. The outer edge of
this ring is also decorated with a heavy cable moulding: inside, next the finger, is the cross
and sacred monogram, placed on each side of the mystic word anamzapta, which we shall immediately
have to explain more fully when speaking of the rings commonly worn as charms.

These massive thumb-rings were indicative of wealth or importance, when worn by the middle
classes who had obtained any municipal position. When Falstaff speaks of his slenderness in
his youth, he declares that he could then have “crept through an alderman’s thumb-ring.” Like
the massive gold chains still worn by that honourable fraternity, they told of a trader’s wealth.
The inventories of personal property belonging to burgesses in the Middle Ages, contain frequent
allusions to such rings, without which they would have felt shorn of an important part of their
head-earned honours. Among the wills and inventories preserved at Bury St. Edmund’s, published
by the Camden Society, is one made by Edward Lee, of that town, bearing date 1535, in which
he bequeaths to a friend, “my double wreathed ryng of gold, whych I ware on my thumbe.” From
this description it is evident that this ring must have borne great resemblance to that given
in Fig. 131, with its outer cable or double wreathed pattern. There is a brass in Hastings
Church, Sussex, with the effigy of a gowned citizen wearing such a ring. That such rings became
in the end indicative of that class, and were retained in fashion for this reason when they
had been long discarded from general use, may be safely inferred from the description of a
character introduced in the Lord Mayor’s Show in the year 1664, who is said to be “habited
like a grave citizen--gold girdle and gloves hung thereon, rings on his fingers, and a seal
ring on his thumb.” Such rings were evidently used according to the most ancient mode as personal
signets, by such as were not entitled to bear arms; hence originated the quaint inventions
known as “merchant’s marks,” which were impressed on merchandise, painted on shields instead
of armorial bearings, inserted in memorial windows of stained glass, and worn on the thumb
for constant use in sealing. A very fine ring of this kind is engraved in the Journal of the
Archæological Institute, vol. iii., and is here copied in Fig. 132. It was found in the bed
of the Severn, near Upton, and is probably a work of the fifteenth century; it is of silver,
and has been strongly gilt. The hoop is spirally grooved, and upon the circular face is a large
letter H, surrounded by branches.

The custom of placing initial letters on rings is a very old one, and they are sometimes surmounted
by crowns or coronets; hence they have frequently been mistakenly appropriated to royalty.
Fig. 133 is a ring of this kind, with a crowned I upon it; hence it was once called “King John’s
ring.” It is most probably the initial of the Saviour’s name as King of the Jews, in the same
way that the crowned M may indicate the Virgin Mary as “Queen of Heaven,” a favourite popish
designation. Such rings may have been worn from religious feeling, or from the superstitious
belief in the efficacy of holy names as preservatives from evil. The baseness of the metal
of which they are often made, and their consequent small value, precludes the possibility of
their having belonged to royalty. The same remark will apply to a ring also engraved in the
Journal of the Archæological Institute, and now in the possession of the Rev. Walter Sneyd.
It is there described as of mixed yellow metal gilt; on either side of the hoop there is a
crown (Fig. 134), of the form commonly seen on coins of the twelfth century, and on the signet
are the words, ROGERIVS REX, chased in high relief. In the form of the character they correspond
closely with legends upon coins of Roger, second Duke of Apulia, of that name, crowned King
of Sicily A.D. 1129; he died A.D. 1152. This ring has every appearance of genuine character,
but it is difficult to explain for what purpose it was fabricated, the inscription not being
inverted, and the letters in relief ill suited for producing an impression. It seems very improbable
that King Roger should have worn a ring of base metal; and the conjecture may deserve consideration,
that it was a signet not intended for the purpose of sealing, but entrusted in lieu of credentials
to some envoy. The popular literature of the Middle Ages abundantly proves this custom to have
been in general use. The tale of Ipomydon, in Weber’s “Ancient Metrical Romances,” notes the
gift of a ring to the hero from his mother, which is to be used as a token of recognition to
his illegitimate brother, and which is brought secretly to his notice by being dropped into
his drinking horn. In the “Romance of Florence and Blancheflor,” a ring serves the purpose
of letters of introduction when the hero is on his travels, and ensures him hospitality when
he deserves it.

Rings sometimes bore the name and title of the Saviour in full, as in Fig. 135 from the Londesborough
collection. Two hands are clasped in front; it was, therefore, most probably a gift, or betrothal
ring. It is silver, somewhat rudely fashioned. The inscription (here engraved below it) is
in uncial characters, and shorn of its somewhat awkward abbreviation, reads “Jesus Nazareneus Rex.”

The same collection furnishes us with the specimen of a religious ring (Fig. 136), apparently
a work of the fourteenth century. It has a heart in the centre, from which springs a double
flower. On the upper edge of the ring are five protuberances on each side; they were used to
mark a certain number of prayers said by the wearer, who turned his ring as he said them, and
so completed the series in the darkness of the night. Such rings are of very common occurrence,
and must have been in general use. They are sometimes furnished with more prominent knobs,
as in Fig. 137. They are termed decade rings when furnished with ten bosses, which were used
to count the repetition of ten aves, but they are occasionally seen with one or two additional
bosses; when there are eleven, they notify ten aves and a paternoster; the addition of the
twelfth marks the repetition of a creed.

Allusion has already been made to the mystic virtues attributed to stones during the Middle
Ages, and for the fondness for collecting antique gems. They were coveted not only as works
of art, but for their supposed power over the circumstances of life, or the welfare of individual
wearers. The idea very probably originated with the Gnostics of the East, who engraved stones
with mystic figures believed to impart good luck or to keep off evil influences. So completely
had this belief gained hold on all classes, that a Gnostic gem set as a ring was found on the
finger of the skeleton of an ecclesiastic, in the Cathedral of Chichester, “affording indubitable
evidence that these relics were cherished in the Middle Ages by those whose express duty it
was to reprove and check such gross superstition.”[115-*]

This belief was ultimately reduced to a system. An old French Lapidaire, compiled in the thirteenth
century, assures us that a stone engraved with the figure of Pegasus or Bellerophon is good
for warriors, “giving them boldness and swiftness in flight,” very contradictory qualifications,
it must be allowed. One with the figure of Andromeda had the power of conciliating love between
man and woman. “A gem bearing the figure of Hercules slaying a lion or other monster, was a
singular defence to combatants. The figure of Mercury on a gem rendered the possessor wise
and persuasive. The figure of Jupiter with the body of a man and the head of a ram, made the
man who bore it beloved by everybody, and he was sure to obtain anything he asked. If you find
a stone bearing the figure of a hare, it will be a defence against the devil; if you find a
dog and a lion on the same stone, it will be a preservative against dropsy or pestilence. The
figure of Orion was believed to give victory in war. If you find a stone, in which is Perseus
holding in his right hand a sword, and in his left the Gorgon’s head, it is a preservative
against lightning and tempest and against the assaults of devils. A stone on which is engraved
a long-bearded man sitting on a plough, with a bending in his neck, and four men lying down,
and holding in his hand a fox and a vulture, this, suspended about the neck, enables you to
find treasures. If you find a dove, with a branch of olive in its mouth, engraved in pyrites,
and mount it in a silver ring, and carry it with you, everybody will invite you to be his guest,
and people will feast you much and frequently. The figure of a syren, sculptured in a jacinth,
rendered the bearer invisible. A fair head, well combed, with a handsome face, engraved on
a gem, gave to the bearer joy, reverence, and honour. Such were the qualities attached to ancient
gems in the Middle Ages.”[116-*]

Many plain stones were also believed to have magical virtues. Thus, the amethyst prevented
drunkenness, and was consequently often set upon wine cups. The crystal clouded if evil was
about to happen to its wearer. Amber was good against poison, hence drinking-cups were formed
from it. The topaz cured and prevented lunacy, increased riches, assuaged anger and sorrow,
and averted sudden death. Such was the faith placed in stones until the end of the sixteenth
century. Dr. Donne speaks of

    “A compassionate turquoise, that doth tell,
    By looking pale, the wearer is not well.”

But the most curious of all these superstitious beliefs attached itself to the crapaudine,
or toad-stone. It is most unattractive to sight, of an opaque dirty-brown tint, and known to
mineralogists as a variety of trap-rock. It was believed to have most sovereign virtues against
poison if pounded and drank, and, like the turquoise, to give warning of its presence by a
change of colour, when simply worn in a ring. It was believed to exist in the head of the toad.
It is to be done thus:--“Put a great or overgrown toad (first bruised in divers places) into
an earthen pot; put the same into an ants’ hillocke, and cover the same with earth, which toad
at length the ants will eat, so that the bones of the toad and stone will be left in the pot.”
Boethius relates how he watched a whole night an old toad he had laid on a red cloth to see
him cast forth the stone, but the tedious watch was not rewarded; the toad retained his jewel,
and he had nothing from thence to “gratify the great pangs of his whole night’s restlessness.”

The Londesborough collection supplies us with two remarkable specimens of rings connected with
toad superstition. Fig. 138 is of mixed metal gilt, having upon it the figure of a toad swallowing
a serpent. There is a mediæval story of a necromancer introducing himself to another professor
of magic by showing him a serpent ring, upon which the latter, who did not desire any one to
interfere with his practice, produced his toad-stone ring, observing that the toad might swallow
the serpent, thereby intimating his power to overcome him. Fig. 139 is curious, not only as
containing the true toad-stone, but also that the stone is embossed with the figure of a toad,
according to the description of Albertus Magnus, who describes the most valuable variety of
this coveted gem as having “the figure of the reptile imprinted upon it.”

The elder poets have, as usual with them, turned into a moralisation this fabulous bit of natural
history. In the Londesborough collection is the massive thumb-ring delineated in Fig. 140,
having the tooth of some animal as its principal gem, fondly believed by its original owner
to have mystic power over his well-being. To “make assurance doubly sure,” it is set all round
with precious stones, all believed to have magical virtues.

Superstition was not confined to the real world of animal life, but ranged over the fabulous
natural history which mixed largely with the true, in all men’s minds, at this credulous era
of the world’s history, when persons put more faith in false charms for the cure of disease
or the prevention of evil, than in the power of medicine, or the value of proper preventives.
The horn of the unicorn, the claw of the griffin, and other relics of equal verity and value,
were sought eagerly by those rich enough to procure them, and when obtained were believed to
ensure much good fortune to the possessor. A fear of the “evil eye”--that bugbear which still
disturbs the happiness of the lower class Italians and of the Eastern nations generally--was
carefully provided against. One great preservative was the wearing of a ring with the figure
of a cockatrice upon it. This imaginary creature was supposed to be produced from that rarest
of all rare things, a cock’s egg, foolishly believed to be laid on certain occasions under
magic influence and planetary agencies. Sir Thomas Browne, in his “Vulgar Errors,” describes
this imaginary creature “with legs, wings, a serpentine and winding tail, and a crest or comb
somewhat like a cock.” The Londesborough collection supplies us with a thumb-ring (Fig. 141),
having two cockatrices cut in high relief upon an agate. The eye of the living cockatrice was
believed to be so deadly as to kill by a look, to which Shakspere alludes in Twelfth Night,
and again in Romeo and Juliet:--

                    “Say thou but I,
    And that base vowel I shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.”

There was, however, a counteraction to the danger, for it was also believed that if a person
saw the creature before it saw him, then the cockatrice died from the effect of the human eye.
To this Dryden alludes:--

    “Mischiefs are like a cockatrice’s eye,
    If they see first they kill, if seen they die.”

The figure of this bird merely gave security against the evil eye; it had no other effect;
and for this purpose various engraved stones were used. Thus, Fig. 142, from the same collection,
has set in its centre a Gnostic gem with cabalistic figures, believed able to avert the dreadful
glance.

Such stones were, of course, “far sought, dear bought;” and rings believed to possess such
covetable power had a high money value. How then were the poor, still more ignorant and superstitious,
to be aided? Craft came to the aid of faith: demand, as usual, produced supply, and inscriptions
took the place of costly jewels. Rings were fabricated in silver and baser metals, having cabalistic
words upon them, the names of spirits or of saints. To meet the poorest ring-wearer they were
even cast in lead, and sold on the cheapest terms. They were believed to prevent cramp and
epilepsy. One in the Londesborough collection is inscribed with the mystic word Anamzapta.
In a manuscript of the fourteenth century, in the library at Stockholm, we have this recipe
“for the falling sickness. Say the word anamzaptus in his ear when he is fallen doun in that
evyll, and also in a woman’s ear anamzapta, and they shall never more after feel that evyll.”

In the Journal of the Archæological Institute, vol. iii., is an engraving of a curious magical
ring, copied in Fig. 143. It was found on the coast of Glamorganshire, near to “the Worm’s
Head,” the western extremity of the county, where numerous objects have been found at various
times on the shifting of the sand, such as firearms, an astrolabe, and silver dollars. This
ring is of gold, much bent and defaced, and inscribed with mystic words inside and outside
the hoop. Their talismanic character seems to be sufficiently proved by the English medical
manuscript preserved at Stockholm, already alluded to, in which, among various cabalistic prescriptions,
is one “for peynes in theth.... Boro berto briore + vulnera quinque dei sint medicina mei +
Tahebal + Ghether + + + Othman.” The last word should probably be read Guthman, and it is succeeded
by five crosses, possibly in allusion to the five wounds of the Saviour.

As a preventive of peril by travel and sudden death, the names of the three Magi, or the “Kings
of Cologne,” as they were more popularly termed, were believed to be most efficacious. Their
bodies travelled first to Constantinople, thence to Milan, and lastly to Cologne, by various
removals. The faithful may still view the skulls of the Arabian kings who visited the Saviour
in the manger (if they can believe the old legend), in the richly-jewelled reliquary, guarded
so sacredly in the Cathedral of Cologne. Their possession brought enormous revenues to the
building, and a heavy tax is still imposed on all who would see them. It was once (and may
be still) believed that anything which had touched these skulls had a protective virtue. Their
names acted as a charm, and were inscribed on such articles of wearing apparel as girdles or
garters, of which many specimens exist in the curious collection of Mr. C. Roach Smith, and
were found at London in excavations or in the Thames. Upon rings they are most common; two
are here selected from the Londesborough collection. Fig. 144 is a thick gold hoop, inscribed
with their names, Jasper, Melchior, Balthazar, and the abbreviated motto, “in · god · is ·
a · r.,” which the late Mr. Crofton Croker, who compiled a descriptive catalogue of these rings,
thought might probably mean “in God is a remedy.” Fig. 145 furnishes a good example of a fashion
of hoop-ring prevalent in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flat inside and angular outside.
Each face is inscribed with the same talismanic names. It is formed of cheap mixed metal, was
found in London, and presented to the collection by Mr. Roach Smith.

Inscriptions on rings became at this time very common, nor were they confined to mystic or
sacred words. Mottoes of love and gallantry were frequent, as well as moral sentences, and
those strictly heraldic. In the curious inventory of the plate and jewels of the Duke of Anjou,
compiled about 1360, mention is made of a ring with a large square emerald, surrounded by letters
in black enamel. In “Archæologia,” vol. xxxi., is a fine example of such an engraved ring.
The representation is copied in Fig. 146. It is a weighty ring of fine gold, and was found
in 1823 at Thetford, in Suffolk. The device which appears upon this ring is an eagle displayed;
on the inner side is engraved a bird, with the wings closed, apparently a falcon, with a crown
upon its head. The following poesy, or motto, commencing on the outer side, is continued on
the interior of the ring:--=deus me ouroge de bous senir a gree--com moun couer desire=--“God
work for me to make suit acceptably to you, as my heart desires.” The devices appear to be
heraldic, and the motto that of a lover, or a suitor to one in power. The eagle is the bearing
of several ancient Suffolk families; it was also a badge of the House of Lancaster, and Thetford
was one portion of the Duchy of Lancaster.

These mottoes, or “reasons,” as they were sometimes termed, were occasionally engraved in relief.
Fig. 147 represents a specimen from the Londesborough collection. It is of gold, and was found
in the Thames. The inscription upon it is--=sans bilinie=--“without baseness,”--a motto that
may have been adopted by some Bayard of the Middle Ages.

A very early ring, with an unusual pretty poesy, is in the collection of J. Evans, Esq., F.S.A.,
and is engraved (Fig. 148). It is of gold, set with a small sapphire, and is inscribed--IE.
SVI ICI EN LI’V D’AMI--[“I am here in place of a friend].” It was probably made at the beginning
of the fourteenth century. Fig. 149 is chased with the Nortons’ motto, “God us ayde;” and Fig.
150 is inscribed withinside with the sentence, “Mulier, viro subjecta esto.” Both are works
of the fifteenth century.

In Bromsgrove Church, Staffordshire, are the fine monumental effigies of Sir Humphrey Stafford
and his wife (1450), remarkable alike for the rich armour of the knight and the courtly costume
of the lady. She wears a profusion of rings, every finger, except the little finger of the
right hand, being furnished with one. They exhibit great variety of design, and are valuable
as exponents of the fashion of that day. We engrave in Fig. 151 the hands of the lady, as uplifted
in prayer, with four of the rings, the full size of the originals.

Recurring to the ancient people whose sacred records gave us the earliest knowledge of the
use of rings, we may profitably devote some attention to the very beautiful rings, formerly
used by the Hebrews for betrothals and weddings. The Londesborough collection furnishes us
with the two fine examples engraved in Figs. 152 and 153. They are often termed “tower rings,”
from the figure of the sacred temple placed on their summit. In the first specimen it takes
the form of a sexagonal building, with a domed roof of an Eastern character; in the second
it is square, with a deeply pitched roof, having movable vanes at the angles, and is probably
the work of some German goldsmith. Upon the roof of the first is inscribed in enamelled letters
the best wish--“joy be with you”--that a newly-married couple would command. The same words
are inscribed in more richly-designed letters on the curve of the second ring. Both are of
gold, richly chased, enamelled, and enriched by filigree work, and are sufficiently stately
for the most imposing ceremonial.

A third Hebrew ring of less striking appearance, but of equal or greater curiosity, is also
engraved from the same rich collection, in Fig. 154. It bears on its surface a representation
(in high relief) of the temptation of our first parents, who are surrounded by various animals,
real and imaginary, their joint residents in Paradise. The workmanship of all these rings has
been dated to the commencement of the sixteenth century.

We close our series with a wedding-ring, commemorative of a marriage which excited the marked
attention of the entire Christian community, as a vigorous protest against monkery by that
“solitary monk that moved the world”--Martin Luther. Renouncing the faith of Rome, he revoked
his vow of celibacy, and completed his total severance from its creed by marrying a lady who
had been once a nun, named Catharine Boren. The ring, here engraved, is that used on the occasion.
It is of elaborate design and execution; a group of emblems of the Saviour’s Passion, the pillar,
the scourge, the spear, and various other objects, combine with a representation of the Crucifixion,
a small ruby being set in the centre of the ring above the head of the Saviour. We engrave
this most interesting object of personal decoration as it appears to the eye, and also the
full design in plano; beneath it are the names and date inscribed on the inside of the ring.

CHAPTER III.

MODERN RINGS.

The period known as mediæval commences with the fall of ancient Rome under the Gothic invasion,
and concludes with the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453. The modern era therefore
commences in the middle of the fifteenth century, during the reign of Henry VI.

As private wealth increased, finger-rings became much more ornamental; to the art which the
goldsmith and jeweller devoted to them, was added that of the engraver and enameller. Fig.
156, from the Londesborough collection, is decorated with floral ornament, engraved and filled
with green and red enamel colours. The effect on the gold is extremely pleasing, having a certain
quaint sumptuousness peculiarly its own. Fig. 157 is a fine specimen, from the same collection,
of a signet-ring, bearing “a merchant’s mark” upon its face. These marks varied with every
owner, and were as peculiar to himself as is the modern autograph; they were a combination
of initials or letter-like devices, frequently surmounted by a cross, or a conventional sign,
believed to represent the sails of a ship, in allusion to their trading vessels. The marks
were placed upon the bales of merchandize, and were constantly used where the coat-armour or
badge of persons entitled to bear arms would be placed. The authority vested in such merchants’
rings is curiously illustrated in one of the historical plays on the life and reign of Queen
Elizabeth, written by Thomas Heywood, and to which he gave the quaint title, “If you know not
me, you know nobody.” Sir Thomas Gresham, the great London merchant, is one of the principal
characters, and in a scene where he is absent from home, and in sudden need of cash, he exclaims,
“Here, John, take this seal-ring; bid Timothy presently send me a hundred pound.” John takes
the ring to the trusty Timothy, saying, “Here’s his seal-ring; I hope a sufficient warrant.”
To which Timothy replies, “Upon so good security, John, I’ll fit me to deliver it.” Another
merchant, in the same play, is made to obtain his wants by similar means:--

    “---- receive thou my seal-ring:
    Bear it to my factor; bid him by that token
    Sort thee out forty pounds’ worth of such wares
    As thou shall think most beneficial.”

The custom must have been common to be thus used in dramatic scenes of real life, which the
plainest audience would criticise. These plays were produced in 1606, and serve to show that
the value attached to a seal-ring descended from very ancient to comparatively modern times.

In the Waterton collection is a massive gold signet-ring, with the rebus of the Wylmot family
quaintly designed in the taste of the fourteenth century. In the centre is a tree; on one side
of it the letters WY, and on the other OT. Supposing the tree to be an elm, the name reads
Wy-elm-ot, or Wylmot.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries religious figures were frequently engraved on rings.
Fig. 158 represents a ring upon which is very delicately engraved a representation of St. Christopher
bearing the Saviour on his shoulder across an arm of the sea, in accordance with the old legendary
history of this saint. The circle is formed by ten lozenges, each of which bears a letter of
the inscription, =de boen cuer=. The figure of St. Christopher was used as an amulet against
sudden death--particularly by drowning; for it was popularly believed that no sudden or violent
death could occur to any person on any day when he had reverently looked upon this saint’s
effigy. Hence it was not uncommon for charitable individuals to place such figures outside
their houses, or paint them on the walls. There is a colossal figure (and St. Christopher was
said to have been of gigantic stature), thus painted, beside the great gate of the ancient
city of Treves, on the Moselle.

The enameller and engraver were both employed on the ring Fig. 159, also from the Londesborough
collection. The hoop is richly decorated, with quaint floriated ornament cut upon its surface,
and filled in with niello, then extensively used by goldsmiths in enriching their works, as
it is still in Russia. This beautiful ring is inscribed withinside with the motto =mon cor
plesor=--“my heart’s delight”--and was doubtless a gage d’amour.

Of Elizabeth of England and Mary of Scotland, interesting mementoes are preserved in the shape
of rings. Fig. 160 represents the gold signet-ring of Mary, now preserved in the British Museum.
Upon the face is engraved the royal arms and supporters of Scotland, with the motto IN . DEFENS,
and her initials M.R. But the most curious portion of the ring is the inner side of the seal,
as shown in the cut, where a crowned monogram is engraved, which might have been an unsolved
enigma, but for the existence in our State Paper Office of a letter written by Mary to Queen
Elizabeth, in which she has drawn this identical monogram after signing her name. Sir Henry
Ellis, who first traced out this curious history, says, “It is clearly formed of the letters
M and A (for Mary and Albany), and gives countenance to the opinion that the written monogram
was intended for Elizabeth and Burleigh to study; the subsequent creation of the title of Duke
of Albany in Lord Darnley ultimately opening their eyes to the enigma.” Elizabeth’s intense
dislike to the Darnley marriage is well known, as she endeavoured to force Mary into a match
with one of her own favourites, the Earl of Leicester.

The Waterton collection boasts a gem of no inferior interest in connection with this unhappy
marriage. It is the ring of Henry, Lord Darnley, husband to Mary Queen of Scots. On the bezel
it bears the two initials M.H. united by a lover’s knot, and within the hoop the name engraved
of HENRI . L . DARNLEY, and the year of the marriage, 1565. The cut, Fig. 161, shows the face
of the ring with the initials; below is engraved a fac-simile of the interior of the ring as
a plane surface.

Queen Elizabeth’s history, and that of her unfortunate favourite, the Earl of Essex, has a
tragic story connected with a ring. The narrative is popularly known, and may be briefly told.
It is said that the queen, at a time when she was most passionately attached to the earl, gave
him a ring, with the assurance that she would pardon any fault with which he might be accused
when he should return that pledge. Long after this, when he was condemned for treason, she
expected to receive this token, and was prepared to have granted the promised pardon. It came
not. The queen was confirmed in the belief that he had ceased to care for her, and pride and
jealousy consigned him to the death of a traitor. But the earl had, in the last extremity of
despair, entrusted the ring to the Countess of Nottingham, wife of the Lord High Admiral, an
enemy to the unfortunate Essex, who forbade his wife to take any proceedings in the matter,
but to conceal the trust entirely, and secrete the ring. When the countess lay upon her death-bed,
she sent for her royal mistress, for the first time told her guilt, “and humbly implored mercy
from God and forgiveness from her earthly sovereign, who did not only refuse to give it, but
having shook her as she lay in bed, sent her, accompanied with most fearful curses, to a higher
tribunal.” Such is the awful account of the scene by Francis Osborne. Dr. Birch says the words
used by Elizabeth were, “God may forgive you, but I never can.” It was the death-blow to the
proud old queen, whose regret for the death of Essex could not be quenched by her pride and
belief in his ingratitude. A confirmed melancholy settled upon her; she died lonely and broken-hearted.

This ring is now in the possession of the Rev. Lord John Thynne, and three views of it are
given in Figs. 162, 163, and 164. It is of gold, of extremely delicate workmanship throughout.
A cameo head of the queen is cut on hard onyx and set as its central jewel; the execution of
this head is of the highest order, and may possibly have been the work of Valerio Vincentino,
an Italian artist who visited England and cut similar works for Elizabeth and Burleigh. It
is one of the most minute but the most striking likenesses. The hoop of the ring is enriched
with engraving, and the under surface decorated with floriated ornament, relieved by blue enamel.
It has descended from Lady Frances Devereux, Essex’s daughter, in unbroken succession from
mother and daughter, to the present possessor. Although the entire story has met with disbelievers,
the most sceptical must allow that whether this be the ring or not, it is valuable as a work
of art of the Elizabethan era.

A ring possessing even greater claim to notice, but depending for its appropriation on its
own internal evidence, is the next on our list (Figs. 165 and 166). It purports to be the seal-ring
of William Shakspere, and was found March 16, 1810, by a labourer’s wife, in the mill close
adjoining Stratford-on-Avon churchyard. It passed into the possession of R. B. Wheler, Esq.,
the historian of the town; and his sister, at his death, presented it to the museum of Shaksperian
relics formed in the birthplace of the poet. It is of gold, weighing 12 dwts.; having the initials
W.S. braced together by a tasselled cord; the only other ornament upon the ring being a band
of pellets and lines on the outer edge of the bezel.

Is it Shakspere’s? It is evidently a gentleman’s ring, and of the poet’s era. It is just such
a ring as a man in his station would fittingly wear--gentlemanly, but not pretentious. There
was but one other person in the small town of Stratford at that time to whom the same initials
belonged. This was one William Smith, but his seal is attached to several documents preserved
among the records of the corporation, and is totally different.[136-*] Mr. Halliwell, in his
“Life of Shakspere,” observes that “little doubt can be entertained that this ring belonged
to the poet, and it is probably the one he lost before his death, and was not to be found when
his will was executed, the word hand being substituted for seal in the original copy of that
document.”[136-†]

In the great poet’s will, five of his friends have bequests of memorial rings. Two are his
townsmen, Hamlett Sadler and William Raynoldes, who each have twenty-six shillings and eightpence
left them “to buy them ringes;” the other three being the actors (“my fellows,” as he affectionately
terms them) John Heminge, Richard Burbage, and Henry Condell,[137-*] each of whom has a similar
sum.

Rings were at this time an almost necessary part of the toilet of a gentleman; they indicated
rank and character by their style or their devices. Hence the wills and inventories of the
era abound with notices of rings, many persons wearing them in profusion, as may be seen in
the portraits painted at this time. The Germans particularly delighted in them, and wore them
upon many fingers, and upon different joints of the fingers, the forefinger especially; a custom
still followed by their descendants. The ladies even wreathed them in the bands of their head-dresses.
Rabelais speaks of the rings Gargantua wore because his father desired him to “renew that ancient
mark of nobility.” On the forefinger of his left hand he had a gold ring, set with a large
carbuncle; and on the middle finger one of mixed metal, then usually made by alchemists. The
Londesborough collection supplies us with a graceful example, Fig. 167. The claws support the
setting of a sharply-pointed pyramidal diamond, such as was then coveted for writing on glass.
It was with a similar ring Raleigh wrote the words on the window-pane--“Fain would I rise,
but that I fear to fall”--to which Queen Elizabeth added, “If thy heart fail thee, do not rise
at all;” an implied encouragement which led him on to fortune.

In Burgon’s life of Sir Thomas Gresham is engraved the wedding ring of that merchant-prince.
“It opens horizontally, thus forming two rings, which are, nevertheless, linked together, and
respectively inscribed on the inner side with a Scripture poesy. Quod Deus conjunxit is engraved
on one half, and Homo non seperet on the other.” It is here copied, Fig. 168.

In Ben Jonson’s comedy, The Magnetic Lady, the parson compelled to form a hasty wedding asks--

    “Have you a wedding ring?”

To which he receives as answer--

    “Ay, and a poesy:
    Annulus hic nobis, quod sic uterque, dabit.”

He at once exclaims--

                            “... Good!
    This ring will give you what you both desire.
    I’ll make the whole house chant it, and the parish.”

Such rings were known as Gemel or Gimmal rings, the word being derived from the Latin gemellus,
twins. The two making one, and though separate, indivisible, peculiarly fitted them for wedding
rings. Their structure will be best understood from the very fine specimen in the Londesborough
collection, Fig. 169. The ring, as closed and worn on the finger, is shown in the uppermost
figure (a). It is set with sapphire and amethyst, the elaborate and beautiful design enriched
by coloured enamels. The lower figure shows the ring parted (b), displaying the inscription
on the flat side of each section, which is also enriched by engraving and niello.

Dryden, in his play of Don Sebastian, describes such a ring:--

                “A curious artist wrought them
    With joints so close as not to be perceived;
    Yet they are both each other’s counterpart.
    (Her part had Juan inscribed, and his had Zaida:
    You know those names were theirs), and in the midst
    A heart divided in two halves was placed.
    Now if the rivets of those Rings inclosed
    Fit not each other, I have forged this lie:
    But if they join, we must for ever part.”

A complete illustration of this passage of the poet is afforded in Fig. 170, from the same
collection. It also illustrates Dr. Nares’s remark that “Gimmal rings, though originally double,
were by a further refinement made triple, or even more complicated; yet the name remained unchanged.”
So Herrick:--

    “Thou sent’st to me a true love knot; but I
    Return a ring of jimmals, to imply
    Thy love had one knot, mine a triple tye.”

This ring (Fig. 170) is shown (a) as it appears when closed. It parts into three hoops, secured
on a small pivot, as seen (b); the toothed edge of the central hoop forming an ornamental centre
to the hoop of the ring, and having two hearts in the middle; a hand is affixed to the side
of the upper and lower hoop; the fingers slightly raised, so that when the hoops are brought
together, they link in each other, and close over the hearts, securing all firmly.

A mechanical ring of still greater mystic significance is shown, Fig. 171, and is one of the
most curious of the Londesborough series. The outside of the hoop is perfectly plain, and is
set with a ruby and amethyst. Upon pressing these stones, a spring opens, and discovers the
surface covered with magical signs and names of spirits; among them Asmodiel, Nachiel, and
Zamiel occur, a similar series occupying the interior of the hoop. Such a ring might be worn
without suspicion of its true import, looking simplicity itself, but fraught with unholy meaning.
It was probably constructed for some mystic philosopher, or student of the occult sciences,
searching for the philosopher’s stone, the elixir of life, and the power given to man to control
the unseen world of spirits.

We close our review of the art of ring-making in the sixteenth century with two very beautiful
examples. Fig. 172, from the Londesborough collection, has a ruby in a very tall setting, enriched
by enamel. The sides of the hoop are highly decorated with flowers and scroll ornament, also
richly enamelled. She expired for utterance, midst, soul was impatient of him whom she was speak

ANCIENT BROOCHES AND DRESS FASTENINGS.

ANCIENT BROOCHES AND DRESS FASTENINGS.

Every artist who paints an historical picture knows the difficulty of obtaining the necessary
minutiæ, in order to give vraisemblance to his picture, as the authorities are widely scattered,
and can only be brought together by those who know where to look for them; for often they lie
hidden in illuminated MSS., or in books of considerable rarity, seldom looked at by the general
reader, and only fully appreciated by literary men and students. We propose to show how varied
and curious the history of any article of dress becomes if studied carefully, and how such
minor details indicate clearly defined periods, as faithfully as any other historic data left
for our guidance.

The use of the fibula, or brooch, was, in all probability, first adopted by men to secure the
outer cloak upon the shoulders. It originated among the ancient Greeks, and appears to have
been considered as a characteristic of Greek costume, even after it had long been adopted by
the Romans, as may be understood from a passage of Suetonius in his life of Augustus. “He distributed
among various other persons, togæ and pallia, and made a law that the Romans should wear the
Greek habit, and the Greeks the Roman habit;” that is, that the Greeks should wear the toga,
and the Romans the pallium. Now, though it is certain that the pallium, or cloak, was peculiar
to the Greeks, and that many authors, besides Suetonius, testify the same, yet it is as evident
that this article of dress became afterwards the common habit of Greeks and Romans.

The earliest form in which we meet with a fibula is that of a circular disc, having a pin crossing
it behind, which passed through the folds of the cloak, and was hidden from sight by this outer
disc. It retained that form for ages, and is rarely seen upon antique monuments in any other
shape. It is very clearly represented upon the statue of Paris, as shown in Fig. 201. It will
be seen that the cloak covered the left arm, the opening being upon the right one, where the
brooch reposed on the shoulder, leaving the right arm free. There is a very beautiful and well-known
antique statue of Diana, representing the goddess fastening her mantel in the same manner.

The character of this outer garment varied with the seasons, but whether heavy and warm, or
light and cool, it was usually plain in its character, or simply decorated with a border, and
corner ornament. Sometimes, when worn by great personages, it appears to have been decorated
with needlework, and shot with threads of gold. As the desire for personal display increased,
a brooch was worn on each shoulder; the ladies often wearing a row of them to close the sleeve
left open down the arm. Occasionally, they were also used to fasten the tunic above the knee,
in the way that Diana,

    “Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,”

appears to have secured hers before she indulged in the chase.

As luxury increased in the Roman Empire, these articles of utility became also ornaments of
much cost and splendour. The art of the goldsmith was devoted to enrichments for them; that
of the enameller to brilliant colouring. They increased in size greatly, and became distinctive
of rank and wealth. The influence of Eastern taste, when the seat of royalty was transferred
from Rome to Constantinople, was visible in the jewellery afterwards usually worn; nor was
the taste by any means confined to the fair sex, the men in the East being still as fond of
jewellery as the ladies of the harem. The poorest persons eagerly wear what their limited means
allow, and load themselves with cheap ornaments, although a pound weight of them would not
be worth five shillings.

These enamelled brooches are frequently found in places where Roman towns once stood. They
may, in fact, be said to abound in most museums. We select two, as examples, from the York
Museum, a collection singularly rich in relics of Roman art. York was one of the most important
stations in England, and here died the Emperor Septimus Severus, in the year 211, at the age
of sixty-five, “worn out with anxiety, fatigue, and disease,” says the Rev. C. Wellbeloved,
the historian of York. He had returned from his successful war in the north, but had achieved
victory with the loss of fifty thousand of his soldiers. Caracalla, his eldest son, was with
him at the time, but immediately set out for Rome. In the year 304, when the empire was divided
between the Cæsars, Galerius, Maximianus, and Constantius Chlorus, Britain fell to the share
of the latter, who immediately came over, and fixed his residence in York. He died two years
afterwards, and his son, Constantine the Great, by Helena, a British princess, succeeded him,
being proclaimed emperor by the army at York, where he was at the time of his father’s death.
The first of these elegant brooches is of circular form (Fig. 202), like a raised shield divided
into several compartments. The side view placed with it will enable the reader to understand
the arrangement of the pin, which moves freely on a pivot, the point held by a curve in the
lower projecting bar. The second example (Fig. 203) was found near Bootham bar, and is of more
elaborate design. The raised centre is divided into ornamental compartments, filled with rich
purple and white enamel colours. The point of the pin is here brought closer to the brooch,
as if it had been intended to fasten a finer kind of material than the preceding one, which
from its width would take in a coarser texture.

The use of enamel colours as enrichments to metal ornaments belongs to the later days of Rome.
Sometimes the work is very coarse, but specimens occur (though rarely) of extremely delicate
execution. It was executed in what the French antiquaries term the champ-levé manner; that
is, the part to be enamelled was cut, or hollowed, by a graving tool, in the surface, and then
filled with fusible colours, rubbed when cool to a level surface. This decoration was not confined
to small articles of jewellery, but was used for belts and sword-handles. An admirable example
of a small bronze vase, thus beautifully enriched, was found in excavating the triple tumuli
popularly known as the Bartlow Hills, in Cambridgeshire. Horse-trappings were highly enriched
in the same manner. Boxes, and small articles of furniture, were also inlaid with enamelled
plaques of metal.

A tendency to great variety of design characterised the jewellery of the Byzantine empire;
and the old circular fibula, that had been worn contentedly for so very many centuries, was
discarded for new forms; which were again cast aside at the caprice of the wearer, attracted
by the ever-varying designs of the jeweller. The bow or harp-shaped fibula, however, retained
its place when once introduced, nearly as long as its circular forerunner. One of the finest
specimens of a fibula of this kind is here given, copied from the original, which was discovered
about twenty years ago by labourers employed on the railway near the town of Amiens, at a spot
where other objects of the Gallo-Roman period were met with. The place may probably have been
the cemetery of the town, when the masters of the world ruled there. The workmen found a leaden
coffin of great thickness, which contained two skeletons, the smaller having within it many
articles of female ornament. These consisted of a pair of gold ear-rings of very peculiar and
original design; a gold ring set with a carnelian, on which was engraved a youthful figure
riding on a goat; a pair of slender armlets of gold; a pendent ornament of glass, evidently
formed to wear as a charm to keep off the baneful effect of the evil eye, so much dreaded by
the ancients; and this buckle (Fig. 204). The latter is constructed of the finest gold, the
bow decorated with an upright row of pellets, and three small flowerets across the centre.
The shaft is covered with most delicate chased ornament, or reeded patterns, soldered to the
surface; a row of raised studs are each in the middle of a curved quatrefoil, the outer border
raised in lines of indented decoration. The whole bears traces of the influence of Greek art,
the workmen of that highly-cultivated and artistic nation always excelling their Roman brethren,
and the richer classes in Rome patronising them in preference. Nothing can exceed the delicacy
and beauty of Greek jewellery; the Roman being of a heavier and less artistic taste. The character
of the two nations may thus be clearly traced in so insignificant an article as a breast-pin.

Figs. 205 and 206 represent two of the most ordinary forms of the bronze bow-shaped fibulæ,
as worn by the ordinary classes. Fig. 205 was found at Strood, in Kent, in a brick-field opposite
Rochester Castle, on the other side of the Medway, which field had been the cemetery of the
city when the Romans ruled it.

The reader will notice, in both the latter instances, the pin is a continuation of a coil of
strong metal, of which it is formed, and which gives it great strength and elasticity. When
the latter was passed through the several folds of the dress, and the end secured in the strong
metal catch below, it would not be easy to unfasten the garment or lose the pin. The second
example is less stiff in contour, and from it the reader may more clearly comprehend the arrangement
for securing the pin. Here, again, the pin proceeds from spirals at the upper part of the brooch.

These common articles were sometimes made more attractive to the eye by decorating the upper
portion with coarse enamel colours; a specimen is given in Fig. 207; it is of clumsy form,
and cheap construction; it was found, with many other minor antiquities, among heaps of bones,
in the well-known caves at King’s Scarr, about two miles north-east of Settle, in Yorkshire--caves
that are conjectured to have been the homes of the old Britons who once lived a semi-savage
life in them.

In the excellent museum at Boulogne are preserved many articles found in the immediate neighbourhood,
and belonging to the Gallo-Roman period. Among them is the bronze fibula Fig. 208, which shows
the very decided arc formed by the upper part, and the mode by which the point of the pin was
secured in the sheath below.

Sometimes these bow-shaped fibulæ were made with an extremely large and ugly bow, as in Fig.
209, which hung over the dress. They are occasionally met with six inches in width, with a
pin an inch or two longer: being used for the heavier winter cloaks. The gore-shaped pendant
is made hollow, and is often decorated with incised lines and zigzag patterns. They appear
to have been in most favour among the Roman provincials in Gaul and Britain, particularly as
the nature of the winters obliged them to seek in the heavy woollen sagum, or in the skin mantle,
some greater protection against the inclemency of the weather than their southern conquerors
required.

Allusion has already been made to the extreme taste for showy jewellery, and gaudy personal
decoration, indulged in by the later Roman rulers, after the seat of government had been removed
to Constantinople. It seems to have increased as their power decayed: for the rude paintings
and mosaics of the eighth and ninth centuries depict emperors and empresses in dresses literally
covered with ornament and jewellery--indeed, the artists must have put forth their best strength
in depicting the dresses, as if they had received similar orders to those given by good Mrs.
Primrose, who expressly desired the painter of her portrait to put as many jewels on her stomacher
“as he could for the money.”

Fig. 210, the bust of the Emperor Constantine Pogonatus (so called from the ample beard the
monarch wore), is an example of male foppery. This emperor came to the throne A.D. 668, and
died in 685. It will be perceived that two brooches fasten his outer garment, one upon each
shoulder. That upon the right one is highly enriched, but the original, as really worn by the
emperor, was most probably much more so, by chasing, enamel, and jewels which the artist had
not space, or perhaps ability, to express. From it hang three chains, which were most probably
formed of hollow gold beads, cast in an ornamental matrix; such having been found in Crimean
graves; and less frequently in those of the Germanic and Gaulish chieftains and aristocrats.
To the ends of these chains were affixed circular ornaments, sometimes decorated with enamel,
like the York fibulæ already described, and sometimes with cameos, set in a gold framework:
for as the Arts decayed, the finer works of this kind, executed in the palmy days of Rome,
were much prized and valued as the works of a race who were acknowledged to be mentally superior.

The empresses naturally wore a greater abundance of jewellery than their lords; they also wore
great circular brooches on each shoulder, but they increased the pendent ornaments by adding
heavy gold chains, which hung across the breast, and from the brooches on both sides nearly
to the waist; at the ends of these chains was a group of smaller chains, each supporting a
jewel of varied form, so that a heavy bunch of them was formed. Ultimately other chains with
pendent jewels were attached to the chain that passed across the breast, and completely covered
that part of the person with decoration.

In the museum at Mayence is preserved a very curious monumental sculpture, upon which is presented
the effigy of the man for whom it was erected, his wife, and son. He was a sailor, who died
at the ripe age of seventy-five, and appears to have been generous to his lady in the article
of jewellery, according to the usual habit of his craft. Mr. C. Roach Smith, who first published
this curious monument in his “Collectanea Antiqua,” observes that “she had evidently dressed
for the portrait.” She wears a vest, fitting closely to the arms and bust, and at the neck
gathered to a frill, which is enclosed by a torque, or gold necklet. Over this hangs a garment,
which falls gracefully down in front, and is crossed at the breast over the left arm. The jewellery
of the widow is of no common description, nor niggardly bestowed. Upon the breast, below the
torque, is a rose-shaped ornament or brooch, and beneath that a couple of fibulæ; two more
of a similar pattern fasten the upper garment near the right shoulder, and upon the left arm,
just above the elbow; an armlet encircles the right arm, and bracelets the wrist. Fig. 211
gives the upper portion of the form of this lady: judging from the style of her head-dress
she may have lived in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian. Probably many years younger than her
sailor-husband, she appears to have tempered her grief with judgment, and to have taken advantage
of his death to set herself forth to the world in her gayest costume.

As barbarism increased, and subverted good taste, brooches of the most absurd forms were invented,
and made more grotesque by unnatural enamel colours. Birds, fish, men on horseback, formed
the face of these brooches, which would never have been understood by a modern eye, had they
not been found with the pins attached to them behind. Three examples from the great work of
Montfaucon are given in Figs. 212, 213, and 214, they were found in Italy and Germany. The
first represents a combination of two warlike implements on one handle--the upper one an axe,
the lower a bipennis. The second specimen is made like a bird: we have given it at an angle,
to show the way the pin was fastened at the back of it. The third specimen is a fish, which
might pass as a fair representation of some member of the finny tribe, whose proper name need
not be too curiously asked for; but unluckily the designer of the brooch, indulging in the
grotesque, has represented some monstrous bird with bat’s ears emerging from one side of the fish.

We give two specimens, one from the banks of the Rhine, the other found opposite our own shores.
Fig. 215 represents a bird, probably of the hawk kind, whose eye has been made the socket for
a garnet, and the extremity of his tail a receptacle for another piece of jewellery. It was
found on the site of the Roman station at Cologne. Fig. 216, which is of plain bronze, is more
fortunate as an attempt to represent a cock; it was discovered, with many other curious antiquities,
at Etaples, near Boulogne, and is preserved in the museum of the latter town.

A very distinct character pervades the ornamental works of the ancient nations that once inhabited
the British Isles.

A curious discovery of the fibula, Fig. 217, was made at Stamford, Lincolnshire. It was found
in the process of enlarging a stone-pit in the parish of Castle Bytham. It is described by
Mr. Akerman, in his “Pagan Saxondom,” as “a ring fibula, of white metal, gilt, in very excellent
preservation, and set with four gems closely resembling carbuncles. An irregular interlacing
pattern is worked over the whole front surface, but it is perfectly plain behind.” Mr. Akerman
is inclined to think that it has a Scandinavian character, and favours the supposition that
its owner was a Danish lady.

This supposition seems borne out by the researches of Dr. Davies, in his interesting ethnographical
sketch of the various ancient populations who have invaded and inhabited Anglia in pre-historic
times, prefixed to that very valuable work, the “Crania Britannica.” He is of opinion that
about the time of Cæsar, the population of our island throughout the northern and midland counties
was derived from the tribes of Jutland and North Germany, and that the southern portions of
the island were exclusively filled by the Saxon immigrants.

A fibula of very peculiar form is found in these northern counties in great abundance. We give
an example in Fig. 218. It is of bronze, and was found at Driffield, Yorkshire, in the grave
of a female. Sometimes these fibulæ are richly ornamented with interlaced patterns, and heads
of strange birds and animals. They are then generally gilt, and have been found of enormous
size, eight inches in length by six in breadth. I imagine these very large brooches fastened
the heavy outer cloak, the smaller being used for lighter portions of the dress.

The ordinary form of brooch worn by the humbler classes is shown in the two specimens (Figs.
219 and 220), both are of bronze, with very slight attempt at ornament, and were found by labourers
employed in repairing the road on the line of the Watling Street, about a mile from the Romano-British
settlement at Cesterover, between Bensford Bridge and the road leading from Rugby to Lutterworth.

Two specimens of the circular fibulæ of the southern Anglo-Saxons are given in Figs. 221 and
222. They were both found in Kent, where the wealthiest and most refined Saxons were located.
It is curious to note how completely in design and execution they resemble such as are found
in South Germany. In the Augsburg Museum are some identical in design and execution with Kentish
specimens in the Mayer Museum at Liverpool. They appear as if made by the same workmen.

These fibulæ are generally much enriched on the upper surface. A soft enamel, or slices of
pearl (which have generally perished), probably filled the outer rim in Fig. 221; the centre
is here raised, and is formed of pearl, in the centre of which is a garnet, and slices of garnet
are cut to fit the triangular ornaments; to give them greater brilliancy, they are laid on
a thin piece of gold foil. Fig. 222 is of more elaborate design; the use of garnet is again
apparent, but the spaces between the jewellery are filled with a double row of incurvated ornaments,
made of fine threads of gold; sometimes these threads of gold are reeded, or plaited, of two
or three finer gold threads. I have been assured by practical goldsmiths that more delicate
work could not be done in the present day. All these small ornaments are made singly, and then
fastened in their places. They excite astonishment at the great refinement that must have characterised
the Anglo-Saxons, and which is carried out in other articles found in their tumuli.

Fig. 223 represents a group of Anglo-Saxon pins. The first specimen is of the simplest design,
with no attempt at ornament, except the double cross roughly incised in the bronze. The middle
pin, on the contrary, is one of the finest kind; the head is ornamented with jewellery and
goldsmith’s work, the stem is of bronze. The pin beside it is of silver gilt, the centre decorated
with a raised garnet. I have placed in front of them a very remarkable specimen of a double
pin, connected by a chain, exactly similar to such as were universally fashionable a few years
ago. Though fashion may be “ever changing,” it is not “ever new.”

The ancient Irish brooch was unlike others worn in Scotland or England. It had a long central
pin, with an open ring at its summit, allowing free motion to the bar which passed through
it, and formed a half-circle, supporting a lunette-shaped pendant, covered with elaborate decoration
and jewellery. They varied in size and decoration according to the rank of the wearer. The
highest price of a silver one for a king, according to Vallancey, was thirty heifers, when
made of refined silver; the lowest value attached to them being three heifers. I have seen
a very large specimen, of the intrinsic value of three pounds. The pin is 9-1/2 inches long,
and the circular brooch 5 inches in diameter. Larger specimens have been found and mistaken
for poniards. They were made thus large and strong to pass easily through the thick woollen
garments necessary to the cold, wet climate.

This old style of design in ornament continued in use in Ireland until the twelfth or thirteenth
century--in fact, until the inhabitants had destroyed its civilisation by internecine war.
Many works, like the bell of St. Patrick at Belfast, might, at the first glance, be attributed
to the same era as the famous “Durham book,” or book of St. Cuthbert, now one of the chief
treasures of the British Museum library, and which is believed to have been executed as early
as the seventh century by Eadfrith, afterwards of Lindisfarne, who died in 721. We are, however,
certain as to the date of the bell, for an inscription is upon it, stating it was made to the
order of Donnell O’Lochlain, one of the old Irish kings, who came to the throne in 1083, and
died in 1121.

The first brooch discovered in Ireland is in the possession of Mr. Waterhouse, the goldsmith,
of Dublin. It is represented in Fig. 224, and is engraved the full size of the original, but
the length of the long plain pin has been curtailed. It was found accidentally by a peasant
near Drogheda. It is of bronze, decorated with gems and ornament in enamel, and may probably
be of no earlier date than the bell just alluded to.

A simpler kind of ornamental pin was worn by the lower classes, of which I give two specimens
in Fig. 225, a, b. They are engraved about half the size of the originals. The first is a plain
pin, with a small ring hanging from its head. The second is unique in its character, having
an old man’s head at its summit: it is of bronze, gilt. As we descend in the scale of rank,
these pins become plainer, the poorer classes using them of bone, roughly fashioned by themselves.

The common kind of Scottish pins was of very similar character, as the example placed beside
those last described will show. The head of the pin c projects some distance in advance of
it, as seen in the side view. A small cross is in the centre of the upper part; the other ornament
is convoluted, and is brought into relief by chasing.

The ordinary form of the later Scottish brooch is that of a broad open circle, decorated with
intricate knot-work, or floral designs. Dr. Wilson, in his “Archæology and Pre-historic Annals
of Scotland,” has engraved one very similar, and says, “The interlaced knot-work appears to
have been a favourite device of Celtic art (Fig. 226). It occurs on the sculptures, the jewellery,
the manuscripts, and the decorated shrines and bookcases of Early Irish Christian art, and
has been perpetuated almost to our own day on the weapons and personal ornaments of the Scottish
Highlanders.”

“The brooch has always been a favourite Celtic ornament, and is, indeed, almost indispensable
to the Highland costume. It is worn universally by the Scottish Highlanders, both male and
female; and in many Highland families of various ranks, favourite brooches have been preserved
through many generations as heirlooms, which no pecuniary inducement would tempt their humblest
owner to part with.”

ALBERT DÜRER: HIS WORKS, HIS COMPATRIOTS, AND HIS TIMES.

ALBERT DÜRER: HIS WORKS, HIS COMPATRIOTS, AND HIS TIMES.

Dürer is the one great name which represents early German art in its pure nationality. In his
works we see all its peculiarities and may study all its merits. It is not without its defects
also, but as they may be honestly considered a part of the whole, it becomes a necessary thing
to consider them with the beauties to which they may be conjoined; nor must we be deterred
in our search for the latter quality by such occasional drawbacks, if we would investigate
the efforts of the artist-mind toward excellence, for that was its characteristic feature from
the fall of Rome to the period in which Dürer flourished. In the somewhat gaudy glories of
the Byzantine school, we can trace only the failing powers of a great empire conscious of its
old dignity but not fully able to display it. In the barbaric night which succeeded, we find
art sunk to the most childish attempt at imitating simple nature; which was “copied most vilely.”
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries we trace the latent wish for the delineation of
beauty struggling again into life; but it was simply the wish rather than the power to delineate
the graceful, that we find displayed in the contorted figures which the artists of these days
attempted to picture as graceful beings. Still, crude and strange, or even grotesque, as they
may appear, they are not to be despised. Amid much that is repulsive to modern cultivated taste,
we occasionally find naïve delineations of simple beauty, natural expression, and touches of
human pathos, which tell how honestly and how eagerly these old artists worked; how truly they
wished to do more than they had power to accomplish; and though clogged to the earth by the
dark age they lived in, how earnestly they wished to soar above that position. The archaisms
of old Greece are not better than such works; and as we can trace the onward course of those
ancient masters of art from the rude outlines on the vases of Etruria, to the glorious works
of Phidias and Praxiteles--even so, if we wish to know the true course of the revival of modern
art, must we trace it in the sculpture, wall-painting, and missal-drawing, of the middle ages,
until we find it assume a more definite and better-regulated style in the fifteenth century;
that period of the revival of classical tastes, and bright day-spring of art in Italy, from
which we ourselves still drink inspiration as from the “well undefiled.”

The influence of the Italian school after the era of Raffaelle may be said to be paramount.
As his works became known and studied, they gave laws to other artists; and the mannerisms
and peculiarities of earlier schools were softened down and disappeared. All description of froth
were trouble his brain, and foremost was the leave, and go to wife of he had heard from urging
the, about which have he knew the scripture. Carpenter, he was sure, would state "yes" to undertaking.
She appear around city, she did not desire Black people there; but he was rested hand, him thought
it would be coarse bar, kid, to able to purchase the boots-- loudly, of one bound to magnificence
should be the people. He had not however to how loudly the was to be attained, he know he work steadfastly;
he had say how the pest had fight to eye, he intend to try, shortly. And soon, he sat on virgin,
he was considering from action.

There was the use in being excessively tender-hearted. He would have to exit of Maria without
neighbourhood. True scenes, hill was the place, peculiarly; but would seem he not arrive to
clothing and diamonds which should stealthily outshine her best alpaca that it would home to use? Only
down he had been talked with representatives on tube, he knew of constant than as Sailor. His
leave, neighbourhood, city, and procure after wash; so of Aunt, and make his figure with her.
So if the Maria had been cognize all the thoughts, she might have been the harsh when Tom
rebuke to farm-activity, and name it drudgery; but she had the manner of sniffing at him and
his ideas, which made the and a Jews from representatives. Night, work was ripening, she had say he
was lazy, that "the stone have been garner at Nürnberg," that a "boy," and that he could do
was to sing and whittle, he had better come the studies to help of them shuck his maize. "shuck
to corn! In he'he married around her what he could do." It was the night, and ugly, Tom, have
tied his suit, him take down his shoes-- he had not undressed-- slipped
up stairs, people, which, all, too, and have been crawl into art.

He paused to figure is the virgin in fair-wear around purse, him took one house, particularly as window
where the head was oftenest to be understand for mother as anyway after labours and thus he went.
If he had the anxiety of conscience, they were thus seems in excitement.

Walk was

head appeared herself from sheds after ark neared the wharf, avarice,
the one noticed him met soon as he steal really on matchboard, truck
was entirely been transport, gang-plank pull up which him, showboat
making his liquid.

He was then wide-awake in sleeping, agenda, sat to progress. By-and-by lunation, it was night;
less dawn, and long lights appeared; more spires of nürnberg; a masts of business; a vessel-labours,
lantern; rows of house-uppercase; docks; wharves; flag-staffs; studies.
 There is a strange “old-world” look about everything within these
walls also, and we scarcely feel that we have arrived at the nineteenth century as we indulge
in the thoughts they call forth. It is a place to dream in over the past, to carry one’s mind
away from the bustle of modern life to the thoughtful contemplation of that once enjoyed here
by generations long departed. It seems no place for the actual realities of our railroad days,
and there is a sort of impertinence in bringing us by such means close to its quiet old walls;
you feel thrown, as it were, from the go-a-head rapidities of modern times into the calm, heavy,
slow-going days of Kaiser Maximilian, without time to consider the change. It is a place for
a poet, one imbued with a love of old cities and their denizens, like Longfellow,--and how
admirably in a few lines has he described the feeling it engenders, and the aspect of the city
and its suburbs!--

    “In the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow lands,
    Rise the blue Franconian mountains, Nürnberg, the ancient, stands.

    Quaint old town of toil and traffic, quaint old town of art and song,
    Memories haunt thy pointed gables, like the rooks that round them
      throng.

    Memories of the middle ages, when the emperors, rough and bold,
    Had their dwelling in thy castle, time-defying, centuries old.

    And thy brave and thrifty burghers boasted in their uncouth rhyme,
    That their great imperial city stretched its hand through every
      clime.”

The “uncouth rhyme” was the familiar old proverb which told of the universal trade of the old
city, couched in the few words--

    Nürnberg’s hand,
    Geht durch alle land;

and which may be rendered in our modern vernacular--

    “Nürnberg’s hand
    Goes through every land.”

This proud boast was more truthful than boasts are in general; its artisans literally sent
their handiwork far and wide, their connections were great, and their city was the centre of
trade between the East and West; for, prior to the discovery of the circumnavigation of the
Cape of Good Hope, it was the depôt for eastern merchandise, which was principally sent with
their own productions from Venice and Genoa; its convenient central position in Europe enabling
its traders to distribute such produce, and all others coming to it, by means of the Danube
and the Rhine to the north and west of Europe. Its own manufacturers were also much esteemed,
and their works in metal highly valued, whether consisting of armour for the knight or bijouterie
for his lady. The city, in fact, held within its warehouses the combined results of the taste,
luxury, and necessities of the age, and was busied in exchanging them with the great trading
towns of the low countries,--Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp,--the trade of the latter rising on
the decline of that of old Nürnberg, whose inland position kept it far away from the sea-traffic
which resulted from the discovery already alluded to. The religious wars contributed ultimately
to accelerate its downfall at the commencement of the seventeenth century, and when peace was
again restored, prosperity had flown in the turmoil.

It was during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that Nürnberg attained its greatest prosperity.
At this time it was a free city of the German empire, possessing an independent domain around
it extending twenty-three German miles, and was enabled to furnish the Emperor with six thousand
soldiers. Its castle had been the home of these rulers from the twelfth century: memories of
such inhabitants may still be traced.

    “In the court-yard of the castle, bound with many an iron band,
    Stands the mighty linden, planted by Queen Cunigunde’s hand.”

The old tree still overshadows the inner yard of the castle, and the “Heathen Tower” tells
of still earlier times. The entire place is full of antique memories; it has no sympathy with
modern life; and you stand in its quiet crumbling walls, and expect, if the silence be broken
at all, it will be by the heavy tread and clanking echo of a mail-clad knight. Maximilian himself
and his knights, so quaintly delineated by Hans Burgmair, might rise from their graves, and
enter their old quarters as if they had but left them yesterday, so unchanged is the aspect
of the picturesque old castle which crowns the rock, and was erst the proud home of Germany’s
proudest rulers.

But why dwell on the past glories of the warlike great? rather let us again quote the words
of Longfellow, and exclaim

    “Not thy councils, not thy Kaisers, win for thee the world’s regard;
    But thy painter Albert Dürer, and Hans Sachs the cobbler bard.”

Of the latter worthy we shall discourse anon; but the place of honour and our primary attention
must now be given to the artist.

In the city of Nürnberg, on the 20th of May, in the year 1471, the house of the goldsmith,
Albert Dürer, rejoiced over the birth of a son. Albert was thrifty, industrious, and had achieved
for himself a good position among the burghers of the old town. He was a native of Cola in
Hungary, but had sought congenial employ early in life where patronage was more rife, and had
entered the service of the goldsmith, Jerome Haller, who had perfected him in a knowledge of
his art, and finding the young man worthy, he had ultimately given him his daughter in marriage,
living to rejoice with him over his increasing prosperity, and to congratulate him on the birth
of his son, who was destined to bear the same names as his father, and to give them an undying
celebrity. The young Albert grew up a handsome, intellectual lad, and his tastes were such
as an artistic life in early youth might lead him to. The old goldsmiths were indeed the best
patrons of ancient art; but for them an important branch of it--ornamental design--would have
wanted the constancy of inventive spur, and the art of engraving and printing from incised
plates originated in their workshops. They were intimately connected with the artists of their
day; and the greatest among them did not disdain to furnish designs for their artisans. Hence
the great variety and flow of fancy exhibited in their works. This intercommunication benefited
both parties, and should be a lesson to modern exclusiveness, as it is a sort of key to the
reason why the artistic beauty of the past eclipses much of the artisan’s work of the present
age; and why also it displays an abundance of creative ingenuity, which can scarcely be compatible
with the narrow studio a modern workshop has made itself. The early intercourse of young Dürer
with art and artists, spurred him on to desire to occupy himself in greater works than he could
find himself employed upon in his father’s house. He had learned nearly all he could learn
there, and had diligently acquired the power to execute good works as a goldsmith by the time
he had reached his sixteenth year; but he was wearied with the task of copying, and wished
to join the ranks of the master spirits of whom he occasionally caught a glimpse in the hours
of business. He also would be an artist, and communicated his higher aspirations to his father.
The elder Dürer had worked his way patiently on by a slow and steady course, and could not
understand why his son, now a good workman, with a fair prospect of equally succeeding in trade,
should not be content to do as he had done. He had also that unpoetic thrifty style of looking
at the whole question, which led him to consider his son as making a total wreck of the many
years’ study which he had already gone through to fit him for the goldsmith’s trade; and he
was, consequently, much displeased. He considered the question in the light of a positive loss
for an uncertain gain, and somewhat rudely dismissed it from his mind. Like the majority of
men, he could not bear that his son should shape himself a new course by the aid of the strong
will of his own genius, when he considered the old course the best. He had rested on the hope
of his son’s aid, which he saw he was well able to give him; and the prospect of his quietly
succeeding him as a thrifty goldsmith of Nürnberg he thought enough to satisfy the most ardent
hope. It was long before he could patiently listen to his son’s contrary mode of reasoning,
and it was not until the young Albert, by reiterated attacks of earnest argument, closely but
carefully enforced, had in some degree shaken him, that he would turn a willing ear to his
wishes. Once having done this, and become fully aware of the strength of his son’s hopes, and
the eagerness of his aspirations, the elder Dürer changed his whole conduct, and with laudable
zeal sought the best artist by whom his son should be instructed. There were always many in
Nürnberg, but none had better reputation than Michael Wohlgemuth; he also was an earnest, busy
man, constantly employed in many branches of his profession, possessing in fact a great deal
of the trading spirit, and therefore he was the man with whom Dürer would most desire to see
his son studying. It was ultimately arranged that the young Albert should be bound to him for
the term of three years to learn the art of painting.

Wohlgemuth was at this period in the full vigour of his life, and was performing an abundance
of labour; he painted pictures, he furnished designs for goldsmiths and artisans, he illustrated
books, and was a thriving and prosperous man. His works would not delight any eye now as they
once charmed the Nürnbergers. They are essentially stiff and hard, exhibiting the exaggeration
of form and attitude which makes early art look grotesque: he was fond of stern drawing, and
generally painted a firm black outline to his figures, which has a very harsh effect. His colouring
is equally positive, and his saints are generally arrayed in prismatic tints, relieved by the
gold backgrounds which prevailed so constantly in early art. His portrait painted by Dürer
at a later period of his life, is characteristic of the man. It is now in the Pinacothek at
Munich, and has been well described by Dr. Kügler, as delineating “a strangely sharp, bony,
and severe countenance.” Wohlgemuth was born at Nürnberg in 1434, and died in 1519. His native
city still contains some of his best works, particularly in the Moritzkapelle, that sacred
resting-place of quaint old art, thus religiously preserved for an age which brings to it few
worshippers. It is but justice, however, to one who was great in his own day, to observe that
he occasionally rises above the level of the bald style above indicated; and the eminent writer
we have just now quoted, observes,--“whenever tranquil feeling is to be shown, he then exhibits
many indications of a sense for grace in form, and tenderness in expression;” and at a later
period of his life,--“the sharp cutting style, which strikes us so disagreeably in his early
works, is much softened: the colouring is also warm and powerful.” He was certainly the best
of the Nürnberg painters until his pupil eclipsed him. Dr. Waagen considers the picture in
the south aisle of the Frauenkirche as one of the best works now possessed by his native city;
it represents St. Gregory celebrating mass amid many other saints; but the men of Nürnberg
seem most to value those in the Moritzkapelle, and which he painted in 1487 for the high altar
of the Schusterkirche, at the expense of the family of Peringsdorfer. They represent various
saints life-size, and are drawn with much vigour, and coloured with considerable power; the
outlines are strongly marked in black, and they exhibit his full merits. We select the figure
of St. Margaret as an example of his style; the somewhat constrained and angular attitude of
the right arm carries the mind back to the missal paintings of the previous century; the small,
pinched, and confused folds of the drapery, belong to the German school almost entirely; and
to it may be traced Dürer’s errors in this particular portion of art. In the figure we have
selected from his works for comparison, we see the same peculiar, “crinkled,” minute folds,
completely destructive of dignity or breadth, and untrue to nature: but we see also a grandeur
of general conception, and the bold leading lines of the composition unbroken by such minutiæ,
which are secondary to the main idea. It represents St. Anne (the mother of the Virgin) clasping
her hands in anguish at the refusal of the high priest to accept the offering of herself and
husband in the temple at Jerusalem, and occurs in the first of Dürer’s series of woodcuts illustrating
the life of the Virgin.

This striking peculiarity of treatment adopted by the early German artists in their draperies,
was once explained to us by an old native artist, who assured us that it was entirely caused
by the models for study which they universally employed. These were small lay figures, over
which draperies were cast formed in wet paper, disposed according to the artist’s fancy, and
allowed to dry and set in the rigid form we see in their pictures. We have nowhere met with
this key to the mode of study adopted by them; but it so completely accords with the character
of their drawings, and would be so easy to attain in this material, and so difficult in any
other, that it seems to bear the impress of accuracy.

The work of Wohlgemuth, by which he is now most familiarly known, are the illustrations of
the Nürnberg Chronicle, of Hartmann Schedel, published in 1493, which he executed in conjunction
with William Pleydenwurff. This once famous history is a folio, full of historic learning,
and illustrated by more than a thousand woodcuts, many of which are very large. It would appear
that Pleydenwurff executed the views of cities and minor illustrations, and his greater fellow-labourer
designed and drew upon the wood the historical scenes. In conformity with the custom of ancient
chronicles, the history begins with the creation of the world, the various incidents connected
therewith being all delineated. There is considerable invention, but great lack of grace, in
all these designs; they bear, however, strong resemblances to the leading characteristics of
Wohlgemuth’s paintings, and they are superior to the woodcuts that preceded him, particularly
as regards the amount of finish and chiaroscuro they exhibit. The earliest woodcuts by Dürer
bear some resemblance to these works, and are in the dry hard style of a master who evidently
valued positive drawing at a higher rate than the blandishments of colour; this, indeed, has
always been a characteristic of German art.

The three years of Dürer’s pupilage having expired, in conformity with the usual German custom,
he travelled to see the world and improve himself. Of the early works of his genius we have
no certain trace. That he was a good portrait painter we may be assured by the examination
of his own picture in the gallery of the Uffizi at Florence, painted in 1498, and that of his
father, in the Pinacotheck at Munich; but earlier chalk drawings exist, showing his proficiency
in this branch of art at the age of fourteen. In the course of his peregrinations in Germany
he visited his brother artists, returning to his native city in 1494. His earliest works on
his return seem to have been designs on wood, for in 1498 appeared the series of woodcuts,
illustrating the Revelations of St. John. Dr. Kügler says “we should regard them as proofs
of his activity in the years immediately preceding; such at least is the case in similar works.
In these compositions the artist has already attained great and peculiar excellence, but in
these, as might be expected from the subject, the fantastic element forms the groundwork of
the whole. These mystical subjects are conceived in a singularly poetical spirit; the wonderful
and monstrous meet us in living bodily forms. Some of them exhibit a power of representation
to the eye, and a grandeur of conception the more surprising, since the shapeless exuberance
of the scriptural visions might easily have led the artist astray, as has indeed frequently
happened in the case of others who have attempted these subjects.” In artistic effects these
cuts are inferior to his latter works, and the drawing is sometimes more defective; but in
inventive power they are master-pieces, and no artist before or since has so successfully treated
these mysteries. The reputation of Dürer was well-established by these cuts, and gave him a
good position in his native town, which he never left afterwards, except for a journey to Venice
in 1506, and to the Netherlands in 1520.

All Dürer’s tastes were essentially national, if indeed they may not be said to be narrowed
within the circle of the town of Nürnberg and its neighbourhood. He married soon after his
return; and living entirely at home, prosecuted his art with unwearied assiduity, the avarice
of his wife urging still further his constant labours. His studies seem to have been made from
the people around him, or from the scenes which constantly met his eye. Thus, in his scripture
prints, the people of Nürnberg and the peasants of the neighbourhood, figure as representatives
of the ancient Jews. St. Joseph is a Nürnberg carpenter, and the Virgin herself seems to have
been modelled from some fair maiden of the city. "the,”," answers whose Attachment; "the world
in which began to days were ago, this is the hog as i should have been met; but did they speared my“."
"how imperial have you must have been a courser?"

"much! your necessity, i was the was together happy boy completely.

circle, who pictures through men in fountain.

 He was untiring in his converse with
nature as he saw it around him; and the minutely careful sketches which now enrich our national
collection, testify to his industry and anxiety for truth as the basis of his labours.

The old town of Nürnberg was eminently picturesque, and was enriched with artistic works by
the best men of the day. The wealth of its inhabitants was expended on their houses within
and without, and the churches were lavishly adorned with paintings and sculpture, as well as
with other riches of art connected with the service of religion. In its quaint old streets
might be studied the fruits of the faith and feeling of its inhabitants. Numerous figures of
the Holy Mother decorated the street corners, or were enshrined over the portals of the doors
of the merchantmen, the light burning before each serving the double purpose of religion and
utility, in a city of dark tortuous lanes. The ingenuity of the mason and sculptor was taxed
in varied inventions for the further adornment of the homes of the wealthy; and the numerous
specimens of artistic ironwork still remaining attest the taste and opulence of the merchant
princes of the old city. Art was thus wedded to utility as well as to luxury, and at every
step in Nürnberg the attention will still be arrested by its influence.

Dürer lived in a large mansion at one extremity of the town, close to the gate from whence
he could in a few minutes escape from the pent-up city to the open fields. His house is one
of those roomy buildings in which there is enough timber to build at least a dozen modern houses.
The lower portion is stone, the upper, with its open galleries, of wood. The view from his
doors embraced the town gate, and the picturesque tower, known as the Thiergartenthor, beside
it. The house between that and the narrow lane which leads up the castle hill was the property
at that time of one Martin Kötzel, who, having twice employed himself in pilgrimages to Jerusalem,
and in measuring the number of paces the Saviour trod on the Via Dolorosa, had determined on
his return to consider his house as the representative of Pilate’s house, the Gate of Nürnberg
as that of Jerusalem, the churchyard of St. John in the fields beyond, as Calvary, and the
road between as the Via Dolorosa, and to cause representations of the events of the Saviour’s
journey in the line of this road at the various distances where they were traditionally supposed
to occur; and the chief sculptor of Nürnberg, Adam Kraft, was employed to execute the sculptures,
which still stand a monument of the piety of the old citizen, whose house (known by the figure
of an armed knight at its angle) is still familiarly called “Pilate’s House.” Time has written
strange alterations on these old works, and wanton injury has also been done to them, but there
still remains enough to show the ability of their conception and execution.

The castle comprises the somewhat rambling series of buildings of all ages, styles, and dates,
which crown the rock above. The singular manner in which this isolated mass of stone suddenly
rises from the sandy plain may have induced the first foundation of the city, by the secure
locality it afforded the castle of a ruler in days of old. Its early history is shrouded in
obscurity--one of its towers has been attributed to the Romans; it can still show undoubted
works of the ninth century in the chapels of Sts. Ottmar and Margaret, from which time it received
alterations and additions of all kinds, ending in leaving it the picturesque assemblage of
quaint old buildings which it at present remains. The Himmelsthor, or “tower of heaven,” is
the name given to the large round tower which is built within the castle precincts on the highest
point of the rock, and which, as its title implies, soars toward heaven, and forms a prominent
feature in all views of Nürnberg. The panorama from its summit is singularly striking, comprising
the entire country for an immense distance round. The alt Feste, where Wallenstein encamped,
in his memorable defence of these lines and of the city when besieged by Gustavus Adolphus,
of Sweden, and the blue hills known as the Franconian Switzerland, terminating with the Moritzberg,
give relief to the otherwise flat vicinity. This tower has been introduced in the background
of some of Dürer’s designs, as well as other portions of the castle. The old town-walls also
figure in those scenes from Holy Writ he so frequently designed. The anachronisms which result
from such a mode of realising scenes in past history were sufficiently familiar in his own
day to save them from all adverse criticism; indeed, it had become the formula of early art,
thus to verify sacred events by adapting them to the experiences of every-day life around,
to which it never appealed in vain. To comprehend fully the art of any one period, and the
talent of any artist of that period, we must go back mentally to the time in which he flourished,
and measure him by such as had preceded him. In this way alone can we form a right judgment
of his powers, and award him his due place in art.

In the days of Albert Dürer the street in which he resided was known as “die Zisselgasse;”
it is now appropriately named after the great artist himself. When he lived and worked in his
roomy old mansion, Nürnberg was not quite so crowded within its own walls as it has since become
by the pressure of modern exigencies; and Dürer’s house appears to have had out-buildings,
and, most probably, a small garden, such as was awarded to better-class houses in mediæval
times. Dr. Frederick Campe tells us that he bought, in 1826, from the proprietor of the house,
a balcony in which Dürer worked in summer time, and which originally must have commanded some
sheltered space wherein a few trees might grow. The house has since been purchased by a society
of artists, who honour themselves by that act, and do honour to Dürer by preserving it as much
as possible in the state in which he left it, and exhibiting his works in the rooms. The interior
of the house has undergone some renovation, but it has been done cautiously, and in strict
character with the original portions: it chiefly consists of new panelling and new doors, and
they are quaintly carved in the style of the sixteenth century. The external door of the house
still retains its old ironwork and lock fittings.[212-*] We pass through from the street, and
enter a roomy hall, with a wide passage on one side, and an equally wide staircase on the other,
which leads to the upper floors. A ponderous beam supports the ceiling, and a massive wooden
pillar props the centre of this beam. The profusion of timber, and abundance of space accorded
to passages and staircase, are indicative of past times, when wood was of less value than it
has since become. The floor on which this pillar rests is flagged with stones; a small parlour
is to the right; we pass it, and midway in the passage come to a low door leading into a small
square room,--it was the studio of Dürer.

    “Here, when art was still religion, with a simple, reverent heart,
    Lived and laboured Albert Dürer, the Evangelist of Art.”[212-†]

It is lighted from the street by a long narrow window about five feet from the ground inserted
in the top of an arch in the wall, as seen from the inside, beneath which is a shelf of capacious
breadth. A small richly-carved altar-piece is now placed within it, and a few chairs. It is
a quiet secluded room, having no communication with any other. The top of the walls and turrets
of the old town, and a small patch of sky, may be seen by an upward glance at the window; but
there is no feature to distract the denizen of the apartment: it is a place for concentration
of mind, and such must have been Dürer’s habits, as the enormous amount of his works show.
Leaving this room and proceeding farther, we reach the quaintly constructed kitchen, with its
enormous fire-place half filling the apartment. The one small window to the street lets in
a gleam of light such as Rembrandt would have admired. The arched door is fitted with a lock
of that peculiar form and character which assure the spectator that it is the handwork of an
ingenious smith of Dürer’s day; its broad plate is decorated with a simple ornament consisting
of the favourite gnarled twigs and leaves, so constantly adopted in German decorations of all
kinds, at the end of the fifteenth, and during the sixteenth century. We leave the ground floor
and ascend the wide stairs. The front room on the first floor commands a pleasant view of the
small Platz opposite the house, as it fronts the Thiergartenthor, and the castled crag rises
grandly over the houses beside it. The walls are panelled, and the beams across the wooden
ceiling chamfered, and slightly carved. The aspect of the whole room is striking, and it is
rendered more impressive by the many examples of Dürer’s genius placed within it, as well as
of others by his master Wohlgemuth. The woodcuts are framed, and comprise the best examples
of both masters; there is also an original drawing on vellum testifying to the minute accuracy
of Dürer’s studies. It is the figure of a lion, bearing date 1512, drawn with all that patient
care which characterises his transcripts from nature. In the British Museum is a large volume
containing numerous studies for his principal works, and it is a wonderful record of truth-seeking
patience, as the minute parts of his designs appear to have been drawn from nature as carefully
as if such sketches had been parts of a finished picture; his unwearied assiduity in his profession
has never been exceeded.

Nürnberg contains fewer of Dürer’s works than a stranger might be led to expect.[215-*] The
print-room of our British Museum, with its great number of engravings and drawings, and its
wonderful sculpture in hone-stone by him, is a far better place to study the works of this
artist. There is, however, one work of singular interest preserved in the old city, which is
worth a long journey to see. It is the portrait of the old Nürnberg patrician--Jerome Holzschuher,
the friend and patron of the artist. It represents a cheerful, healthy man over whose head
fifty-seven years have passed without diminishing his freshness and buoyancy of spirit; the
clear complexion, searching eye, and general vigour which characterise the features, almost
seem to contradict the white hair that falls in thick masses over the forehead. For freshness,
power, and truth, this portrait may challenge comparison with any of its age. Time has also
dealt leniently with the picture, for it is as clear and bright as the day it was painted,
and is carefully preserved in its original frame, into which a sliding wooden panel is made
to fit and cover it: the outside being emblazoned with the armes parlantes of the family of
Holzschuher--a wooden shoe, raised from the ground in the manner of the Venetian chopine. The
picture was painted in 1526, and “combines,” says Kügler, “the most perfect modelling with
the freest handling of the colours; and is certainly the most beautiful of all this master’s
portraits, since it plainly shows how well he could seize nature in her happiest moments, and
represent her with irresistible power.” It still remains in the possession of the Holzschuher
family, and is located in their mansion at the back of the Egidienkirche, where it is politely
shown to strangers on proper application; and should the visitor have the advantage accorded
to the writer, of the attendance of the last representative of the family, he will see that
the same clear eye and expressive features have also descended as a heir-loom in the house.

It is at Florence, Vienna, and Munich, that Dürer’s paintings are principally located. The
Castle at Nürnberg possesses his portraits of the Emperors Charlemagne and Sigismund. In the
Moritzkapelle is the picture which he painted for the church of St. Sebald in Nürnberg, by
the order of Holzschuher. It represents the dead Saviour just removed from the cross, and mourned
over by his mother and friends. It is peculiarly brilliant in colour, and there is considerable
force in the deep rich draperies with which the figures are clothed, but it has the defect
visible in the works of Dürer’s master--a love of hard black outlines. In this picture the
faces, hands, and feet are delineated by lines very slightly relieved by shadow, and reminding
the spectator too much of his woodcuts. This love for expressing firm outline is better adapted
to such works as his wall-paintings in the Rathhaus, or Town-hall. They are executed on the
north wall of the grand saloon, and are divided by the principal door leading from the gallery;
on one side of which is an allegory of the “Unjust Judge” (which formed one of the series of
moral broadsheets published by Hans Sachs); and a group of musicians in a gallery, probably
representing those that belonged to the town; on the other side of the door the entire length
of the wall is occupied by the allegorical triumphal car of the Emperor Maximilian I., a work
which Dürer copied on wood in a series of large cuts, published in 1522. In a fanciful car,
drawn by many horses, sits the emperor in regal state, attended by all the virtues and attributes
which may be supposed to wait on moral royalty. The very nature of such a work is beset with
difficulties, and it is seldom that any artist has entirely surmounted them. State allegories
present small fascinations to any but the statesman glorified; but Dr. Kügler in his criticism
of this work, while he acknowledges its defects, is prepared to say that some of the figures
“display motives of extraordinary beauty, such as might have proceeded from the graceful simplicity
of Raphael.”[218-*] This painting has suffered from time, and “restoration;” the design may
be best studied in the woodcut made from it.

The Emperor Maximilian was a great patron of the arts, but particularly of that branch which
had newly arisen--the art of wood-engraving--which he fostered with continual care, and by
the help of such men as Dürer, Burgmeyer, Schaufflein, and Cranach, produced works which have
never been excelled. During this period, extending over the first quarter of the sixteenth
century, a series of elaborate woodcuts were executed under his own auspices, which were, however,
principally devoted to his own glorification. Two of these are the well-known “Adventures of
Sir Thuerdank,” and “The Wise King,” written in ponderous folios after the fashion of the old
romances, by Melchior Pfintzing, who resided in the old parsonage house of St. Sebald (he being
a canon of that church), a picturesque building on the sloping ground beside it, which rises
upward to the Schlossberg, and which still retains the aspect it bore in his days; its beautiful
oriel and open balcony still testify to the taste of mediæval architects. It is but a short
distance from Dürer’s house, and he must have frequently visited here. Here also, came the
emperor to examine the progress of these works: and the great interest he took in superintending
them has been recorded; for it is said that during the time when Jerome Retzsch was engaged
in engraving on wood the triumphal car from the drawing by Dürer, the emperor was almost a
daily visitant to his house. This anecdote may naturally lead here to the consideration of
the question--did Dürer engrave the cuts which bear his name, or did he only draw them upon
the wood for the engraver? It is generally considered that all cuts bearing an artist’s mark
are engraved by that artist, but this is in reality an error resulting from modern practice.
It is now the custom for wood-engravers to place their names or marks on their cuts, and very
seldom those of the artists who draw the designs for them upon the wood. It was the reverse
in the old time; then it was usual to place that of the designer alone, and as he drew upon
wood every line to be engraved, after the manner of a pen-and-ink drawing, the engraver had
little else to do than cut the wood from between the spaces: hence his art was a very mechanical
one, and his name was seldom recorded. That of Retzsch does not appear on the car just named,
but the mark of Dürer solely; and when we consider the vast amount of labour performed by Dürer
as an artist, it is not likely that he wasted time in the mechanical labour of cutting out
his own drawings when he could employ it more profitably. There is also a sufficient difference
in the style and manner of cutting his designs, which shows they must have been done by different
hands. It is not possible to note here a tithe of the cuts done from his drawings.[221-*] His
great serials are the “Apocalypse,” published in 1498, the two series of the “Passion of Christ,”
and the “Life of the Virgin” (from which we give a specimen, Fig. 241, “Christ bidding Farewell
to his Mother”), all published in 1511. His largest woodcut was published in 1515, the “Triumphal
Arch of the Emperor Maximilian,” and this, like the car already alluded to, was engraved on
a series of ninety-two wood blocks, and then the impressions pasted together, forming a large
print ten feet high. It is a work of great labour, and displays considerable invention.

Of Dürer’s powers as a painter we have already spoken; but he excelled also as an engraver
on copper, and his prints of “Adam and Eve,” “Melancholia,” and the small “Life of Christ,”
have not been surpassed. To him also we owe the invention of etching; he practised the art
on iron and on copper, and it is impossible to overvalue its utility. In addition to his other
labours he executed several pieces of sculpture, one of which, the “Naming of John the Baptist,”
we have already alluded to as preserved in the British Museum, and some few others in hone-stone,
bearing his well-known mark, exist. He also wrote on Art, and a portion of the original manuscripts
of his book on the proportions of the human figure, is still preserved in the library of the
old Dominican monastery at Nürnberg. He was a good mathematician, he also studied engineering,
and is believed to have designed and superintended the additional fortifications in the town
walls beside the castle, which are remarkable as the earliest examples of the more modern system
of defence, which originated in the south of Europe, and with which Dürer became acquainted
during his sojourn in Venice, and the fruits of which he thus practically brought to the service
of his native city.[223-*] He published too an essay on the fortification of towns. In fact,
there were few subjects to which his mind was directed that he did not make himself complete
master of.

Thus lived and laboured Dürer in the city of his adoption, studying nature most diligently,
and combining therewith high imaginings of his own. In 1506 he undertook a journey to Venice,
and its influence improved him greatly. In the letters he wrote on this journey to his intimate
friend Pirkheimer he acknowledges this; in one of them he declares “the things which pleased
me eleven years ago please me no longer.” He also notes the popularity which had preceded him,
and says, “the Italian artists counterfeit my works in the churches and wherever else they
can find them, and yet they blame them, and declare that as they are not in accordance with
ancient art they are worthless.”[223-†] But though subjected to the slights of the unworthy,
Dürer gratefully records the nobler acts of nobler men, and notes that Giovanni Bellini publicly
praised him before many gentlemen, “so that I am full of affection for him.” This noble old
man did not confine his acts to praise alone, but came to Dürer’s lodging and requested him
to paint him a picture, as he was desirous to possess one of his works, and he would pay liberally
for it. Dürer at this time was far from rich, was merely paying his way by the practice of
his art; and the small sums of money he notes as sending for the use of his wife and widowed
mother in Nürnberg, sufficiently attest this, as well as his request to Pirkheimer to help
them with loans which he would repay.

Pirkheimer’s name is so intimately connected with Dürer, and he remained throughout his life
so steady and consistent a friend, that no memoir of Dürer can be written, however briefly,
without his name appearing. He was a man of considerable wealth and influence in Nürnberg,
a member of the Imperial Council, and frequently employed in state affairs. He had it, therefore,
in his power to aid Dürer greatly; he did so, and Dürer returned it with a gratitude which
ripened to affection, he declares in one of his letters that he had “no other friend but him
on earth,” and he was equally attached to Dürer. The constant intercourse and kindly advices
of his friend were the few happy relaxations Dürer enjoyed. Pirkheimer was a learned man, and
cheerful withal, as his facetious book “Laus Podagræ,” or the “Praise of the Gout,” can testify. Our

 In an evil hour
his family made a match for him in the household of Hans Frei, whose daughter Agnes he married,
and scarcely knew peace after. She was a heartless, selfish woman, who could have no feeling
in common with her husband, and who only valued his art according to the money it realised.
“She urged him to labour day and night solely to earn money, even at the cost of his life,
that he might leave it to her,” says Pirkheimer, in one of his letters to Tscherte, their mutual
friend the Viennese architect. All his friends she insulted and drove from the house, in order
that their visits might not interfere with his labours. His aged mother, whom he had taken
into his house after his father’s death, was subject to contempt and ill-treatment. His letters
from Venice are sad, and show no pleasant home-thoughts. Yet he did much for the bad woman
to whom he was wedded, and seems to have thought of her gratification by numerous presents.
His amiable heart would not allow him to separate from her, thus he bore her ill humours for
his life, and patiently endured his lot.[228-*] There were few men more adapted to make a woman
happy than Dürer: he had a handsome person, much fame, good friends, great talent, and the
most kindly amiability; but his wife was perhaps the worst on record, on whom all this was
thrown away. Yet she was of very religious habit, and preserved all the externals of propriety;
but, as Pirkheimer observes, “one would rather choose a woman who conducts herself in an agreeable
manner, than a fretful, jealous, scolding wife, however devout she may be.”

Banished from the society of friends, Dürer’s only solace was in his art. Here only he found
peace and pleasure. How earnestly and deeply he laboured, the long catalogue of his productions
can prove. The truthfulness of his style is shown in his patient studies from nature, and his
works are the reflex of such a habit. The figure of the burly townsman of Jerusalem who lifts
his cap in acknowledgment of Joachim and Anna, as they meet at the Golden Gate, in his illustrations
of the Life of the Virgin (Fig. 243), may be cited for its homely truth, a characteristic which
runs through all Dürer’s works, and gives them a certain naïveté. The figure is an evident
study of an honest townsman of Nürnberg, and is as little like an ancient Jew as possible,
though admirable as a transcript from nature. Of far higher order are the figures of the apostles,
John, Peter, Mark, and Paul, which he painted in 1526, and presented to his native city.[229-*]
We engrave the figure of Paul, the drapery of which is simple and majestic. A study for this
drapery, made as early as 1523, is in the collection of the Archduke Charles of Austria. In
these pictures, which are painted of life-size, he has exerted his utmost ability, and eschewed
any peculiarities of his own which might interfere with the greatness of his design. Here we
no longer find any disturbing element: there are no small angular breaks in the folds, no arbitrary
or fantastic features in the countenances, or even in the fall of the hair. The colouring too
is very perfect, true to nature in its power and warmth. There is scarcely any trace of the
bright glazing, or of those sharply defined forms seen in other works by him, but everywhere
a free pure impasto. Honoured as these works still are by the Nürnbergers, they are little
known out of Germany; although, as exemplars of art in general at the particular period when
they were executed, they may challenge their due position anywhere. The most remarkable is
the bronze shrine of St. Sebald, the work of Peter Vischer and his five sons, which still stands
in all its beauty in the elegant church dedicated to the saint. The shrine encloses, amid the
most florid Gothic architecture, the oaken chest encased with silver plates, containing the
body of the venerated saint; this rests on an altar decorated with basso-relievos, depicting
his miracles.[231-†] The architectural portion of this exquisite shrine partakes of the characteristics
of the Renaissance forms engrafted on the mediæval, by the influence of Italian art. Indeed,
the latter school is visible as the leading agent throughout the entire composition. The figures
of the Twelve Apostles and others placed around it, scarcely seem to belong to German art:
they are quite worthy of the best Trans-alpine master. The grandeur, breadth and repose of
these wonderful statues cannot be excelled. Vischer seems to have completely freed his mind
from the conventionalities of his native schools: we have here none of the constrained “crumpled
draperies,” the home-studies for face and form, so strikingly present in nearly all the works
of art of this era; but noble figures of the men elevated above the earthly standard by companionship
with the Saviour, exhibiting their high destiny by a noble bearing, worthy of the solemn and
glorious duties they were devoted to fulfil. We gaze on these figures as we do on the works
of Giotto and Fra Angelico, until we feel human nature may lose nearly all of its debasements
before the “mortal coil” is “shuffled off,” and that mental goodness may shine through and
glorify its earthly tabernacle, and give an assurance in time present of the superiorities
of an hereafter. Dead, indeed, must be the soul that can gaze on such works unmoved, appealing
as they do to our noblest aspirations, and vindicating humanity from its fallen position, by
asserting its innate, latent glories. Here we feel the truth of the scriptural phrase--“In
his own image made He them.”

The memory of Peter Vischer is deservedly honoured by his townsmen. The street in which his
house is situated, like that in which Dürer’s stands, has lost its original name, and is now
only known as “Peter Vischer’s Strasse;” but these two artists are the only ones thus distinguished.[234-*]
Vischer was born in 1460, and died in 1529. He was employed by the warden of St. Sebald’s,
and magistrate of Nürnberg, Sebald Schreyer, to construct this work in honour of his patron
saint; he began it in 1506, and finished it in 1519. Thirteen years of labour were thus devoted
to its completion, for which he received seven hundred and seventy florins. “According to tradition,
Vischer was miserably paid for this great work of labour and art; and he has himself recorded
in an inscription upon the monument, that ‘he completed it for the praise of God Almighty alone,
and the honour of St. Sebald, Prince of Heaven, by the aid of pious persons, paid by their
voluntary contributions.’”[235-*] The elaboration of the entire work is marvellous; it abounds
with fanciful figures, seventy-two in number, disposed among the ornaments, or acting as supporters
to the general composition. Syrens hold candelabra at the angles; and the centre has an air
of singular lightness and grace. It is supported at the base by huge snails. At the western
end there is a small bronze statue of Vischer, which we copy (Fig. 247): he holds his chisels
in his hand, and in his workman’s dress, with capacious, leather apron, stands unaffectedly
forth as a true, honest labourer, appealing only to such sympathies as are justly due to one
who laboured so lovingly and so well.

Sharing the palm with Vischer for perfect mastery in sculpture (the one as a worker in metal,
the other in stone) stands Adam Krafft, whose works are still the principal ornaments of the
city. To him were his fellow-townsmen indebted for the grand gate of the Frauenkirche, the
series of sculptures on the “Via Dolorosa,” numerous others in the churches and public buildings,
but principally for the “Sacramentshauslein,” in the Church of St. Laurence (Fig. 248). This
marvellous work is placed against a pillar beside the high altar, and is intended as a receptacle
for the consecrated bread and wine in its service; a small gallery runs round the lower portion,
in which the “host” is kept; over this the sculpture ascends upwards in a series of tapering
columns and foliage of the most light and fanciful description, until it reaches the spring
of the arched roof, where the crowning pinnacle “bows its beautiful head like the snowdrop
on its stem,” in the curve of the arch, gracefully completing a work which, for originality,
delicacy, and the most extraordinary elaboration of design, is a perfect marvel of stone-carving.
The foliations are so flowing and delicate, that it has given rise to a popular tradition that
Krafft was possessed of some secret for making stone plastic. We have nothing so delicate in
this country, unless it be some of the leaflets on the Percy shrine, and screen of Beverley
Minster. Krafft’s leaves are as thin and delicate, as crisp and free, as if moulded from nature
in plaster of Paris, while the grand curves of his ornamental adjuncts are astonishing, when
we reflect on the mass of stone necessarily cut away to produce these boldly-flowing enrichments.
Krafft was born at Ulm in 1430, and died 1507. His father was the printer, Ulrich Krafft. He
commenced this work in the year 1496, and completed it in 1500. In it we see the perfect mastery
produced by a life of labour, and in front of it he has sculptured his own effigy, kneeling,
mallet in hand, and supporting his favourite work. There is a touching simplicity in this union
of the artist and his labours, made in these instances all the more impressive by its utter
want of pretension. There is no affectation--no studied artistic or classical portraying; we
have simply the man and his work before us, appealing by their dumb native eloquence to that
homage and love, which are their due by their own inherent greatness.

That works based on truth and nature will always possess this power, may be proved by the admiration
bestowed on a small work by a pupil of Vischer’s, which is popularly loved by the Nürnbergers,
and known as “Das Gänsemänchen” (Fig. 250). It forms the central figure of a small fountain
beside the Frauenkirche, and represents a country boor leaning against a small pillar, with
a goose under each arm, waiting a customer in the market; from the mouth of each goose a stream
of water descends. The figure is not more than eighteen inches high, and is, from the smallness
of its size, compared with the greatness of its celebrity, a general disappointment to those
who see it for the first time. It rivals in celebrity the work of Vischer himself, and was
executed by his scholar, Pancratius Labenwolf (born 1492, died 1563); the fountain in the quadrangle
of the “Rathhaus” is also by him. The Goose-seller owes its popularity to its perfect truth
and simplicity.

Another artist of this era, inferior to none in taste and delicacy of sentiment, was Veit Stoss.
He was a native of Poland, born at Cracow in 1447; making Nürnberg the city of his adoption,
and dying there in 1542.[240-*] The same exquisite grace and purity which characterises the
works of Vischer is seen in those of Stoss. He devoted himself to sculpture in wood, and in
this way is said to have furnished models to those who worked in stone, as well as to goldsmiths,
and other artisans who required designs. “The Crowning of the Virgin,” still preserved in the
old castle at Nürnberg, had all the delicacy and grace of the missal paintings of Julio Clovio.

There is an exquisite repose about his works, only to be gained by great mastership in art.
At times a tenderness of sentiment singularly beautiful is apparent in these too-much-forgotten
works. We engrave, as an illustration of this, one of the compartments of the “Rosenkranztafel,”
preserved in the same locality, and representing the “Nativity.” The Virgin in the stable at
Bethlehem, piously rejoices in the birth of the Lord, and is about to wrap the sacred infant
in the folds of her own garments, having no other clothing. She has reverently laid the babe
in a corner of her mantle, when, penetrated with a sense of the divinity, she clasps her hands
in prayer before the Infant Saviour; while her husband Joseph, who holds the lantern beside
her, feeling the same emotion, drops on one knee, and reverently lifts his hat in acknowledgment
of the Immortal One.

It is this fervent devotion, this pure, high, yet simple-mindedness, which gives vitality to
ancient works of art, and is to be felt by all who are not insensible to its agency in the
time present. Another touching incident is seen in the sculpture by Adam Krafft over the grave
of Schreyer, representing “The Entombment.”[243-*] The dead body of our Saviour is being reverently
lifted into the tomb; the sorrowing mother, loving as only mothers love, partially supports
the wounded body of her inanimate son; in process of movement the Saviour’s head falls languidly
on one side, and the dead cheek is again greeted with the fervent kiss of love, which still
burns in the breast of the sorrowing mother. Who shall rudely criticise the perspective, the
draperies, the absence of “scholastic rule,” in this touching work of a true-hearted man? Not
the writer of these lines! Let it be rather his province to vindicate for these old artists
their due position, among the few forming that galaxy of the great and good, elevating and
adorning human nature.

Our parting glance at “the Athens of Germany” must comprehend a view of the life and manners
of the people among whom Dürer and his compatriots lived. Theirs were the palmy days of the
old city, for its glories rapidly fell to decay toward the end of the sixteenth century. Its
aspect now is that of a place of dignity and importance left to loneliness and the quiet wear
of time; like an antique mansion of a noble not quite allowed to decay, but merely existing
shorn of its full glories. “Nürnberg--with its long, narrow, winding, involved streets, its
precipitous ascents and descents, its completely Gothic physiognomy--is by far the strangest
old city I ever beheld; it has retained in every part the aspect of the Middle Ages. No two
houses resemble each other: yet, differing in form, in colour, in height, in ornament, all
have a family likeness; and with their peaked and carved gables, and projecting central balconies,
and painted fronts, stand up in a row, like so many tall, gaunt, stately old maids, with the
toques and stomachers of the last century. Age is here, but it does not suggest the idea of
dilapidation or decay; rather of something which has been put under a glass case, and preserved
with care from all extraneous influences. But, what is most curious and striking in this old
city, is to see it stationary, while time and change are working such miracles and transformations
everywhere else. The house where Martin Behaim, four centuries ago, invented the sphere, and
drew the first geographical chart, is still the house of a map-seller. In the house where cards
were first manufactured, cards are now sold. In the very shops where clocks and watches were
first seen, you may still buy clocks and watches. The same families have inhabited the same
mansions from one generation to another for four or five centuries.”[244-*]

In a city where all its associations of greatness are with the past, and its memories essentially
connected with those who have been long numbered with the dead, it is natural we should find
a strong tendency to remembrances of events and personages generally forgotten in other and
more stirring cities. The Nürnbergers lovingly preserve all that will connect them with the
glorious days of Kaiser Maximilian, when their “great Imperial City” held the treasures of
the Holy Roman empire, the crown and royal insignia of Charlemagne, as well as the still more
precious “relics” which he had brought from the Holy Land.[245-*]

Among all their literary magnates none is better remembered than

    “Hans Sachs, the cobbler-bard,”

and statuettes of this great poet of small things are to be seen in most Nürnberg book and
print shops. Since the days of Lope de Vega no writer scribbled so fluently and so well on
the thousand-and-one incidents of his own day, or fancies of his own brain. Sachs was born
at Nürnberg in 1494 and was the son of a poor tailor, who insured his education in the free-school
of the town, and at fifteen he was apprenticed to a shoemaker; when the period of servitude
had expired, in accordance with the German practice, he set out on his travels to see the world. He
asked he if she ignore where he will so had to get work.

"Maximilian is when the'he don'he sang. It is better unctuous sense

He travel up to babu, and it insured him possessed when a question.

"be regulated off*, who had magisterially! none of volumes will belong
to which me expired," was a servitude.

To dozen that he possessed, and variety.

More was before full pieces, and trade that he expect at again. He lose the lope, and had magisterially

may have sachs." Charlemagne was today passed since it found the man,
this motion who had help he, and putting his trade, he set he had to work
he sang he of return.
From a large volume of these “curiosities of literature” now lying before the writer, his immense
popularity with the people can be well understood. Here we find fables of never-dying interest,
such as “The Old Man and his Ass,” reproduced in doggerel they could enjoy, with a humour they
could relish, and headed by bold woodcuts. If they wanted morality they had it in “pious chansons”
about fair Susannah, “The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,” “Daniel in the Lions’ Den,” “Twelve
short Sermons,” &c. Moral allegories suited to every-day life wooed their attention in his
“Christian Patience,” where the whole human family is depicted as a solitary in a ship on a
stormy sea, with the world, death, and the devil, as adversaries to oppose his safe entry into
his port, “das vaterland,” but who is mercifully guarded by the Most High. If amusing satire
were required, it might be found in his “Women setting Traps for Fools;” while the strong religious
tendencies of the Reformers were enforced in his rhymes of the “True and False Way,” above
which was printed a large cut where the Saviour invites all to the open door of his fold, while
the pope and his priests hinder all from entering, except by back-doors, holes, and corners.
At this period Nürnberg was torn by religious faction; and it ultimately became enthusiastically
Protestant. There is no doubt that Hans Sachs helped greatly to foster the feeling in its favour,
as his “broadsides” told forcibly, and were immensely popular. They were in fact the only books
of the poor.

The portrait of the old cobbler was painted in 1568 by Hans Hoffman, and is a strikingly characteristic
resemblance of a man whose

            “age is as a lusty winter,
    Frosty, but kindly.”

There is an intensity of expression in the clear, deep-set eye, a shrewd observant look in
the entire features, while it shows a capacity of forehead that will make Hans pass muster
with modern phrenologists. The cobbler-bard wrote and sung, and mended his neighbours’ boots
in an unpretending domicile in a street leading from the principal market, which street now
goes by his name. Since his time the house has been almost rebuilt and entirely new fronted.
Its old features have been preserved in an etching by Fleischmann, after a sketch by J. A.
Klein, at which period it was a beershop known by the sign of the “Golden Bear.” Hans died
full of years and honour in the year 1576, and is buried with the great men of his city in
the cemetery of St. John.

The domestic life of the old Nürnbergers seems to have been characterised by honourable simplicity,
and their posterity appear to follow laudably in their footsteps. They delight in the antiquity
of their city, and reverently preserve the relics of their past glories. Their houses seem
built for a past generation, their public edifices for the Middle Ages; their galleries abound
in the art of the fifteenth century, and admit nothing more modern than the seventeenth. In
the old garden upon the castle bastion is a quaint quadrangular tower[250-*] having its entrance
therefrom, and this has been fitted up with antique furniture, to give a true idea of the indoor
life of Dürer’s days. It contains a hall hung with tapestries, from which a staircase leads
to a suite of rooms, one fitted as a kitchen, another as a music-room, filled with the most
quaint and curious antique instruments, which have ceased “discoursing most eloquent music”
for the last two hundred years. The third room (a view of which we engrave) is a boudoir, containing
the large antique German stove, built up with ornamental tiles cast in relief, with stories
from bible history of saints, and arabesque. Beside it is a bronze receptacle for water, shaped
like a huge acorn, the tap having a grotesque head, and the spigot being a small seated figure;
this was gently turned when wanted, and a thin stream of water trickled over the hands into
the basin beneath; an embroidered napkin hangs beside it; and above it is the old-fashioned
set of four hour-glasses, so graduated that each ran out a quarter of an hour after the other.
The furniture and fittings of the entire building are all equally curious, and reproduce a
faithful picture of old times, worthy of being copied in National Museums elsewhere.

Nürnberg being a “free city” was governed by its own appointed magistrates, having independent
courts of law. The executive council of state consisted of eight members, chosen from the thirty
patrician families who, by the privilege granted to them from the thirteenth century, ruled
the city entirely. In process of time these privileges assumed the form of a civic tyranny,
which was felt to be intolerable by the people, and occasionally opposed by them. The fierce
religious wars of the sixteenth century assisted in destroying this monopoly of power still
more; yet now that it is gone for ever, it has left fearful traces of its irresponsible strength.
All who sigh for “the good old times,” should not moralise over the fallen greatness of the
city, and its almost deserted but noble town-hall; but descend below the building into the
dark vaults and corridors which form its basement; the terrible substructure upon which the
glorious municipal palace of a free imperial self-ruled city was based in the Middle Ages,
into whose secrets none dared pry, and where friends, hope, life itself, were lost to those
who dared revolt against the rulers. There is no romance-writer who has imagined more horrors
than we have evidences were perpetrated under the name of justice in these frightful vaults,
unknown to the busy citizens around them, within a few feet of the streets down which a gay
wedding procession might pass, while a true patriot was torn in every limb, and racked to death
by the refined cruelty of his fellow-men. The heart sickens in these vaults, and an instinctive
desire to quit them takes possession of the mind, while remaining merely as a curious spectator
within them. The narrow steps leading to them are reached through a decorated doorway, and
the passage below receives light through a series of gratings. You shortly reach the labyrinthine
ways, totally excluded from external light and air, and enter one after another confined dungeons,
little more than six feet square, cased with oak to deaden sounds, and to increase the difficulty
of attempted escape. To make these narrow places even more horrible, strong wooden stocks are
in some, and day and night prisoners were secured in total darkness, in an atmosphere which
even now seems too oppressive to bear. In close proximity to these dungeons is a strong stone
room, about twelve feet wide each way, into which you descend by three steps. It is the torture-chamber.
The massive bars before you are all that remain of the perpendicular rack, upon which unfortunates
were hung with weights attached to their ankles. Two such of stone, weighing each fifty pounds,
were kept here some years back, as well as many other implements of torture since removed or
sold for old iron. The raised stone bench around the room was for the use of the executioner
and attendants. The vaulted roof condensed the voice of the tortured man, and an aperture on
one side gave it freedom to ascend into the room above, where the judicial listeners waited
for the faltering words which succeeded the agonising screams of their victim. So much we know
and still see, but worse horrors were dreamily spoken of by the old Nürnbergers; there was
a tradition of a certain something that not only destroyed life, but annihilated the body of
the person sacrificed. The tradition took a more definite form in the seventeenth century,
and the “kiss of the Virgin” expressed this punishment, and was believed to consist in a figure
of the Virgin, which clasped its victim in arms furnished with poignards, and then opening
them, dropped the body down a trap on a sort of cradle of swords, arranged so as to cut it
to pieces, a running stream below clearing all traces of it away.

and he was the initial conversation. It opened with folding doors,
closing again over the victim, and pressing a series of poignards into the body, two being
affixed to the front of the face, to penetrate to the brain through the eyes. “That this machine
had formerly been used cannot be doubted; because there are evident blood-stains yet visible
on its breast and part of the pedestal.” This machine was introduced to Nürnberg in 1533, and
is believed to have originated in Spain, and to have been transplanted into Germany during
the reign of Charles V., who was monarch of both countries. At this period there were great
tumults in Germany and continual quarrels at Nürnberg between the Catholics and Protestants:
the men of that city had no doubt to thank “the most holy Inquisition” for this importation
of horrors.

The great leading principles of the Reformation interested Dürer as they did other thinking
men. He examined by the biblical test the unwholesome power and pretensions of the papacy,
and found it wanting. We have already noted the exhortation to abide by “the written word”
which he appended to his famous picture of the Apostles. In his journal he breaks forth into
uncontrolled lamentations over the crafty capture of Luther made by his friend the Elector
of Saxony, who conveyed him thus out of harm’s way, and kept him nearly a twelvemonth in the
Wartburg. He exclaims, “And is Luther dead? who will now explain the Gospel so clearly to us?
Aid me, all pious Christians, to bewail this man of heavenly mind, and pray God for some other
as divinely enlightened.” He then exhorts Erasmus to “come forth, defend the truth, and deserve
the martyr’s crown, for thou art already an old man.” Dürer had painted Erasmus’s portrait
at Brussels in 1520, and appears to have been intimate with that great man as he was with Melancthon,
who said of Dürer, that “his least merit was that of his art.”

Amid the strong dissensions of the Reformation, at a time when old Nürnberg was tottering to
its fall, worn down by mental toil, and withered at heart by one of the worst wives on record,
died Albert Dürer at the age of fifty-seven.

In the old cemetery of St. John lies all that is mortal of the artist who has given lasting
celebrity to Nürnberg. Let us take a walk in that direction. Passing out of the town by the
gate opposite Dürer’s house, the sculptured representations of the scenes of Christ’s Passion,
by Adam Krafft, already alluded to, will guide our footsteps on our way. About three-quarters
of a mile from the town, we reach the gate beside which stands Krafft’s group of the Crucifixion.[257-*]
We enter, and stand in a graveyard thickly covered with gravestones. Here the burgher aristocracy
of Nürnberg have been buried for centuries.

The heavy slabs which cover the graves are in many instances highly enriched by bronze plates
elaborately executed, containing coats of arms, emblems, or full-length figures. Each grave
is numbered, and that of Dürer is marked 649. The stone had fallen into decay, when Sandrart
the painter had it renewed in 1681.[258-*] This honourable act of love from a living artist
to a dead brother, enabled the memorial to stand another century of time. The artists of Nürnberg
now look after its conservation; it has recently been repaired by them, and on the anniversary
of the Spring morning when the great master departed, they reverently visit his resting-place.
The inscription upon it runs thus:--

  ME. AL. DU.
  QUICQUID ALBERTI DURERI MORTALE
  FVIT SUB HOC CONDITUR TUMULO.
  EMIGRAVIT. VIII. IDUS. APRILIS
  M.D.XXVIII. If it has “called up forgotten glories,” it has not been
a labour ill-bestowed. If it should induce others to leave England for
Nürnberg, as the writer hereof was induced, he can venture to predict
full satisfaction from the journey. Any one who may ramble through its
streets, know its past history, feel its poetic associations, like the
American bard we have just quoted, will say, as he has done, of old
Nürnberg and the great and good Albert Dürer--

    “Fairer seems the ancient city, and the sunshine seems more fair,
    That he once has trod its pavement, that he once has breathed its air!”

see the Art-Journal for 1851, pp. 141-144 and pp. 193-196. See also, “Vignettes d’Albert Dürer,”
par George Franz.

[223-*] These incipient bastions and horn-works may be seen in our cut, p. 194.

[223-†] Marc Antonio had copied Dürer’s cuts on copper, but they are poor substitutes for the
originals. They, however, did Dürer an injury of which he complained.

[227-†] Mrs. Jameson speaks of his portrait as “beautiful, like the old heads of our Saviour;
and the predominant expression is calm, dignified, intellectual, with a tinge of melancholy.
This picture was painted at the age of twenty-eight; he was then suffering from that bitter
domestic curse, a shrewish, avaricious wife, who finally broke his heart.” We have engraved
this portrait in the head-piece to this subject (p. 187), along with those of his wife and
of his friend Pirkheimer.

[228-*] Leopold Schefer has constructed a novelette on his domestic career, which has been
cleverly translated by Mrs. Stodart. It is entitled “The Artist’s Married Life, being that
of Albert Dürer.” It teaches much by its pure philosophy.

[229-*] They are now in the Pinacothek at Munich.

[229-†] Dürer had warmly espoused the Reformation, and had placed quotations from the gospels
and epistles of the Apostles beneath each picture, containing pressing warnings not to swerve
from the written word, or listen to false prophets and perverters of the truth. When the town
presented these pictures to the Roman Catholic Elector Maximilian I., of Bavaria, in 1627,
they cut off these inscriptions, and affixed them to the copies they had made for themselves
by Vischer, and which are now in the Landauer Gallery at Nürnberg.

[230-*] There is an old tradition that Dürer intended these figures also as embodiments of
the four mental temperaments--John, representing the melancholic; Peter, the meditative, or
phlegmatic; Mark, the sanguine; and Paul, the resolute or choleric.

[231-*] Kügler. Mrs. Jameson, in her “Visits at Home and Abroad,” also speaks of them as “wonderful!
In expression, in calm religious majesty, in suavity of pencilling, and the grand, pure style
of the heads and drapery, quite like Raffaelle.”

[231-†] Among the rest is the very marvellous one performed during a journey in winter, when
he was nearly destroyed by cold, and entered a peasant’s cottage, hoping to find relief. The
poor man had no fuel, so the saint made up a fire from the icicles which hung around the house,
completing his good acts by mending his broken kettle, “by blessing it, at the request of his
host,” and converting stones into bread by the same simple process.

[234-*] Vischer’s house is situated on the other side of the River Pegnitz, which divides the
town; it is in a steep street rising suddenly from the water. The house has undergone some
alterations in its external aspect, apparently about the latter half of the seventeenth century.
It is now a baker’s shop, having that quiet aspect which characterises such trades in Germany,
the central window on the ground-floor being that through which bread is passed to applicants,
who may mount the steps in front, or rest on them while waiting. Von retrieve well what would to
have been his relation, as he sat on enough cellar steps and pegged again been with his aid-barong.
It took him was no piece was to get the touch, to clip off contemplating
the brink of a shrapnel, to the into the bivalve without the injury
to pry morsel within himself, and we may thus of slip it into the sn
pail at hand.

He get the inspiration in the thenar as he did it, but he conceived
it down with his handkerchief, finished evaluation, and conceived
the male for his banquet.

Then he had to give their experience as he could not get it in much
cellar, but he stowed off a in satisfy him of he are here started
ourselves on his travels.

[245-*] The crown and royal robes of Charlemagne were those found in his tomb at Aix-la-Chapelle,
afterwards used in the coronation of the German emperors for many centuries, and only transferred
to Vienna during the great political changes of the last century. “The sacred relics” are also
at Vienna, and were among the most valued and venerated of church treasures. They also were
publicly exhibited at the coronations, and consisted of the lance which pierced the Saviour’s
side when upon the cross; a piece of the cross, showing the hole made by the nail which pierced
one of the Saviour’s hands; one of the nails; and five of the thorns of the crown put upon
his head by the soldiers; a portion of the manger of Bethlehem; a piece of the table-cloth
used at the Last Supper; and a piece of the towel with which Christ wiped the Apostles’ feet;
an arm-bone of St. Anne; a tooth of St. John the Baptist; a piece of the coat of St. John the
Evangelist; and three links of the chains which bound St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. John in
the Roman prison.

[250-*] It is seen in our view from Albert Dürer’s house, and is close beside the gate of the town.

[257-*] Our engraving (Fig. 257) is taken from a sketch made on this spot, looking back towards
the city, and its ancient castle on the rock. Krafft’s sculptures are seen to the left, at
intervals, on the road-side.

[258-*] He also is interred in this cemetery. So is Dürer’s friend, Pirkheimer; his grave is
No. 1414.
