CHAPTER I

THE GREAT ELIZABETHAN NAVIGATORS

The map of Canada offers to the eye and to the imagination a vast country more than three thousand
miles in width.  Its eastern face presents a broken outline to the wild surges of the Atlantic.
Its western coast commands from majestic heights the broad bosom of the Pacific.  Along its
southern boundary is a fertile country of lake and plain and woodland, loud already with the
murmur of a rising industry, and in summer waving with the golden wealth of the harvest.

But on its northern side Canada is set fast against the frozen seas of the Pole and the desolate
region of barren rock and ice-bound island that is joined to the polar ocean by a common mantle
of snow.  For hundreds and hundreds of miles the vast fortress of ice rears its battlements
of shining glaciers.  The unending sunshine of the Arctic summer falls upon untrodden snow.
The cold light of the {2} aurora illumines in winter an endless desolation.  There is no sound,
save when at times the melting water falls from the glistening sides of some vast pinnacle
of ice, or when the leaden sea forces its tide between the rock-bound islands.  Here in this
vast territory civilization has no part and man no place.  Life struggles northward only to
die out in the Arctic cold.  The green woods of the lake district and the blossoms of the prairies
are left behind.  The fertility of the Great West gives place to the rock-strewn wilderness
of the barren grounds.  A stunted and deformed vegetation fights its way to the Arctic Circle.
Rude grasses and thin moss cling desperately to the naked rock.  Animal life pushes even farther.
The seas of the frozen ocean still afford a sustenance.  Even mankind is found eking out a
savage livelihood on the shores of the northern sea.  But gradually all fades, until nothing
is left but the endless plain of snow, stretching towards the Pole.

Yet this frozen northern land and these forbidding seas have their history.  Deeds were here
done as great in valour as those which led to the conquest of a Mexico or the acquisition of
a Peru.  But unlike the captains and conquerors of the South, the explorers have {3} come and
gone and left behind no trace of their passage.  Their hopes of a land of gold, their vision
of a new sea-way round the world, are among the forgotten dreams of the past.  Robbed of its
empty secret, the North still stretches silent and untenanted with nothing but the splendid
record of human courage to illuminate its annals.

For us in our own day, the romance that once clung about the northern seas has drifted well
nigh to oblivion.  To understand it we must turn back in fancy three hundred years.  We must
picture to ourselves the aspect of the New World at the time when Elizabeth sat on the throne
of England, and when the kingdoms of western Europe, Britain, France, and Spain, were rising
from the confusion of the Middle Ages to national greatness.  The existence of the New World
had been known for nearly a hundred years.  But it still remained shadowed in mystery and uncertainty.
It was known that America lay as a vast continent, or island, as men often called it then,
midway between Europe and the great empires of the East.  Columbus, and after him Verrazano
and others, had explored its eastern coast, finding everywhere a land of dense forests, peopled
here and there with naked savages that fled at their {4} approach.  The servants of the king
of Spain had penetrated its central part and reaped, in the spoils of Mexico, the reward of
their savage bravery.  From the central isthmus Balboa had first seen the broad expanse of
the Pacific.  On this ocean the Spaniard Pizarro had been borne to the conquest of Peru.  Even
before that conquest Magellan had passed the strait that bears his name, and had sailed westward
from America over the vast space that led to the island archipelago of Eastern Asia.  Far towards
the northern end of the great island, the fishermen of the Channel ports had found their way
in yearly sailings to the cod banks of Newfoundland.  There they had witnessed the silent procession
of the great icebergs that swept out of the frozen seas of the north, and spoke of oceans still
unknown, leading one knew not whither.  The boldest of such sailors, one Jacques Cartier, fighting
his way westward had entered a great gulf that yawned in the opening side of the continent,
and from it he had advanced up a vast river, the like of which no man had seen.  Hundreds of
miles from the gulf he had found villages of savages, who pointed still westward and told him
of wonderful countries of gold and silver that lay beyond the palisaded settlement of Hochelaga.

{5}

But the discoveries of Columbus and those who followed him had not solved but had only opened
the mystery of the western seas.  True, a way to the Asiatic empire had been found.  The road
discovered by the Portuguese round the base of Africa was known.  But it was long and arduous
beyond description.  Even more arduous was the sea-way found by Magellan: the whole side of
the continent must be traversed.  The dreadful terrors of the straits that separate South America
from the Land of Fire must be essayed: and beyond that a voyage of thirteen thousand miles
across the Pacific, during which the little caravels must slowly make their way northward again
till the latitude of Cathay was reached, parallel to that of Spain itself.  For any other sea-way
to Asia the known coast-line of America offered an impassable barrier. In only one region,
and that as yet unknown, might an easier and more direct way be found towards the eastern empires.
This was by way of the northern seas, either round the top of Asia or, more direct still perhaps,
by entering those ice-bound seas that lay beyond the Great Banks of Newfoundland and the coastal
waters visited by Jacques Cartier.  Into the entrance of these waters the ships of the Cabots
flying the {6} English flag had already made their way at the close of the fifteenth century.
They seem to have reached as far, or nearly as far, as the northern limits of Labrador, and
Sebastian Cabot had said that beyond the point reached by their ships the sea opened out before
them to the west.  No further exploration was made, indeed, for three-quarters of a century
after the Cabots, but from this time on the idea of a North-West Passage and the possibility
of a great achievement in this direction remained as a tradition with English seamen.

It was natural, then, that the English sailors of the sixteenth century should turn to the
northern seas.  The eastern passage, from the German Ocean round the top of Russia and Asia,
was first attempted.  As early as the reign of Edward the Sixth, a company of adventurers,
commonly called the Muscovy Company, sailed their ships round the north of Norway and opened
a connection with Russia by way of the White Sea. But the sailing masters of the company tried
in vain to find a passage in this direction to the east.  Their ships reached as far as the
Kara Sea at about the point where the present boundary of European Russia separates it from
Siberia.  Beyond this extended countless leagues of {7} impassable ice and the rock-bound desolation
of Northern Asia.

It remained to seek a passage in the opposite direction by way of the Arctic seas that lay
above America.  To find such a passage and with it a ready access to Cathay and the Indies
became one of the great ambitions of the Elizabethan age.  There is no period when great things
might better have been attempted.  It was an epoch of wonderful national activity and progress:
the spirit of the nation was being formed anew in the Protestant Reformation and in the rising
conflict with Spain.  It was the age of Drake, of Raleigh, of Shakespeare, the time at which
were aroused those wide ambitions which were to give birth to the British Empire.

In thinking of the exploits of these Elizabethan sailors in the Arctic seas, we must try to
place ourselves at their point of view, and dismiss from our minds our own knowledge of the
desolate and hopeless region against which their efforts were directed.  The existence of Greenland,
often called Frisland, and of Labrador was known from the voyages of the Cabots and the Corte-Reals.
It was known that between these two coasts the sea swept in a powerful current out of the north.
Of {8} what lay beyond nothing was known.  There seemed no reason why Frobisher, or Davis,
or Henry Hudson might not find the land trend away to the south again and thus offer, after
a brief transit of the dangerous waters of the north, a smooth and easy passage over the Pacific.

Perhaps we can best understand the hopes and ambitions of the time if we turn to the writings
of the Elizabethans themselves.  One of the greatest of them, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, afterwards
lost in the northern seas, wrote down at large his reasons for believing that the passage was
feasible and that its discovery would be fraught with the greatest profit to the nation.  In
his Discourse to prove a North-West Passage to Cathay, Gilbert argues that all writers from
Plato down have spoken of a great island out in the Atlantic; that this island is America which
must thus have a water passage all round it; that the ocean currents moving to the west across
the Atlantic and driven along its coast, as Cartier saw, past Newfoundland, evidently show
that the water runs on round the top of America.  A North-West Passage must therefore exist.
Of the advantages to be derived from its discovery Gilbert was in no doubt.

{9}

It were the only way for our princes [he wrote] to possess themselves of the wealth of all
the east parts of the world which is infinite. Through the shortness of the voyage, we should
be able to sell all manner of merchandise brought from thence far better cheap than either
the Portugal or Spaniard doth or may do.  Also we might sail to divers very rich countries,
both civil and others, out of both their jurisdiction [that of the Portuguese and Spaniards],
where there is to be found great abundance of gold, silver, precious stones, cloth of gold,
silks, all manner of spices, grocery wares, and other kinds of merchandise of an inestimable price.

Gilbert also speaks of the possibility of colonizing the regions thus to be discovered.  The
quaint language in which he describes the chances of what is now called 'imperial expansion'
is not without its irony:

We might inhabit some part of those countries [he says], and settle there such needy people
of our country which now trouble the commonwealth, and through want here at home are enforced
to commit {10} outrageous offences whereby they are daily consumed with the gallows. We shall
also have occasion to set poor men's children to learn handicrafts and thereby to make trifles
and such like, which the Indians and those people do much esteem: by reason whereof there should
be none occasion to have our country cumbered with loiterers, vagabonds, and such like idle
persons.

Undoubtedly Gilbert's way of thinking was also that of many of the great statesmen and sailors
of his day.  Especially was this the case with Sir Martin Frobisher, a man, we are told, 'thoroughly
furnished with knowledge of the sphere and all other skills appertaining to the art of navigation.'
The North-West Passage became the dream of Frobisher's ambition.  Year after year he vainly
besought the queen's councillors to sanction an expedition.  But the opposition of the powerful
Muscovy Company was thrown against the project.  Frobisher, although supported by the influence
of the Earl of Warwick, agitated and argued in vain for fifteen years, till at last in 1574
the necessary licence was granted and the countenance of the queen was assured to the enterprise.
Even then about two years {11} passed before the preparations could be completed.

Frobisher's first expedition was on a humble scale.  His company numbered in all thirty-five
men.  They embarked in two small barques, the Gabriel and the Michael, neither of them of more
than twenty-five tons, and a pinnace of ten tons.  They carried food for a year.  The ships
dropped down the Thames on June 7, 1576, and as they passed Greenwich, where the queen's court
was, the little vessels made a brave show by the discharge of their ordnance.  Elizabeth waved
her hand from a window to the departing ships and sent one of her gentlemen aboard to say that
she had 'a good liking of their doings.'  From such small acts of royal graciousness has often
sprung a wonderful devotion.

Frobisher's little ships struck boldly out on the Atlantic.  They ran northward first, and
crossed the ocean along the parallel of sixty degrees north latitude.  Favourable winds and
strong gales bore them rapidly across the sea.  On July 11, they sighted the southern capes
of Greenland, or Frisland, as they called it, that rose like pinnacles of steeples, snow-crowned
and glittering on the horizon.  They essayed a landing, but the masses of shore ice and the
{12} drifting fog baffled their efforts.  Here off Cape Desolation the full fury of the Arctic
gales broke upon their ships.  The little pinnace foundered with all hands.  The Michael was
separated from her consort in the storm, and her captain, losing heart, made his way back to
England to report Frobisher cast away.  But no terror of the sea could force Frobisher from
his purpose.  With his single ship the Gabriel, its mast sprung, its top-mast carried overboard
in the storm, he drove on towards the west.  He was 'determined,' so writes a chronicler of
his voyages, 'to bring true proof of what land and sea might be so far to the northwestwards
beyond any that man hath heretofore discovered.'  His efforts were rewarded.  On July 28, a
tall headland rose on the horizon, Queen Elizabeth's Foreland, so Frobisher named it.  As the
Gabriel approached, a deep sound studded with rocky islands at its mouth opened to view.  Its
position shows that the vessel had been carried northward and westward past the coast of Labrador
and the entrance of Hudson Strait.  The voyagers had found their way to the vast polar island
now known as Baffin Island.  Into this, at the point which the ship had reached, there extends
a deep inlet, {13} called after its discoverer, Frobisher's Strait.  Frobisher had found a
new land, and its form, with a great sea passage running westward and land both north and south
of it, made him think that this was truly the highway to the Orient.  He judged that the land
seen to the north was part of Asia, reaching out and overlapping the American continent.  For
many days heavy weather and fog and the danger of the drifting ice prevented a landing.  The
month of August opened with calm seas and milder weather.  Frobisher and his men were able
to land in the ship's boat.  They found before them a desolate and uninviting prospect, a rock-bound
coast fringed with islands and with the huge masses of grounded icebergs.

For nearly a month Frobisher's ship stood on and off the coast.  Fresh water was taken on board.
In a convenient spot the ship was beached and at low tide repairs were made and leaks were
stopped in the strained timbers of her hull.  In the third week, canoes of savages were seen,
and presently the natives were induced to come on board the Gabriel and barter furs for looking-glasses
and trinkets.  The savages were 'like Tartars with long black hair, broad faces, and flat noses.'
They seemed friendly and well-disposed.  Five of the English {14} sailors ventured to join
the natives on land, contrary to the express orders of the captain.  They never returned, nor
could any of the savages be afterwards induced to come within reach.  One man only, paddling
in the sea in his skin canoe, was enticed to the ship's side by the tinkling of a little bell,
and so seized and carried away.  But his own sailors, though he vainly searched the coast,
Frobisher saw no more.  After a week's delay, the Gabriel set sail (on August 26) for home,
and in spite of terrific gales was safely back at her anchorage at Harwich early in October.

Contrary to what we should suppose, the voyage was viewed as a brilliant success.  The queen
herself named the newly found rocks and islands Meta Incognita.  Frobisher was at once 'specially
famous for the great hope he brought of a passage to Cathay.'  A strange-looking piece of black
rock that had been carried home in the Gabriel was pronounced by a metallurgist, one Baptista
Agnello, to contain gold; true, Agnello admitted in confidence that he had 'coaxed nature'
to find the precious metal.  But the rumour of the thing was enough.  The cupidity of the London
merchants was added to the ambitions of the court.  There was no trouble about finding {15}
ships and immediate funds for a second expedition.

The new enterprise was carried out in the following year (1577).  The Gabriel and the Michael
sailed again, and with them one of the queen's ships, the Aid.  This time the company included
a number of soldiers and gentlemen adventurers.  The main object was not the discovery of the
passage but the search for gold.

The expedition sailed out of Harwich on May 31, 1577, following the route by the north of Scotland.
A week's sail brought the ships 'with a merrie wind' to the Orkneys.  Here a day or so was
spent in obtaining water.  The inhabitants of these remote islands were found living in stone
huts in a condition almost as primitive as that of American savages.  'The good man, wife,
children, and other members of the family,' wrote Master Settle, one of Frobisher's company,
'eat and sleep on one side of the house and the cattle on the other, very beastly and rude.'
From the Orkneys the ships pursued a very northerly course, entering within the Arctic Circle
and sailing in the perpetual sunlight of the polar day.  Near Iceland they saw huge pine trees
drifting, roots and all, across the ocean.  Wild storms {16} beset them as they passed the
desolate capes of Greenland.  At length, on July 16, the navigators found themselves off the
headlands of Meta Incognita.

Here Frobisher and his men spent the summer.  The coast and waters were searched as far as
the inclement climate allowed.  The savages were fierce and unfriendly.  A few poor rags of
clothing found among the rocks bespoke the fate of the sailors of the year before.  Fierce
conflicts with the natives followed.  Several were captured.  One woman so hideous and wrinkled
with age that the mariners thought her a witch was released in pious awe.  A younger woman,
with a baby at her back, was carried captive to the English ships.  The natives in return watched
their opportunity and fell fiercely on the English as occasion offered, leaping headlong from
the rocks into the sea rather than submit to capture.

To the perils of conflict was added the perpetual danger of moving ice. Even in the summer
seas, great gales blew and giant masses of ice drove furiously through the strait.  No passage
was possible.  In vain Frobisher landed on both the northern and the southern sides and tried
to penetrate the rugged country.  All about the land was barren and forbidding.  {17} Mountains
of rough stone crowned with snow blocked the way.  No trees were seen and no vegetation except
a scant grass here and there upon the flatter spaces of the rocks.

But neither the terrors of the ice nor the fear of the savages could damp the ardour of the
explorers.  The landing of Frobisher and his men on Meta Incognita was carried out with something
of the pomp, dear to an age of chivalrous display, that marked the landing of Columbus on the
tropic island of San Salvador.  The captain and his men moved in marching order: they knelt
together on the barren rock to offer thanks to God and to invoke a blessing on their queen.
Great cairns of stone were piled high here and there, as a sign of England's sovereignty, while
as they advanced against the rugged hills of the interior, the banner of their country was
proudly carried in the van.  Their thoughts were not of glory only.  It was with the ardour
of treasure-seekers that they fell to their task, forgetting in the lust for gold the chill
horror of their surroundings; and, when the Arctic sunlight glittered on the splintered edges
of the rocks, the crevices of the barren stone seemed to the excited minds of the explorers
to be filled with virgin gold, carried by subterranean {18} streams.  The three ships were
loaded deep with worthless stone, a fitting irony on their quest. Then, at the end of August,
they were turned again eastward for England.  Tempest and fog enveloped their passage.  The
ships were driven asunder.  Each thought the others lost.  But, by good fortune, all safely
arrived, the captain's ship landing at Milford Haven, the others at Bristol and Yarmouth.

Fortunately for Frobisher the worthless character of the freight that he brought home was not
readily made clear by the crude methods of the day.  For the next summer found him again off
the shores of Meta Incognita eagerly searching for new mines.  This time he bore with him a
large company and ample equipment.  Fifteen ships in all sailed under his command.  Among his
company were miners and artificers.  The frames of a house, ready to set up, were borne in
the vessels.  Felton, a ship's captain, and a group of Frobisher's gentlemen were to be left
behind to spend the winter in the new land.

From the first the voyage was inauspicious.  The ships had scarcely entered the straits before
a great storm broke upon them.  Land and sea were blotted out in driving snow.  The open water
into which they had sailed was soon {19} filled with great masses of ice which the tempest
cast furiously against the ships.  To their horror the barque Dionise, rammed by the ice, went
down in the swirling waters.  With her she carried all her cargo, including a part of the timbers
of the house destined for the winter's habitation.  But the stout courage of the mariners was
undismayed.  All through the evening and the night they fought against the ice: with capstan
bars, with boats' oars, and with great planks they thrust it from the ships.  Some of the men
leaped down upon the moving floes and bore with might and main against the ships to break the
shock.  At times the little vessels were lifted clear out of the sea, their sides torn with
the fierce blows of the ice-pack, their seams strained and leaking.  All night they looked
for instant death.  But, with the coming of the morning, the wind shifted to the west and cleared
the ice from the sea, and God sent to the mariners, so runs their chronicle, 'so pleasant a
day as the like we had not of a long time before, as after punishment consolation.'

But their dangers were not ended.  As the ships stood on and off the land, they fell in with
a great berg of ice that reared its height four hundred feet above the masts, and lay {20}
extended for a half mile in length.  This they avoided.  But a few days later, while they were
still awaiting a landing, a great mist rolled down upon the seas, so that for five days and
nights all was obscurity and no ship could see its consorts.  Current and tide drove the explorers
to and fro till they drifted away from the mouth of Frobisher Strait southward and westward.
Then another great sound opened before them to the west. This was the passage of Hudson Strait,
and, had Frobisher followed it, he would have found the vast inland sea of Hudson Bay open
to his exploration.  But, intent upon his search for ore, he fought his way back to the inhospitable
waters that bear his name.  There at an island which had been christened the Countess of Warwick's
Island, the fleet was able to assemble by August 1.  But the ill-fortune of the enterprise
demanded the abandonment of all idea of settlement. Frobisher and his men made haste to load
their vessels with the worthless rock which abounded in the district.  In one 'great black
island alone' there was discovered such a quantity of it that 'if the goodness might answer
the plenty thereof, it might reasonably suffice all the gold-gluttons of the world.'  In leaving
Meta Incognita, Frobisher and his {21} companions by no means intended that the enterprise
should be definitely abandoned.  Such timbers of the house as remained they buried for use
next year.  A little building, or fort, of stone was erected, to test whether it would stand
against the frost of the Arctic winter.  In it were set a number of little toys, bells, and
knives to tempt the cupidity of the Eskimos, who had grown wary and hostile to the newcomers.
Pease, corn, and grain were sown in the scant soil as a provision for the following summer.
On the last day of August, the fleet departed on its homeward voyage.  The passage was long
and stormy.  The ships were scattered and found their way home as best they might, some to
one harbour and some to another.  But by the beginning of October, the entire fleet was safely
back in its own waters.

The expectations of a speedy return to Meta Incognita were doomed to disappointment.  The ore
that the ships carried proved to be but worthless rock, and from the commercial point of view
the whole expedition was a failure.  Frobisher was never able to repeat his attempt to find
the North-West Passage.  In its existence his faith remained as firm as ever.  But, although
his three voyages resulted in no discoveries of {22} profit to England, his name should stand
high on the roll of honour of great English sea-captains.  He brought to bear on his task not
only the splendid courage of his age, but also the earnest devotion and intense religious spirit
which marked the best men of the period of the Reformation.  The first article of Frobisher's
standing orders to his fleet enjoined his men to banish swearing, dice, and card-playing and
to worship God twice a day in the service of the Church of England.  The watchword of the fleet,
to be called out in fog or darkness as a means of recognition was 'Before the World was God,'
and the answer shouted back across the darkness, 'After God came Christ His Son.'  At all convenient
times and places, sermons were preached to the company of the fleet by Frobisher's chaplain,
Master Wolfall, a godly man who had left behind in England a 'large living and a good honest
woman to wife and very towardly children,' in order to spread the Gospel in the new land. 
Frobisher's personal bravery was of the highest order.  We read how in the rage of a storm
he would venture tasks from which even his boldest sailors shrank in fear.  Once, when his
ship was thrown on her beam ends and the water poured into the waist, the commander worked
his way along {23} the lee side of the vessel, engulfed in the roaring surges, to free the
sheets.  With these qualities Martin Frobisher combined a singular humanity towards both those
whom he commanded and natives with whom he dealt.  It is to be regretted that a man of such
high character and ability should have spent his efforts on so vain a task.

Although the gold mines of Meta Incognita had become discredited, it was not long before hope
began to revive in the hearts of the English merchants.  The new country produced at least
valuable sealskins. There was always the chance, too, that a lucky discovery of a Western Passage
might bring fabulous wealth to the merchant adventurers.  It thus happened that not many years
elapsed before certain wealthy men of London and the West Country, especially one Master William
Sanderson, backed by various gentlemen of the court, decided to make another venture.  They
chose as their captain and chief pilot John Davis, who had already acquired a reputation as
a bold and skilful mariner.  In 1585 Davis, in command of two little ships, the Sunshine and
the Moonshine, set out from Dartmouth.  The memory of this explorer will always be associated
with the great {24} strait or arm of the sea which separates Greenland from the Arctic islands
of Canada, and which bears his name.  To these waters, his three successive voyages were directed,
and he has the honour of being the first on the long roll of navigators whose watchword has
been 'Farther North,' and who have carried their ships nearer and nearer to the pole.

Davis started by way of the English Channel and lay storm-bound for twelve days under the Scilly
Islands, a circumstance which bears witness to the imperfect means of navigation of the day
and to the courage of seamen.  The ships once able to put to sea, the voyage was rapid, and
in twenty days Davis was off the south-west coast of Greenland.  All about the ships were fog
and mist, and a great roaring noise which the sailors thought must be the sea breaking on a
beach. They lay thus for a day, trying in vain for soundings and firing guns in order to know
the whereabouts of the ships.  They lowered their boats and found that the roaring noise came
from the grinding of the ice pack that lay all about them.  Next day the fog cleared and revealed
the coast, which they said was the most deformed rocky and mountainous land that ever they
saw.  This was Greenland.  The commander, {25} suiting a name to the miserable prospect before
him, called it the Land of Desolation.

Davis spent nearly a fortnight on the coast.  There was little in the inhospitable country
to encourage his exploration.  Great cliffs were seen glittering as with gold or crystal, but
the ore was the same as that which Frobisher had brought from Meta Incognita and the voyagers
had been warned.  Of vegetation there was nothing but scant grass and birch and willow growing
like stunted shrubs close to the ground. Eskimos were seen plying along the coast in their
canoes of seal skin. They called to the English sailors in a deep guttural speech, low in the
throat, of which nothing was intelligible.  One of them pointed upwards to the sun and beat
upon his breast.  By imitating this gesture, which seemed a pledge of friendship, the sailors
were able to induce the natives to approach.  They presently mingled freely with Davis's company.
The captain shook hands with all who came to him, and there was a great show of friendliness
on both sides.  A brisk trade began.  The savages eagerly handed over their garments of sealskin
and fur, their darts, oars, and everything that they had, in return for little trifles, even
for pieces of paper.  They seemed to the English sailors a very tractable {26} people, void
of craft and double dealing. Seeing that the English were eager to obtain furs, they pointed
to the hills inland, as if to indicate that they should go and bring a large supply.  But Davis
was anxious for further exploration, and would not delay his ships.  On August 1, the wind
being fair, he put to sea, directing his course to the north-west.  In five days he reached
the land on the other side of Davis Strait.  This was the shore of what is now called Baffin
Island, in latitude 66° 40', and hence considerably to the north of the strait which Frobisher
had entered.  At this season the sea was clear of ice, and Davis anchored his ships under a
great cliff that glittered like gold.  He called it Mount Raleigh, and the sound which opened
out beside it Exeter Sound.  A large headland to the south was named Cape Walsingham in honour
of the queen's secretary. Davis and his men went ashore under Mount Raleigh, where they saw
four white bears of 'a monstrous bigness,' three of which they killed with their guns and boar-spears.
There were low shrubs growing among the cliffs and flowers like primroses.  But the whole country
as far as they could see was without wood or grass.  Nothing was in sight except the open iceless
sea to the east and on the land side {27} great mountains of stone.  Though the land offered
nothing to their search, the air was moderate and the weather singularly mild.  The broad sheet
of open water, of the very colour of the ocean itself, buoyed up their hopes of the discovery
of the Western Passage.  Davis turned his ships to the south, coasting the shore.  Here and
there signs of man were seen, a pile of stones fashioned into a rude wall and a human skull
lying upon the rock.  The howling of wolves, as the sailors thought it, was heard along the
shore; but when two of these animals were killed they were seen to be dogs like mastiffs with
sharp ears and bushy tails.  A little farther on sleds were found, one made of wood and sawn
boards, the other of whalebone.  Presently the coast-line was broken into a network of barren
islands with great sounds between.  When Davis sailed southward he reached and passed the strait
that had been the scene of Frobisher's adventures and, like Frobisher himself, also passed
by the opening of Hudson Strait.  Davis was convinced that somewhere on this route was the
passage that he sought.  But the winds blew hard from the west, rendering it difficult to prosecute
his search.  The short season was already closing in, and it was dangerous to {28} linger.
Reluctantly the ships were turned homeward, and, though separated at sea, the Sunshine and
the Moonshine arrived safely at Dartmouth within two hours of each other.

While this first expedition had met with no conspicuous material success, Davis was yet able
to make two other voyages to the same region in the two following seasons.  In his second voyage,
that of 1586, he sailed along the edge of the continent from above the Arctic Circle to the
coast of Labrador, a distance of several hundred miles. His search convinced him that if a
passage existed at all it must lie somewhere among the great sounds that opened into the coast,
one of which, of course, proved later on to be the entrance to Hudson Bay. Moreover, Davis
began to see that, owing to the great quantity of whales in the northern waters, and the ease
with which seal-skins and furs could be bought from the natives, these ventures might be made
a source of profit whether the Western Passage was found or not.  In his second voyage alone
he bought from the Eskimos five hundred sealskins. The natives seem especially to have interested
him, and he himself wrote an account of his dealings with them.  They were found to be people
of good stature, well proportioned in body, {29} with broad faces and small eyes, wide mouths,
for the most part unbearded, and with great lips.  They were, so Davis said, 'very simple in
their conversation, but marvellous thievish.'  They made off with a boat that lay astern of
the Moonshine, cut off pieces from clothes that were spread out to dry, and stole oars, spears,
swords, and indeed anything within their reach.  Articles made of iron seemed to offer an irresistible
temptation: in spite of all pledges of friendship and of the lifting up of hands towards the
sun which the Eskimos renewed every morning, they no sooner saw iron than they must perforce
seize upon it. To stop their pilfering, Davis was compelled to fire off a cannon among them,
whereat the savages made off in wild terror.  But in a few hours they came flocking back again,
holding up their hands to the sun and begging to be friends.  'When I perceived this,' said
Davis, 'it did but minister unto me an occasion of laughter to see their simplicity and I willed
that in no case should they be any more hardly used, but that our own company should be more
vigilant to keep their things, supposing it to be very hard in so short a time to make them
know their own evils.'

The natives ate all their meat raw, lived {30} mostly on fish and 'ate grass and ice with delight.'
They were rarely out of the water, but lived in the nature of fishes except when 'dead sleep
took them,' and they lay down exhausted in a warm hollow of the rocks.  Davis found among them
copper ore and black and red copper.  But Frobisher's experience seems to have made him loath
to hunt for mineral treasure.

On his last voyage (1587) Davis made a desperate attempt to find the desired passage by striking
boldly towards the Far North.  He skirted the west shore of Greenland and with favourable winds
ran as far north as 72° 12', thus coming into the great sheet of polar water now called Baffin
Bay.  This was at the end of the month of June.  In these regions there was perpetual day,
the sun sweeping in a great circle about the heavens and standing five degrees above the horizon
even at midnight.  To the northward and westward, as far as could be seen, there was nothing
but open sea.  Davis thought himself almost in sight of the goal.  Then the wind turned and
blew fiercely out of the north. Unable to advance, Davis drove westward across the path of
the gale. At forty leagues from Greenland, he came upon a sheet of ice that forced him to turn
back {31} towards the south.  It seemed most manifest that the passage was free and without
impediment towards the north.'

When Davis returned home, he was still eager to try again.  But the situation was changed.
Walsingham, who had encouraged his enterprise, was dead, and the whole energy of the nation
was absorbed in the great struggle with Spain.  Davis sailed no more to the northern seas.
With each succeeding decade it became clear that the hopes aroused by the New World lay not
in finding a passage by the ice-blocked sounds of the north, but in occupying the vast continent
of America itself.  Many voyages were indeed attempted before the hope of a northern passage
to the Indies was laid aside.  Weymouth, Knight, and others followed in the track of Frobisher
and Davis.  But nothing new was found.  The sea-faring spirit and the restless adventure which
characterized the Elizabethan period outlived the great queen.  The famous voyage of Henry
Hudson in 1610 revealed the existence of the great inland sea which bears his name.  {32} Hudson,
already famous as an explorer and for his discovery of the Hudson river, was sent out by Sir
John Wolstenholme and Sir Dudley Digges to find the North-West Passage.  The story of his passage
of the strait, his discovery of the great bay, the mutiny of his men and his tragic and mysterious
fate forms one of the most thrilling narratives in the history of exploration.  But it belongs
rather to the romantic story of the great company whose corporate title recalls his name and
memory, than to the present narrative.

After Hudson came the exploits of Bylot, one of his pilots, and a survivor of the tragedy,
and of William Baffin, who tried to follow Davis's lead in searching for the Western Passage
in the very confines of the polar sea.  Finally there came (1631) the voyage of Captain Luke
Fox, who traversed the whole western coast of Hudson Bay and proved that from the main body
of its waters there was no outlet to the Pacific.  The hope of a North-West Passage in the
form of a wide and glittering sea, an easy passage to Asia, was dead.  Other causes were added
to divert attention from the northern waters.  The definite foundation of the colonies of Virginia
and Massachusetts Bay opened the path to new {33} hopes and even wider ambitions of Empire.
Then, as the seventeenth century moved on its course, the shadow of civil strife fell dark
over England.  The fierce struggle of the Great Rebellion ended for a time all adventure overseas.
When it had passed, the days of bold sea-farers gazing westward from the decks of their little
caravels over the glittering ice of the Arctic for a pathway to the Orient were gone, and the
first period of northern adventure had come to an end.

{34}

CHAPTER II

HEARNE'S OVERLAND JOURNEY TO THE NORTHERN OCEAN

In course of time the inaccurate knowledge and vague hopes of the early navigators were exchanged
for more definite ideas in regard to the American continent.  The progress of discovery along
the Pacific side of the continent and the occupation by the Spaniards of the coast of California
led to a truer conception of the immense breadth of North America.  Voyages across the Pacific
to the Philippines revealed the great distance to be traversed in order to reach the Orient
by the western route.  At the same time the voyages of Captain Fox and his contemporary Captain
James had proved Hudson Bay to be an enclosed sea. In consequence, for about a century no further
attempt was made to find a North-West Passage.

In the meantime the English came into connection with the Far North in a different way.  {35}
The early explorers had brought home the news of the extraordinary wealth of America in fur-bearing
animals.  Soon the fur trade became the most important feature of the settlements on the American
coast, and from both New England and New France enormous quantities of furs were exported to
Europe.  This commerce was with the Indians, and everything depended upon a ready and convenient
access to the interior.  Thus it came about that when the peculiar configuration of Hudson
Bay was known to combine an access to the remotest parts of the continent with a short sea
passage to Europe, its shores naturally offered themselves as the proper scene of the trade
in furs.  The great rivers that flowed into the bay--the Severn, the Nelson, the Albany, the
Rupert--offered a connection in all directions with the dense forests and the broad plains
of the interior.

The two competing nations both found their way to the great bay, the English by sea through
Hudson Strait, the French overland by the portage way from the upper valley of the Ottawa.
So it happened that there was established by royal charter in 1670 that notable body whose
corporate title is 'The Governor and Company of Adventurers of {36} England, trading into Hudson's
Bay.'  The company was founded primarily to engage in the fur trade.  But it was also pledged
by its charter to promote geographical discovery, and both the honour of its sovereign rights
and the promptings of its own commercial interest induced it to expand its territory of operations
to the greatest possible degree. During its early years, necessity compelled it to cling to
the coast. Its operations were confined to forts at the mouth of the Nelson, the Churchill,
and other rivers to which the Indian traders annually descended with their loads of furs. 
Moreover, the hostility of the French, who had founded the rival Company of the North, cramped
the activities of the English adventurers.  During the wars of King William and Queen Anne,
the territory of the bay became the scene of armed conflict.  Expeditions were sent overland
from Canada against the English company.  The little forts were taken and retaken, and the
echoes of the European struggle that was fought at Blenheim and at Malplaquet woke the stillness
of the northern woods of America.  But after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, the whole country
of the Bay was left to the English.

The Hudson's Bay Company were, therefore, {37} enabled to expand their operations.  By establishing
forts farther and farther in the interior they endeavoured to come into more direct relation
with the sources of their supply.  They were thus early led to surmise the great potential
wealth of the vast region that lay beyond their forts, and to become jealous of their title
thereto.  Their aversion to making public the knowledge of their territory lent to their operations
an air of mystery and secrecy, and their enemies accused them of being hostile to the promotion
of discovery.  For their own purposes, however, the company were willing to have their territory
explored as the necessities of their expanding commerce demanded.  As early as the close of
the seventeenth century (1691) a certain Henry Kelsey, in the service of the company, had made
his way from York Fort to the plains of the Saskatchewan.  After the Treaty of Utrecht had
brought peace and a clear title to the basin of the bay, the company endeavoured to obtain
more accurate knowledge of their territory and resources.

It had long been rumoured that valuable mines of copper lay in the Far North.  The early explorers
spoke of the Eskimos as having copper ore. Indians who came from the north-west to trade at
Fort Churchill reported the {38} existence of a great mountain of copper beside a river that
flowed north into the sea; in proof of this, they exhibited ornaments and weapons rudely fashioned
from the metal.  It is probable that attempts were made quite early in the century by the servants
of the company to reach this 'Coppermine River' by advancing into the interior.  But more serious
attempts were made by sea voyages along the western shore of the bay.  Such an expedition was
sent out from England under Governor Knight of the Hudson's Bay Company, and Captains Barlow
and Vaughan.  In 1719 their two ships, the Albany and the Discovery, sailed from England, and
were never seen again.  Not until half a century later was the story of their shipwreck on
Marble Island in the north of Hudson Bay and the protracted fate of the survivors learned from
savages who had been witnesses of the grim tragedy.  Other expeditions were sent northward
from time to time, but without success either in finding copper or in finding a passage westward
through the Arctic, which always remained at least an ostensible object of the search.

It so happened that in 1768 the Northern Indians brought down to Churchill such striking specimens
of copper ore that the interest of the {39} governor, Moses Norton, was aroused to the highest
point.  A man of determined character, he took ship straightway to England and obtained from
the directors of the company permission to send an expedition through the interior from Fort
Churchill to the Coppermine river.  The accomplishment of this task he entrusted to one Samuel
Hearne, whose overland journey, successfully carried out in the years 1769 to 1772, was to
prove one of the great landmarks in the exploration of the Far North.

Hearne, a youth of twenty-four years, had been trained in a rugged school.  He had gone to
sea at the age of eleven and at this tender age had taken part in his first sea-fight.  He
served as a naval midshipman during the Seven Years' War.  At its conclusion he became a mate
on one of the ships of the Hudson's Bay Company, in which position his industry and ingenuity
distinguished him among his associates.  For some years Hearne was employed in the fur trade
north of the Churchill, and gained a thorough knowledge of the coast of the bay.  For the expedition
inland Norton needed especially a man able to record with scientific accuracy the exact positions
which he reached.  Norton's choice fell upon Hearne.

The young man was instructed to make his {40} way to the Athabaska country and thence to find
if he could the river of the north whence the copper came, and to trace the river to the sea.
He was to note the position of any mines, to prepare the way for trade with the Indians, and
to find out from travel or enquiry whether there was a water passage through the continent.
Two white men (a sailor and a landsman) were sent in Hearne's service.  He had as guides an
Indian chief, Chawchinahaw, with a small band of his followers.  On November 6, 1769, the little
party set out, honoured by a salute of seven guns from the huge fortress of Fort Prince of
Wales, the massive ruins of which still stand as one of the strangest monuments of the continent.

The country which the explorer was to traverse in this and his succeeding journeys may be ranked
among the most inhospitable regions of the earth.  The northern limit of the great American
forest runs roughly in a line north-westward from Churchill to the mouth of the Mackenzie river.
East and north of this line is the country of the barren grounds, for the most part a desolate
waste of rock.  It is broken by precipitous watercourses and wide lakes, and has no vegetation
except the mosses and grasses which support great wandering {41} herds of caribou.  A few spruce
trees and hardy shrubs struggle northward from the limits of the great woods.  Even these die
out in the bitter climate, and then the explorer sees about him nothing but the wide waste
of barren rock and running water or in winter the endless mantle of the northern snow.

It is not strange that Hearne's first attempt met with complete failure.  His Indian companions
had, indeed, no intention of guiding him to the Athabaska country.  They deliberately kept
to the north of the woods, along the edge of the barren grounds, where Hearne and his companions
were exposed to the intense cold which set in a few days after their departure.  When they
camped at night only a few poor shrubs could be gathered to make a fire, and the travellers
were compelled to scoop out holes in the snow to shelter their freezing bodies against the
bitter blast.  The Indians, determined to prevent the white men from reaching their goal, provided
very little game. Hearne and his two servants were reduced to a ration of half a partridge
a day for each man.  Each day the Indian chief descanted at length upon the horrors of cold
and famine that still lay before them. Each day, with the obstinate pluck of his race, Hearne
struggled on. Thus {42} for nearly two hundred miles they made their way out into the snow-covered
wilderness.  At length a number of the Indians, determined to end the matter, made off in the
night, carrying with them a good part of the supplies.  The next day Chawchinahaw himself announced
that further progress was impossible.  He and his braves made off to the west, inviting Hearne
with mocking laughter to get home as best he might.  The three white men with a few Indians,
not of Chawchinahaw's band, struggled back through the snow to Fort Prince of Wales.  The whole
expedition had lasted five weeks.

In spite of this failure, neither Governor Norton nor Hearne himself was discouraged.  In less
than three months (on February 23, 1770) Hearne was off again for the north.  Convinced that
white men were of no use to him, he had the hardihood to set out accompanied only by Indians,
three from the northern country and three belonging to what were called at Churchill the Home
Guard, or Southern Indians.  There was no salute from the fort this time, for the cannon on
its ramparts were buried deep in snow.

Hearne's second expedition, though more protracted than the first, was doomed also to failure.
The little party followed on the former {43} trail along the Seal river, and thence, with the
first signs of opening spring, struck northwards over the barren grounds.  Leaving the woods
entirely behind, Hearne found himself in the broken and desolate country between Fort Churchill
and the three or four great rivers, still almost unknown, that flow into the head-waters of
Chesterfield Inlet.  In the beginning of June, as the snow began to melt, progress grew more
and more difficult.  Snowshoes became a useless encumbrance, and on the 10th of the month even
the sledges were abandoned.  Every man must now shoulder a heavy load.  Hearne himself staggered
under a pack which included a bag of clothes, a box of papers, a hatchet and other tools, and
the clumsy weight of his quadrant and its stand.  This article was too precious to be entrusted
to the Indians, for by it alone could the position of the explorers be recorded.  The party
was miserably equipped.  Unable to carry poles with them into a woodless region, they found
their one wretched tent of no service and were compelled to lie shelterless with alternations
of bitter cold and drenching rain.  For food they had to depend on such fish and game as could
be found.  In most cases it was eaten raw, as they had nothing with which to make a fire. 
{44} Worse still, for days together, food failed them.  Hearne relates that for four days at
the end of June he tramped northward, making twenty miles a day with no other sustenance than
water and such support as might be drawn from an occasional pipe of tobacco.  Intermittent
starvation so enfeebled his digestion that the eating of food when found caused severe pain.
Once for seven days the party had no other food than a few wild berries, some old leather,
and some burnt bones.  On such occasions as this, Hearne tells us, his Indians would examine
their wardrobe to see what part could be best spared and stay their hunger with a piece of
rotten deer skin or a pair of worn-out moccasins.  As they made their way northward, the party
occasionally crossed small rivers running north and east, but of so little depth that they
were able to ford them.  Presently, however, one great river proved too deep to cross on foot.
It ran north-east. Hearne's Indians called it the Cathawachaga, and the Canadian explorer Tyrrell
identifies it with the river now called the Kazan.  Here the party fell in with a band of Indians
who carried them across the river in their canoes.  On the northern side of the Cathawachaga,
Hearne and his men rested for a week, finding {45} a few deer and catching fish. As the guides
now said that in the country beyond there were other large rivers, Hearne bought a canoe from
one of the Indians, and gave in exchange for it a knife which had cost a penny in England.

In July the travellers moved on north-westward with better fortune. Deer became plentiful.
Bands of roving Indian hunters now attached themselves to the exploring party.  Hearne's guide
declared that it would be impossible to reach the Coppermine that season, and that they must
spend a winter in the Indian country.  The truth was that Hearne's followers had no intention
of going farther to the north, but preferred to keep company with the bands of hunters.  It
was useless for Hearne to protest.  He and his Indians drifted along to the west with the hunting
parties, now so numerous that by the end of July about seventy deer-skin tents were pitched
so as to form a little village.  There were about six hundred persons in the party.  Each morning
as they broke camp and set out on the march 'the whole ground for a large space around,' wrote
Hearne, 'seemed to be alive with men, women, children, and dogs.'

The country through which Hearne travelled, or wandered, in this mid-summer of 1770, {46} between
the rivers Kazan and Dubawnt, was barren indeed.  There were no trees and no vegetation except
moss and the plant called by the Indians wish-a-capucca--the 'Labrador tea' that is found everywhere
in the swamps of the northern forests.  Animal life was, however, abundant.  The caribou roaming
the barren grounds in the summer, to graze on the moss, were numerous.  There was ample food
for all the party, and the animals were, indeed, slaughtered recklessly, merely for the skins
and the more delicate morsels of the flesh.

The Dubawnt river midway in its course expands into Dubawnt Lake, a great sheet of water some
sixty-five miles long and forty miles broad. It lies in the same latitude as the south of Greenland.
No more desolate scene can be imagined than the picture revealed by modern photographs of the
country.  The low shores of the lake offer an endless prospect of barren rock and broken stone.
In the century and a half that have elapsed since Hearne's journey, only one or two intrepid
explorers have made their way through this region.  It still lies and probably will lie for
centuries unreclaimed and unreclaimable for the uses of civilization.

Hearne and his Indian hunters moved {47} westward and southward, passing in a circle round
the west shore of Lake Dubawnt, though at a distance of some miles from it.  The luckless travellers
had now but little chance of reaching the object of their search.  They were hundreds of miles
away even from the head waters of the Coppermine. The season was already late: the Indian guides
were quite unmanageable, while the natives whom Hearne met clamoured greedily for European
wares, ammunition and medicine, and cried out in disgust at his inability to supply their wants.

Then came an accident, fortunate perhaps, that compelled Hearne to abandon his enterprise.
While he was taking his noon observations, which showed him to be in latitude 63° 10' north,
he left his quadrant standing and sat down on the rocks to eat his dinner.  A sudden gust of
wind dashed the delicate instrument to the ground, where it lay in fragments.  This capped
the climax.  Unable any longer to ascertain his exact whereabouts, with no trustworthy guidance
and no prospect of winter supplies or equipment, Hearne turned back towards the south. This
was on August 12, after a journey of nearly six months into the unknown north.

The return occupied three months and a {48} half.  They were filled with hardship.  On the
very first day of the long march, a band of Indians from the north, finding Hearne defenceless,
plundered him of wellnigh all he had.  'Nothing can exceed,' wrote Hearne, 'the cool deliberation
of the villains.  A committee of them entered my tent. The ringleader seated himself on my
left hand.  They first begged me to lend them my skipertogan[1] to fill a pipe of tobacco.
After smoking two or three pipes, they asked me for several articles which I had not, and among
others for a pack of cards; but, on my answering that I had not any of the articles they mentioned,
one of them put his hand on my baggage and asked if it was mine.  Before I could answer in
the affirmative, he and the rest of his companions (six in number) had all my treasure spread
on the ground.  One took one thing and one another, till at last nothing was left but the empty
bag, which they permitted me to keep.'  At Hearne's urgent request, a few necessary articles
were restored to him.  From his Indian guides also the marauders took all they had except their
guns, a little ammunition, and a few tools.

Thus miserably equipped, Hearne and his {49} followers set out for home.  Their only tent consisted
of a blanket thrown over three long sticks.  They had no winter clothing, neither snow-shoes
nor sleds, and their food was such as could be found by the way.  The month of September was
unusually severe, and when the winter set in, the party suffered intensely from the cold, while
the want of snow-shoes made their march increasingly difficult.  The marvel is that Hearne
ever reached the fort at all.  He would not have done so very probably had it not been his
fortune to fall in with an Indian chief named Matonabbee, a man of strange and exceptional
character, to whom he owed not only his return to Fort Prince of Wales, but his subsequent
successful journey to the Coppermine.

This Indian chief, when he fell in with Hearne (September 20, 1770), was crossing the barren
grounds on his way to the fort with furs.  As a young man, Matonabbee had resided for years
among the English.  He had some knowledge of the language, and was able to understand that
a certain merit would attach to the rescue of Hearne from his predicament.  Moreover, the chief
had himself been to the Coppermine river, and it was partly owing to his account of it that
Governor {50} Norton had sent Hearne into the barren grounds.

Matonabbee hastened to relieve the young explorer's sufferings.  He provided him with warm
deer-skins and, from his ample supplies, prepared a great feast for the good cheer of his new
acquaintance.  An orgy of eating followed, dear to the Indian heart, and after this, without
fire-water to drink, the Indians sang and danced about the fires of the bivouac.  Matonabbee
and Hearne travelled together for several days towards the fort, making only about twelve miles
a day. The Indian then directed Hearne to go eastward to a little river where wood enough could
be found for snow-shoes and sledges, while he himself went forward at such a slow pace as to
allow Hearne and his party to overtake him.  This was done and Hearne, now better equipped,
rejoined Matonabbee, after which they continued together for a fortnight, making good progress
over the snow.  As they drew near the fort their ammunition was almost spent and the game had
almost disappeared.  By Matonabbee's advice, Hearne, accompanied by four Indians, left the
main party in order to hasten ahead as rapidly as possible.  The daylight was now exceedingly
short, but the moon and the aurora borealis {51} illuminated the brilliant waste of snow. 
The weather was intensely cold.  One of Hearne's dogs was frozen to death.  But in spite of
hardship the advance party reached Fort Prince of Wales safe and sound on November 25, 1770.
Matonabbee arrived a few days later.

Strange as it may seem, Hearne was off again in less than a fortnight on his third quest of
the Coppermine.  The time that he had spent in Matonabbee's company had given him a great opinion
of the character of the chief; 'the most sociable, kind, and sensible Indian I have ever met'--so
Hearne described him.  The chief himself had offered to lead Hearne to the great river of the
north.  Governor Norton willingly furnished ammunition, supplies, and a few trading goods.
The expedition started in the depth of winter.  But this time, with better information to guide
them, the travellers made no attempt to strike directly northward.  Instead, they moved towards
the west so as to cross the lower reaches of the barren grounds as soon as possible and proceed
northward by way of the basin of the Great Slave Lake, where they would find a wooded country
reaching far to the north.  A glance at the map will show the immensity of the task before
them.  The distance from Fort Churchill {52} to the Slave Lake, even as the crow flies, is
some seven hundred miles, and from thence to the Arctic sea four hundred and fifty, and the
actual journey is longer by reason of the sinuous course which the explorer must of necessity
pursue.  The whole of this vast country was as yet unknown: no white man had looked upon the
Mackenzie river nor upon the vast lakes from which it flows. It speaks well for the quiet intrepidity
of Hearne that he was ready alone to penetrate the trackless waste of an unknown country, among
a band of savages and amid the rigour of the northern winter.

The journey opened gloomily enough.  The month of December was spent in toiling painfully over
the barren grounds.  The sledges were insufficient, and Hearne as well as his companions had
to trudge under the burden of a heavy load.  At best some sixteen or eighteen miles could be
traversed in the short northern day.  Intense cold set in. Game seemed to have vanished, and
Christmas found the party plodding wearily onward, foodless, moving farther each day from the
little outpost of civilization that lay behind them on the bleak shores of Hudson Bay.

I must confess [wrote Hearne in his {53} journal] that I never spent so dull a Christmas; and
when I recollected the merry season which was then passing, and reflected on the immense quantities
and great variety of delicacies which were then expending in every part of Christendom, I could
not refrain from wishing myself again in Europe, if it had only been to have had an opportunity
of alleviating the extreme hunger that I suffered with the refuse of the table of one of my
acquaintances.

At the end of the month (December 1770), they reached the woods, a thick growth of stunted
pine and poplar with willow bushes growing in the frozen swamps.  Here they joined a large
party of Matonabbee's band, for the most part women and children.  The women were by no means
considered by the chief as a hindrance to the expedition.  Indeed, he attributed Hearne's previous
failure to their absence.

The two opening months of the year 1771 were spent in travelling westward towards Wholdaia
Lake.  The country was wooded, though here and there, the observer, standing on the higher
levels, could see the barren grounds to the northward.  The cold was intense, especially when
a frozen lake or river exposed the travellers to the full force of the wind.  But game was
plentiful.  At intervals the party halted and killed caribou in such quantities that three
and four days were sometimes spent in camp in a vain attempt to eat the spoils of the chase.
The Indians, Hearne remarked, slaughtered the game recklessly, with no thought of the morrow.

Wholdaia Lake was reached on March 2.  This is a long sheet of water lying some thirty miles
north of the parallel of sixty degrees.  At {55} the point where Hearne crossed it on the ice,
it was twenty-seven miles broad; its length appears to be four or five times as great.  It
is still almost unknown, for it lies far beyond the confines of present settlement and has
been seen only by explorers.

From Wholdaia Lake the course was continued westward.  The weather was moderate.  There was
abundant game, the skies overhead were bright, and the journey assumed a more agreeable aspect.
Here and there bands of roving Indians were seen, as also were encampments of hunters engaged
in snaring deer in the forest.  In the middle of April, the party rested for ten days in camp
beside a little lake which marked the westward limit of their march.  From here on, the course
was to lie northward again.  The Indians were therefore employed in gathering staves and birch-bark
to be used for tent poles and canoes when the party should again reach the barren grounds on
their northern route.

The opening of May found the party at Lake Clowey, whose waters run westward to the Great Slave
Lake.  Here they again halted, and the Indians built birch-bark canoes out of the material
they had carried from the woods.  In traversing the barren grounds, where both the {56} direction
and the nature of the rivers render them almost useless for navigation, the canoe plays a part
different from that which is familiar throughout the rest of Canada.  During the greater part
of the journey, often for a stretch of a hundred miles at a time, the canoe is absolutely useless,
or worse, since it must be carried.  Here and there, however, for the crossing of the larger
rivers, it is indispensable.  Large numbers of Indians were assembling at Clowey Lake during
Hearne's stay there, and were likewise engaged in building canoes.  A considerable body of
them, hearing that Matonabbee and his band were on the way to the Coppermine, eagerly agreed
to travel with them.  It seemed to them an excellent opportunity for making a combined attack
on their hereditary enemy, the Eskimos at the mouth of the river.  The savages thereupon set
themselves to make wooden shields about three feet long with which to ward off the arrows of
the Eskimos.

On May 20, a new start was made to the north.  Matonabbee and his great company of armed Indians
now assumed the appearance of a war party, and hurried eagerly towards the enemy's country.
Two days after leaving Lake Clowey, they passed out of the woods on {57} to the barren grounds.
To facilitate their movements most of the women were presently left behind together with the
children and dogs.  A number of the braves, weary already of the prospect of the long march,
turned back, but Matonabbee, Hearne, and about one hundred and fifty Indians held on with all
speed towards the north.  Their path as traced on a modern map runs by way of Clinton-Colden
and Aylmer lakes and thence northward to the mouth of the Coppermine.  By the latter part of
June the ice was breaking up, and on the 22nd the party made use of their canoes (which had
been carried for over a month) in order to cross a great river rejoicing in the ponderous name
of the Congecathawachaga. On the farther side, they met a number of Copper Indians who were
delighted to learn of Matonabbee's hostile design against the Eskimos. They eagerly joined
the party, celebrating their accession by a great feast.

The Copper Indians expressed their pleasure at learning from Hearne that the great king their
father proposed to send ships to visit them by the northern sea.  They had never seen a white
man before and examined Hearne with great curiosity, disapproving strongly of the colour of
his skin and comparing his hair to a stained buffalo tail.

{58}

The whole party moved on together.  The weather was bad, with alternating sleet and rain, and
the path broken and difficult.  July 4 found them at the Stony Mountains, a rugged and barren
set of hills that seemed from a distance like a pile of broken stones.  Nine days more of arduous
travel brought the warriors in sight of their goal. From the elevation of the low hills that
rose above its banks, Hearne was able to look upon the foaming waters of the Coppermine, as
it plunged over the broken stones of its bed in a series of cascades.  A few trees, or rather
a few burnt stumps, fringed the banks, but the trees which here and there remained unburned
were so crooked and dwarfish as merely to heighten the desolation of the scene.

Immediately on their arrival at the Coppermine, Matonabbee and his Indians began to make their
preparations for an attack upon the Eskimos, who were known to frequent the mouth of the river.
Spies were sent out in advance towards the sea, and the remainder of the Indians showed an
unwonted and ominous energy in building fires and roasting meat so that they might carry with
them a supply so large as to make it unnecessary to alarm the Eskimos by the sound of the guns
of the hunters {59} in search of food.  Hearne occupied himself with surveying the river. 
He was sick at heart at the scene of bloodshed which he anticipated, but was powerless to dissuade
his companions from their design.  Two days later (July 15, 1771), the spies brought back word
that a camp of Eskimos, five tents in all, had been seen on the further side of the river.
It was distant about twelve miles and favourably situated for a surprise.  Matonabbee and his
braves were now filled with the fierce eagerness of the savage; they crossed hurriedly to the
west side of the river, where each Indian painted the shield that he carried with rude daubs
of red and black, to imitate the spirits of the earth and air on whom he relied for aid in
the coming fight. Noiselessly the Indians proceeded along the banks of the river, trailing
in a serpentine course among the rocks so as to avoid being seen upon the higher ground.  They
seemed to Hearne to have been suddenly transformed from an undisciplined rabble into a united
band. Northern and Copper Indians alike were animated by a single purpose and readily shared
with one another the weapons of their common stock.  The advance was made in the middle of
the night, but at this season of the year the whole {60} scene was brilliant with the light
of the midnight sun.  The Indians stole to within two hundred yards of the place indicated
by the guides.  From their ambush among the rocks they could look out upon the tents of their
sleeping victims.  The camp of the Eskimos stood on a broad ledge of rock at the spot where
the Coppermine, narrowed between lofty walls of red sandstone, roars foaming over a cataract
some three hundred yards in extent.

The Indians, sure of their prey, paused a few moments to make final preparations for the onslaught.
They cast aside their outer garments, bound back their hair from their eyes, and hurriedly
painted their foreheads and faces with a hideous coating of red and black.  Then with weapons
in hand they rushed forth upon their sleeping foe.

Hearne, unable to leave the spot, was compelled to witness in all its details the awful slaughter
which followed.

But it is needless to linger on the details of the massacre, which Hearne was thus compelled
to witness, and the revolting mutilation of the corpses which followed it.  To Matonabbee and
the other Indians the whole occurrence was viewed as a proper incident of tribal war, and the
feeble protests which Hearne contrived to make only drew down upon him the expression of their
contempt.

After the massacre followed plunder.  The Indians tore down the tents of the Eskimos and with
reckless folly threw tents, tent poles, and great quantities of food into the waters of the
cataract.  Having made a feast of fresh fish on the ruins of the camp, they then announced
to Hearne that they were ready to assist him in {62} going on to the mouth of the river.  The
desolate scene was left behind--the broad rock strewn with mangled bodies of the dead and the
broken remnants of their poor belongings.  Half a century later the explorer Franklin visited
the spot and saw the skulls and bones of the Eskimos still lying about. One of Franklin's Indians,
then an aged man, had been a witness of the scene.

From the hills beside the Bloody Falls, as the cataract is called, the eye could discern at
a distance of some eight miles the open water of the Arctic and the glitter of the ice beyond.
Hearne followed the river along its precipitous and broken course till he stood upon the shore
of the sea.  One may imagine with what emotion he looked out upon that northern ocean to reach
which he had braved the terrors of the Arctic winter and the famine of the barren grounds.
He saw before him about three-quarters of a mile of open sea, studded with rocks and little
islands: beyond that the clear white of the ice-pack stretched to the farthest horizon.  Hearne
viewed this scene in the bright sunlight of the northern day: but while he still lingered,
thick fog and drizzling rain rolled in from the sea and shut out the view.  For the sake of
form, as he said, he {63} erected a pile of stones and took possession of the coast in the
name of the Hudson's Bay Company.  Then, filled with the bitterness of a vain quest, Hearne
turned his face towards the south to commence his long march to the settlements.

Up to this point nothing had been seen of the supposed mountains of copper which formed the
principal goal of Hearne's undertaking.  The eagerness of the Indians had led them to hasten
directly to the camp of the Eskimos regardless of all else.  But on the second day of the journey
home, the guides led Hearne to the site of this northern Eldorado.  It lay among the hills
beside the Coppermine river at a spot thirty miles from the sea, and almost directly south
of the mouth of the river.  The prospect was strange.  Some mighty force, as of an earthquake,
seemed to have rent asunder the solid rock and strewn it in a confused and broken heap of boulders.
Through these a rivulet ran to join the Coppermine.  Here, said the Indians, was copper so
great in quantity that it could be gathered as easily as one might gather stones at Churchill.
Filled with a new eagerness, Hearne and his companions searched for four hours among the rocks.
Here and there a few splinters of native {64} copper were seen.  One piece alone, weighing
some four pounds, offered a slight reward for their quest.  This Hearne carried away with him,
convinced now that the mountain of copper and the inexhaustible wealth of the district were
mere fictions created by the cupidity of the savages or by the natural mystery surrounding
a region so grim and inaccessible as the rocky gorge by which the Coppermine rushes to the
cold seas of the north.

After Hearne's visit no explorer reached the lower waters of the Coppermine till Captain (afterwards
Sir John) Franklin made his memorable and marvellous overland journey of 1821.  Since Franklin's
time the region has been crossed only two or three times by explorers. They agree in stating
that loose copper and copper ore are freely found.  But it does not seem that, since 1771,
any white man has ever looked upon the valley of the great boulders which the Indians described
to Hearne as containing a fabulous wealth of copper.  The solitary piece of metal which he
brought home is still preserved by the Hudson's Bay Company.

There is no need to follow in detail the long journey which Hearne had to take in order to
{65} return to the fort.  The march lasted nearly a year, during which he was exposed to the
same hardship, famine and danger as on his way to the sea.  The route followed on the return
was different.  The party ascended the valley of the Coppermine as far as Point Lake, a considerable
body of water visited later by Franklin, and distant one hundred and sixty miles from the sea.
This was reached on September 3, 1771.  Four months were spent in travelling almost directly
south.  They passed over a rugged country of stone and marsh, buried deep in snow, with here
and there a clump of stunted pine or straggling willow.  Bitter weather with great gales and
deep snow set in in October.  Snow-shoes and sledges were made.  Many small lakes and rivers,
now fast frozen, were traversed, but the whole country is still so little known that Hearne's
path can hardly be traced with certainty. By the middle of November the clumps of trees thickened
into the northern edge of the great forest.  The way now became easier.  They had better shelter
from the wind, and firewood was abundant.  For food the party carried dried meat from Point
Lake, and as they passed into the thicker woods they were fortunate enough to find a few rabbits
and wood partridges.  {66} Some fish were caught through the ice of the river.  But in nearly
two months of walking only two deer were seen.

On Christmas Eve Hearne found himself on the shores of a great frozen lake, so vast that, as
the Indians rightly informed him, it reached three hundred miles east and west.  This is the
Great Slave Lake; Hearne speaks of it as Athaspuscow Lake.  The latter name is the same as
that now given to another lake (Athabaska of Canadian maps)--the word being descriptive and
meaning the lake with the beds of reeds.

Hearne and his party crossed the great lake on the ice.  A new prospect now opened.  Deer and
beaver were plentiful among the islands.  Great quantities of fine fish abounded in the waters
under the ice.  As they reached the southern shore, the jumble of rocks and hills and stunted
trees of the barren north was left behind, and the travellers entered a fine level country,
over which wandered great herds of buffalo and moose.  For about forty miles they ascended
the course of the Athabaska river, finding themselves among splendid woods with tall pines
and poplars such as Hearne had never seen.  From the Athabaska they struck eastward, plunging
into so dense a forest that {67} at times the axes had to be used to clear the way.  For two
months (January and February of 1772) they made their way through the northern forest.  The
month of March found them clear of the level country of the Athabaska and entering upon the
hilly and broken region which formed the territory of the Northern Indians.  At the end of
March the first thaws began, rendering walking difficult in the bush.  In traversing the open
lakes and plains they were frequently exposed to the violent gales of the equinoctial season.
By the middle of April the signs of spring were apparent.  Flocks of waterfowl were seen overhead,
flying to the north. Their course was shaped directly to the east, so that the party were presently
traversing the same route as on their outward journey and making towards Wholdaia Lake.  The
month of May opened with fine weather and great thaws.  Such intense heat was experienced in
the first week of this month that for some days a march of twelve miles a day was all that
the travellers could accomplish.  Canoes were now built for the passage of the lakes and rivers.
By May 25 the expedition was clear of all the woods and out on the barren grounds. They passed
the Cathawachaga river, still covered with ice, {68} on the last day of May.  A month of travel
over the barren grounds brought them on the last day of June 1772 to the desolate but welcome
surroundings of Fort Prince of Wales.  Hearne had been absent on his last journey one year,
six months, and twenty-three days.  From his first journey into the wilderness until his final
return, there had elapsed two years, seven months, and twenty-four days.

Hearne was not left without honour.  The Hudson's Bay Company retained him in their service
at various factories, and three years after his famous expedition they made him governor of
Fort Prince of Wales. During his service there he had the melancholy celebrity of surrendering
the great fort (unfortunately left without men enough to defend it) to a French fleet under
Admiral La Pérouse.  Among the spoils of the captors was Hearne's manuscript journal, which
the generous victors returned on the sole condition that it should be published as soon as
possible.  Hearne returned to England in 1787, and was chiefly busied with revising and preparing
his journal until his death in 1792.

No better appreciation of his work has been written than the words with which he concludes
the account of his safe return after his years {69} of wandering.  'Though my discoveries,'
he writes, 'are not likely to prove of any material advantage to the nation at large, or indeed
to the Hudson's Bay Company, yet I have the pleasure to think that I have fully complied with
the orders of my masters, and that it has put a final end to all disputes concerning a North-West
Passage through Hudson's Bay.'

CHAPTER III

MACKENZIE DESCENDS THE GREAT RIVER OF THE NORTH

The next great landmark in the exploration of the Far North is the famous voyage of Alexander
Mackenzie down the river which bears his name, and which he traced to its outlet into the Arctic
ocean.  This was in 1789.  By that time the Pacific coast of America and the coast of Siberia
over against it had already been explored.  Even before Hearne's journey the Danish navigator
Bering, sailing in the employ of the Russian government, had discovered the strait which separates
Asia from America, and which commemorates his name.  Four years after Hearne's return (1776)
the famous navigator Captain Cook had explored the whole range of the American coast to the
north of what is now British Columbia, had passed Bering Strait and had sailed along the Arctic
coast as far as Icy Cape.

The general outline of the north of the {71} continent of America, and at any rate the vast
distance to be traversed to reach the Pacific from the Atlantic, could now be surmised with
some accuracy.  But the internal geography of the continent still contained an unsolved mystery.
It was known that vast bodies of fresh water far beyond the basin of the Saskatchewan and the
Columbia emptied towards the north. Hearne had revealed the existence of the Great Slave Lake,
and the advance of daring fur-traders into the north had brought some knowledge of the great
stream called the Peace, which rises far in the mountains of the west, and joins its waters
to Lake Athabaska.  It was known that this river after issuing from the Athabaska Lake moved
onwards, as a new river, in a vast flood towards the north, carrying with it the tribute of
uncounted streams.  These rivers did not flow into the Pacific.  Nor could so great a volume
of water make its way to the sea through the shallow torrent of the Coppermine or the rivers
that flowed north-eastward over the barren grounds.  There must exist somewhere a mighty river
of the north running to the frozen seas.

It fell to the lot of Alexander Mackenzie to find the solution of this problem.  The {72} circumstances
which led to his famous journey arose out of the progress of the fur trade and its extension
into the Far West.  The British possession of Canada in 1760 had created a new situation. 
The monopoly enjoyed by the Hudson's Bay Company was rudely disturbed.  Enterprising British
traders from Montreal, passing up the Great Lakes, made their way to the valley of the Saskatchewan
and, whether legally or not, contrived to obtain an increasing share of the furs brought from
the interior.  These traders were at first divided into partnerships and small groups, but
presently, for the sake of co-operation and joint defence, they combined (1787) into the powerful
body known as the North-West Company, which from now on entered into desperate competition
with the great corporation that had first occupied the field.  The Hudson's Bay Company and
its rival sought to carry their operations as far inland as possible in order to tap the supplies
at their source.  They penetrated the valleys of the Assiniboine, the Red, and the Saskatchewan
rivers, and founded, among others, the forts which were destined to become the present cities
of Winnipeg, Brandon, and Edmonton.  The annals of North-West Canada during the next thirty-three
years are made up of the {73} recital of the commercial rivalry, and at times the actual conflict
under arms, of the two great trading companies.

It was in the service of the North-West Company that Alexander Mackenzie made his famous journey.
He had arrived in Canada in 1779. After five years spent in the counting-house of a trading
company at Montreal, he had been assigned for a year to a post at Detroit, and in 1785 had
been elevated to the dignity of a bourgeois or partner in the North-West Company.  In this
capacity Alexander Mackenzie was sent out to the Athabaska district to take control, in that
vast and scarcely known region, of the posts of the traders now united into the North-West Company.

A glance at the map of Canada will show the commanding geographical position occupied by Lake
Athabaska, in a country where the waterways formed the only means of communication.  It receives
from the south and west the great streams of the Athabaska and the Peace, which thus connect
it with the prairies of the Saskatchewan valley and with the Rocky Mountains.  Eastward a chain
of lakes and rivers connects it and the forest country which lies about it with the barren
grounds and the forts on Hudson Bay, while to the north, {74} issuing from Lake Athabaska,
a great and unknown river led into the forests, moving towards an unknown sea.

It was Mackenzie's first intention to make Lake Athabaska the frontier of the operations of
his company.  Acting under his instructions, his cousin Roderick Mackenzie, who served with
him, selected a fine site on a cape on the south side of the lake and erected the post that
was named Fort Chipewyan.  Beautifully situated, with good timber and splendid fisheries and
easy communication in all directions, the fort rapidly became the central point of trade and
travel in the far north-west.  But it was hardly founded before Mackenzie had already conceived
a wider scheme.  Chipewyan should be the emporium but not the outpost of the fur trade; using
it as a base, he would descend the great unknown waterway which led north, and thus bring into
the sphere of the company's operations the whole region between Lake Athabaska and the northern
sea.  Alexander Mackenzie's object was, in name at least, commercial--the extension of the
trade of the North-West Company.  But in reality, his incentive was that instinctive desire
to widen the bounds of geographical knowledge, and to roll back the {75} mystery of unknown
lands and seas which had already raised Hearne to eminence, and which later on was to lead
Franklin to his glorious disaster.

It was on Wednesday, June 3, 1789, that Alexander Mackenzie's little flotilla of four birch-bark
canoes set out across Lake Athabaska on its way to the north.  In Mackenzie's canoe were four
French-Canadian voyageurs, two of them accompanied by their wives, and a German.  Two other
canoes were filled with Indians, who were to act as guides and interpreters.  At their head
was a notable brave who had been one of the band of Matonabbee, Hearne's famous guide.  From
his frequent visits to the English post at Fort Churchill he had acquired the name of the 'English
Chief.'  Another canoe was in charge of Leroux, a French-Canadian in the service of the company,
who had already descended the Slave river, as far as the Great Slave Lake.  Leroux and his
men carried trading goods and supplies.

The first part of the journey was by a route already known.  The voyageurs paddled across the
twenty miles of water which here forms the breadth of Lake Athabaska, entered a river running
from the lake, and followed its {76} winding stream.  They encamped at night seven miles from
the lake.  The next morning at four o'clock the canoes were on their way again, descending
the winding river through a low forest of birch and willow.  After a paddle of ten miles, a
bend in the little river brought the canoes out upon the broad stream of the Peace river, its
waters here being upwards of a mile wide and running with a strong current to the north.  On
our modern maps this great stream after it leaves Lake Athabaska is called the Slave river:
but it is really one and the same mighty river, carrying its waters from the valleys of British
Columbia through the gorges of the Rocky Mountains, passing into the Great Slave Lake, and
then, under the name of the Mackenzie, emptying into the Arctic.

In the next five days Mackenzie's canoes successfully descended the river to the Great Slave
Lake, a distance of some two hundred and thirty-five miles.  The journey was not without its
dangers.  The Slave river has a varied course: at times it broadens out into a great sheet
of water six miles across, flowing with a gentle current and carrying the light canoes gently
upon its unruffled surface.  In other places it is confined into a narrow channel, breaks into
swift eddies and pours in {77} boiling rapids over the jagged rocks.  Over the upper rapids
of the river, Mackenzie and his men were able to run their canoes fully laden; but lower down
were long and arduous portages, rendered dangerous by the masses of broken ice still clinging
to the banks of the river.  As they neared the Great Slave Lake boisterous gales from the north-east
lashed the surface of the river into foam and brought violent showers of rain.  But the voyageurs
were trained men, accustomed to face the dangers of northern navigation.

A week of travel brought them on June 9 to the Great Slave Lake.  It was still early in the
season.  The rigour of winter was not yet relaxed.  As far as the eye could see the surface
of the lake presented an unbroken sheet of ice.  Only along the shore had narrow lanes of open
water appeared.  The weather was bitterly cold, and there was no immediate prospect of the
break-up of the ice.

For a fortnight Mackenzie and his party remained at the lake, skirting its shores as best they
could, and searching among the bays and islands of its western end for the outlet towards the
north which they knew must exist.  Heavy rain, alternating with bitter cold, caused them much
hardship.  At times it froze so {78} hard that a thin sheet of new ice covered even the open
water of the lake.  But as the month advanced the mass of old ice began slowly to break; strong
winds drove it towards the north, and the canoes were presently able to pass, with great danger
and difficulty, among the broken floes.  Mackenzie met a band of Yellow Knife Indians, who
assured him that a great river ran out of the west end of the lake, and offered a guide to
aid him in finding the channel among the islands and sandbars of the lake.  Convinced that
his search would be successful, Mackenzie took all the remaining supplies into his canoes and
sent back Leroux to Chipewyan with the news that he had gone north down the great river.  But
even after obtaining his guide Mackenzie spent four days searching for the outlet  It was not
till the end of the month of June that his search was rewarded, and, at the extreme south-west,
the lake, after stretching out among islands and shallows, was found to contract into the channel
of a river.

The first day of July saw Mackenzie's canoes floating down the stream that bears his name.
From now on, progress became easier.  At this latitude and season the northern day gave the
voyageurs twenty hours of sunlight in each day, {79} and with smooth water and a favouring
current the descent was rapid.  Five days after leaving the Great Slave Lake the canoes reached
the region where the waters of the Great Bear Lake, then still unknown, drain into the Mackenzie.
The Indians of this district seemed entirely different from those known at the trading posts.
At the sight of the canoes and the equipment of the voyageurs they made off and hid among the
rocks and trees beside the river. Mackenzie's Indians contrived to make themselves understood,
by calling out to them in the Chipewyan language, but the strange Indians showed the greatest
reluctance and apprehension, and only with difficulty allowed Mackenzie's people to come among
them.  Mackenzie notes the peculiar fact that they seemed unacquainted with tobacco, and that
even fire-water was accepted by them rather from fear of offending than from any inclination.
Knives, hatchets and tools, however, they took with great eagerness.  On learning of Mackenzie's
design to go on towards the north they endeavoured with every possible expression of horror
to induce him to turn back.  The sea, they said, was so far away that winter after winter must
pass before Mackenzie could hope to reach it: he would be an old man {80} before he could complete
the voyage.  More than this, the river, so they averred, fell over great cataracts which no
one could pass; he would find no animals and no food for his men. The whole country was haunted
by monsters.  Mackenzie was not to be deterred by such childish and obviously interested terrors.
His interpreters explained that he had no fear of the horrors that they depicted, and, by a
heavy bribe, consisting of a kettle, an axe, and a knife, he succeeded in enlisting the services
of one of the Indians as a guide.  That the terror of the Far North professed by these Indians,
or at any rate the terror of going there in strange company, was not wholly imaginary was made
plain from the conduct of the guide.  When the time came to depart he showed every sign of
anxiety and fear: he sought in vain to induce his friends to take his place: finding that he
must go, he reluctantly bade farewell to his wife and children, cutting off a lock of his hair
and dividing it into three parts, which he fastened to the hair of each of them.

On July 5, the party set out with their new guide, and on the same afternoon passed the mouth
of the Great Bear river, which joins the Mackenzie in a flood of sea-green water, fresh, but
coloured like that of the ocean.  Below {81} this point, they passed many islands.  The banks
of the river rose to high mountains covered with snow.  The country, so the guide said, was
here filled with bears, but the voyageurs saw nothing worse than mosquitoes, which descended
in clouds upon the canoes.  As the party went on to the north, the guide seemed more and more
stricken with fear and consumed with the longing to return to his people.  In the morning after
breaking camp nothing but force would induce him to embark, and on the fourth night, during
the confusion of a violent thunder-storm, he made off and was seen no more.

The next day, however, Mackenzie supplied his place, this time by force, from a band of roving
Indians.  The new guide told him that the sea was not far away, and that it could be reached
in ten days.  As the journey continued the river was broken into so many channels and so dotted
with islands, that it was almost impossible to decide which was the main waterway.  The guide's
advice was evidently influenced by his desire to avoid the Eskimos, and, like his predecessor,
to keep away from the supposed terrors of the North.  The shores of the river were now at times
low, though usually lofty mountains could be seen about ten miles {82} away.  Trees were still
present, especially fir and birch, though in places both shores of the river were entirely
bare, and the islands were mere banks of sand and mud to which great masses of ice adhered.
An observation taken on July 10 showed that the voyageurs had reached latitude 67° 47' north.
From the extreme variation of the compass, and from other signs, Mackenzie was now certain
that he was approaching the northern ocean.  He was assured that in a few days more of travel
he could reach its shores.  But in the meantime his provisions were running low.  His Indian
guide, a prey to fantastic terrors, endeavoured to dissuade him from his purpose, while his
canoe men, now far beyond the utmost limits of the country known to the fur trade, began to
share the apprehensions of the guide, and clamoured eagerly for return.  Mackenzie himself
was of the opinion that it would not be possible for him to return to Chipewyan while the rivers
were still open, and that the approach of winter must surprise him in these northern solitudes.
But in spite of this he could not bring himself to turn back.  With his men he stipulated for
seven days; if the northern ocean were not found in that time he would turn south again.

{83}

The expedition went forward.  On July 10, they made a course of thirty-two miles, the river
sweeping with a strong current through a low, flat country, a mountain range still visible
in the west and reaching out towards the north.  At the spot where they pitched their tents
at night on the river bank they could see the traces of an encampment of Eskimos.  The sun
shone brilliantly the whole night, never descending below the horizon.  Mackenzie sat up all
night observing its course in the sky.  At a quarter to four in the morning, the canoes were
off again, the river winding and turning in its course but heading for the north-west.  Here
and there on the banks they saw traces of the Eskimos, the marks of camp fires, and the remains
of huts, made of drift-wood covered with grass and willows.  This day the canoes travelled
fifty-four miles.  The prospect about the travellers was gloomy and dispiriting.  The low banks
of the river were now almost treeless, except that here and there grew stunted willow, not
more than three feet in height.  The weather was cloudy and raw, with gusts of rain at intervals.
The discontent of Mackenzie's companions grew apace: the guide was evidently at the end of
his knowledge; while the violent rain, the biting cold {84} and the fear of an attack by hostile
savages kept the voyageurs in a continual state of apprehension.  July 12 was marked by continued
cold, and the canoes traversed a country so bare and naked that scarcely a shrub could be seen.
At one place the land rose in high banks above the river, and was bright with short grass and
flowers, though all the lower shore was now thick with ice and snow, and even in the warmer
spots the soil was only thawed to a depth of four inches.  Here also were seen more Eskimo
huts, with fragments of sledges, a square stone kettle, and other utensils lying about.

Mackenzie was now at the very delta of the great river, where it discharges its waters, broken
into numerous and intricate channels, into the Arctic ocean.  On Sunday, July 12, the party
encamped on an island that rose to a considerable eminence among the flat and dreary waste
of broken land and ice in which the travellers now found themselves.  The channels of the river
had here widened into great sheets of water, so shallow that for stretches of many miles, east
and west, the depth never exceeded five feet.  Mackenzie and 'English Chief,' his principal
follower, ascended to the highest ground on the island, {85} from which they were able to command
a wide view in all directions.  To the south of them lay the tortuous and complicated channels
of the broad river which they had descended; east and north were islands in great number; but
on the westward side the eye could discern the broad field of solid ice that marked the Arctic
ocean.

Mackenzie had reached the goal of his endeavours.  His followers, when they learned that the
open sea, the mer d'ouest as they called it, was in sight, were transformed; instead of sullen
ill-will they manifested the highest degree of confidence and eager expectation. They declared
their readiness to follow their leader wherever he wished to go, and begged that he would not
turn back without actually reaching the shore of the unknown sea.  But in reality they had
already reached it.  That evening, when their camp was pitched and they were about to retire
to sleep, under the full light of the unsinking sun, the inrush of the Arctic tide, threatening
to swamp their baggage and drown out their tents, proved beyond all doubt that they were now
actually on the shore of the ocean.

For three days Mackenzie remained beside the Arctic ocean.  Heavy gales blew in from {86} the
north-west, and in the open water to the westward whales were seen.  Mackenzie and his men,
in their exultation at this final proof of their whereabouts, were rash enough to start in
pursuit in a canoe.  Fortunately, a thick curtain of fog fell on the ocean and terminated the
chase.  In memory of the occurrence, Mackenzie called his island Whale Island.  On the morning
of July 14, 1789, Mackenzie, convinced that his search had succeeded, ordered a post to be
erected on the island beside his tents, on which he carved the latitude as he had calculated
it (69° 14' north), his own name, the number of persons who were with him and the time that
was spent there.

This day Mackenzie spent in camp, for a great gale, blowing with rain and bitter cold, made
it hazardous to embark.  But on the next morning the canoes were headed for the south, and
the return journey was begun. It was time indeed.  Only about five hundred pounds weight of
supplies was now left in the canoes--enough, it was calculated, to suffice for about twelve
days.  As the return journey might well occupy as many weeks, the fate of the voyageurs must
now depend on the chances of fishing and the chase.

{87}

As a matter of fact the ascent of the river, which Mackenzie conducted with signal success
and almost without incident, occupied two months. The weather was favourable.  The wild gales
which had been faced in the Arctic delta were left behind, and, under mild skies and unending
sunlight, and with wild fowl abundant about them, the canoes were urged steadily against the
stream.  The end of the month of July brought the explorers to the Great Bear river; from this
point an abundance of berries on the banks of the stream--the huckleberry, the raspberry and
the saskatoon--afforded a welcome addition to their supplies.  As they reached the narrower
parts of the river, where it flowed between high banks, the swift current made paddling useless
and compelled the men to haul the canoes with the towing line.  At other times steady strong
winds from the north enabled them to rig their sails and skim without effort over the broad
surface of the river.  Mackenzie noted with interest the varied nature and the fine resources
of the country of the upper river.  At one place petroleum, having the appearance of yellow
wax, was seen oozing from the rocks; at another place a vast seam of coal in the river bank
was observed to be burning.  On August 22 the canoes were {88} driven over the last reaches
of the Mackenzie with a west wind strong and cold behind them, and were carried out upon the
broad bosom of the Great Slave Lake.  The voyageurs were once more in known country.  The navigation
of the lake, now free from ice, was without difficulty, and the canoes drove at a furious rate
over its waters.  On August 24 three canoes were sighted sailing on the lake, and were presently
found to contain Leroux and his party, who had been carrying on the fur trade in that district
during Mackenzie's absence.

The rest of the journey offered no difficulty.  There remained, indeed, some two hundred and
sixty miles of paddle and portage to traverse the Slave river and reach Fort Chipewyan.  But
to the stout arms of Mackenzie's trained voyageurs this was only a summer diversion.  On September
12, 1789, Alexander Mackenzie safely reached the fort.  His voyage had occupied one hundred
and two days.  Its successful completion brought to the world its first knowledge of that vast
waterway of the northern country, whose extensive resources in timber and coal, in mineral
and animal wealth, still await development.

CHAPTER IV

THE MEMORABLE EXPLOITS OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN

The generation now passing away can vividly recall, as one of the deepest impressions of its
childhood, the profound and sustained interest excited by the mysterious fate of Sir John Franklin.
His splendid record by sea and land, the fact that he was one of 'Nelson's men' and had fought
at Copenhagen and Trafalgar, his feats as an explorer in the unknown wilds of North America
and the torrid seas of Australasia, and, more than these, his high Christian courage and his
devotion to the flag and country that he served--all had made of Franklin a hero whom the nation
delighted to honour.  His departure in 1846 with his two stout ships the Erebus and the Terror
and a total company of one hundred and thirty-four men, including some of the ablest naval
officers of the day, was hailed with high hopes that the mysterious north would at length be
{90} robbed of its secret.  Then, as the years passed and the ships never returned, and no
message from the explorers came out of the silent north, the nation, defiant of difficulty
and danger, bent its energies towards the discovery of their fate.  No less than forty-two
expeditions were sent out in search of the missing ships.  The efforts of the government were
seconded by the munificence of private individuals, and by the generosity of naval officers
who gladly gave their services for no other reward than the honour of the enterprise.  The
energies of the rescue parties were quickened by the devotion of Lady Franklin, who refused
to abandon hope, and consecrated her every energy and her entire fortune to the search for
her lost husband.  Her conduct and her ardent appeals awoke a chivalrous spirit at home and
abroad; men such as Kane, Bellot, M'Clintock and De Haven volunteered their services in the
cause.  At length, as with the passage of years anxiety deepened into despair, and as little
by little it was learned that all were lost, the brave story of the death of Franklin and his
men wrote itself in imperishable letters on the hearts of their fellow-countrymen.  It found
no parallel till more than half a century later, when another and a {91} similar tragedy in
the silent snows of the Antarctic called forth again the mingled pride and anguish with which
Britain honours the memory of those fallen in her cause.

John Franklin belonged to the school of naval officers trained in the prolonged struggle of
the great war with France.  He entered the Royal Navy in 1800 at fourteen years of age, and
within a year was engaged on his ship, the Polyphemus, in the great sea-fight at Copenhagen.
During the brief truce that broke the long war after 1801, Franklin served under Flinders,
the great explorer of the Australasian seas.  On his way home in 1803 he was shipwrecked in
Torres Strait, and, with ninety-three others of the company of H.M.S. Porpoise, was cast up
on a sandbar, seven hundred and fifty miles from the nearest port.  The party were rescued,
Franklin reached England, and at once set out on a voyage to the China seas in the service
of the East India Company. During the voyage the merchant fleet with which he sailed offered
battle to a squadron of French men-of-war, which fled before them.  The next year saw Franklin
serving as signal midshipman on board the Bellerophon at Trafalgar.  He remained in active
service during the war, served in America, and was {92} wounded in the British attempt to capture
New Orleans.  After the war Franklin, now a lieutenant, found himself, like so many other naval
officers, unable, after the stirring life of the past fifteen years, to settle into the dull
routine of peace service.  Maritime discovery, especially since his voyage with Flinders, had
always fascinated his mind, and he now offered himself for service in that Arctic region with
which his name will ever be associated.

The long struggle of the war had halted the progress of discoveries in the northern seas. 
But on the conclusion of peace the attention of the nation, and of naval men in particular,
was turned again towards the north.  The Admiralty naturally sought an opportunity of giving
honourable service to their officers and men.  Great numbers of them had been thrown out of
employment.  Some migrated to the colonies or even took service abroad.  At the same time the
writings of Captain Scoresby, a whaling captain of scientific knowledge who published an account
of the Greenland seas, and the influence of such men as Sir John Barrow, the secretary of the
Admiralty, did much to create a renewal of public interest in the north.  It was now recognized
that the North-West Passage offered no commercial {93} attractions.  But it was felt that it
would not be for the honour of the nation that the splendid discoveries of Hearne, Cook and
Mackenzie should remain uncompleted.  To trace the Arctic water-way from the Atlantic to the
Pacific became now a supreme object, not of commercial interest, but of geographical research
and of national pride.  To this was added the fact that the progress of physical and natural
science was opening up new fields of investigation for the explorers of the north.

Franklin first sailed north in 1818, as second in command of the first Arctic expedition of
the nineteenth century.  Two brigs, H.M.S. Dorothea under Captain Buchan, and H.M.S. Trent
under Lieutenant John Franklin, set out from the Thames with a purpose which in audacity at
least has never been surpassed.  The new sentiment of supreme confidence in the navy inspired
by the conquest of the seas is evinced by the fact that these two square-rigged sailing ships,
clumsy and antiquated, built up with sundry extra beams inside and iron bands without, were
directed to sail straight north across the North Pole and down the world on the other side.
They did their best.  They went churning northward through the foaming seas, and when they
found that {94} the ice was closing in on them, and that they were being blown down upon it
in a gale as on to a lee shore, the order was given to put the helm up and charge full speed
at the ice.  It was the only possible way of escape, and it meant either sudden and awful death
under the ice floes or else the piling up of the ships safe on top of them--'taking the ice'
as Arctic sailors call it.  The Dorothea and the Trent went driving at the ice with such a
gale of snow about them that neither could see the other as they ran.  They 'took the ice'
with a mighty crash, amid a wild confusion of the elements, and when the storm cleared the
two old hulls lay shattered but safe on the surface of the ice-pack.  The whole larboard side
of the Dorothea was smashed, but they brought her somehow to Spitzbergen, and there by wonderful
patching enabled her to sail home.

The next year (1819) Lieutenant Franklin was off again on an Arctic journey, the record of
which, written by himself, forms one of the most exciting stories of adventure ever written.
The design this time was to follow the lead of Hearne and Mackenzie.  Beginning where their
labours ended, Franklin proposed to embark on the polar sea in canoes and follow the coast
line.  Franklin left England at the {95} end of May.  He was accompanied by Dr Richardson,
a naval surgeon, afterwards Sir John Richardson, and second only to Franklin himself as an
explorer and writer, Midshipman Back, later on to be Admiral Sir George Back, Midshipman Hood,
and one Hepburn, a stout-hearted sailor of the Royal Navy.  They sailed in the Hudson's Bay
Company ship Prince of Wales, and passed through the straits to York Factory.  Thence by canoe
they went inland, up the Hayes river, through Lake Winnipeg and thence up the Saskatchewan
to Cumberland House, a Hudson's Bay fort established by Samuel Hearne a few years after his
famous journey.  From York Factory to Cumberland House was a journey of six hundred and ninety
miles.  But this was only a beginning.  During the winter of 1819-20 Franklin and his party
made their way from Cumberland House to Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabaska, a distance, by the
route traversed, of eight hundred and fifty-seven miles.  From this fort the party, accompanied
by Canadian voyageurs and Indian guides, made their way, in the summer of 1820, to Fort Providence,
a lonely post of the North-West Company lying in latitude 62° on the northern shore of the
Great Slave Lake.

{96}

These were the days of rivalry, and even open war, between the two great fur companies, the
Hudson's Bay and the North-West.  The Admiralty had commended Franklin's expeditions to the
companies, who were to be requisitioned for the necessary supplies.  But the disorders of the
fur trade, and the demoralization of the Indians, owing to the free distribution of ardent
spirits by the rival companies, rendered it impossible for the party to obtain adequate supplies
and stores. Undeterred by difficulties, Franklin set out from Fort Providence to make his way
to the Arctic seas at the mouth of the Coppermine.  The expedition reached the height of land
between the Great Slave Lake and the Coppermine, on the borders of the country which had been
the scene of Hearne's exploits.  The northern forest is here reduced to a thin growth of stunted
pine and willow.  It was now the end of August.  The brief northern summer was drawing to its
close.  It was impossible to undertake the navigation of the Arctic coast till the ensuing
summer. Franklin and his party built some rude log shanties which they called Fort Enterprise.
Here, after having traversed over two thousand miles in all from York Factory, they spent their
second winter in the {97} north.  It was a season of great hardship.  With the poor materials
at their hand it was impossible to make their huts weatherproof.  The wind whistled through
the ill-plastered seams of the logs.  So intense was the winter cold that the trees about the
fort froze hard to their centres.  In cutting firewood the axes splintered as against stone.
In the officers' room the thermometer, sixteen feet from the log fire, marked as low as fifteen
degrees below zero in the day and forty below at night.  For food the party lived on deer's
meat with a little fish, tea twice a day (without sugar), and on Sunday a cup of chocolate
as the luxury of the week to every man.  But, undismayed by cold and hardship, they kept stoutly
at their work.  Richardson investigated the mosses and lichens beneath the snow and acquainted
himself with the mineralogy of the neighbourhood.  Franklin and the two lieutenants carried
out observations, their fingers freezing with the cold of forty-six below zero at noon of the
brief three-hour day in the heart of winter.  Sunday was a day of rest.  The officers dressed
in their best attire.  Franklin read the service of the Church of England to his assembled
company.  For the French-Canadian Roman Catholics, Franklin did the best he {98} could; he
read to them the creed of the Church of England in French.  In the leisure part of the day
a bundle of London newspapers was perused again and again.

The winter passed safely; the party now entered upon the most arduous part of their undertaking.
Canoes were built and dragged on improvised sledges to the Coppermine.  Franklin descended
the river, surveying its course as he went.  He passed by the scene of the massacre witnessed
by Hearne, and found himself, late in July of 1821, on the shores of the Arctic.  The distance
from Fort Enterprise was three hundred and thirty-four miles, for one hundred and seventeen
of which the canoes and baggage had been hauled over snow and ice.

Franklin and his followers, in two canoes, embarked on the polar sea and traced the course
of the coast eastward for five hundred and fifty miles.  The sailors were as men restored to
their own element.  But the Canadian voyageurs were filled with dread at the great waves of
the open ocean.  All that Franklin saw of the Arctic coast encouraged his belief that the American
continent is separated by stretches of sea from the great masses of land that had been already
discovered in the Arctic.  {99} The North-West Passage, ice-blocked and useless, was still
a geographical fact.  Eager in the pursuit of his investigations he went on eastward as long
as he dared--too long in fact.  Food was running low.  His voyageurs had lost heart, appalled
at the immense spaces of ice and sea through which their frail canoes went onward into the
unknown.  Reluctantly, Franklin decided to turn back.  But it was too late to return by water.
The northern gales drove the ice in against the coast.  Franklin and his men, dragging and
carrying one of the canoes, took to the land, in order to make their way across the barren
grounds.  By this means they hoped to reach the upper waters of the Coppermine and thence Fort
Enterprise, where supplies were to have been placed for them during the summer.  Their journey
was disastrous. Bitter cold set in as they marched.  Food failed them.  Day after day they
tramped on, often with blinding snow in their faces, with no other sustenance than the bitter
weed called tripe de roche that can here and there be scraped from the rocks beneath the snow.
At times they found frozen remnants of deer that had been killed by wolves, a few bones with
putrid meat adhering to them.  These they eagerly devoured. But {100} often day after day passed
without even this miserable sustenance.  At night they lay down beside a clump of willows,
trying, often in vain, to make a fire of the green twigs dragged from under the snow.  So great
was their famine, Franklin says, that the very sensation of hunger passed away, leaving only
an exhaustion too great for words.  Lieutenant Back, gaunt and emaciated, staggered forward
leaning on a stick, refusing to give in.  Richardson could hardly walk, while Lieutenant Hood,
emaciated to the last degree, was helped on by his comrades as best they could.  The Canadians
and Indians suffered less in body, but, lacking the stern purpose of the officers, they were
distraught with the horror of the death that seemed to await them.  In their fear they had
refused to carry the canoe, and had smashed it and thrown it aside.  In this miserable condition
the party reached, on September 26, the Coppermine river, to find it flowing still unfrozen
in an angry flood which they could not cross.  In vain they ranged the banks above and below.
Below them was a great lake; beside and above them a swift, deep current broken by rapids.
There was no crossing. They tried to gather willow faggots, and bind them into a raft.  But
the green wood sank so {101} easily that only one man could get upon the raft: to paddle or
pole it in the running water was impossible.  A line was made of strips of skin, and Richardson
volunteered to swim the river so as to haul the raft across with the line.  The bitter cold
of the water paralysed his limbs.  He was seen to sink beneath the leaping waters.  His companions
dragged him back to the bank, where for hours he lay as if lifeless beside the fire of willow
branches, so emaciated that he seemed a mere skeleton when they took off his wet clothing.
His comrades gazed at him with a sort of horror.  Thus for days they waited.  At last, with
infinite patience, one of the Canadians made a sort of canoe with willow sticks and canvas.
In this, with a line attached, they crossed the river one by one.

They were now only forty miles from Fort Enterprise.  But their strength was failing.  Hood
could not go on.  The party divided. Franklin and Back went forward with most of the men, while
Richardson and sailor Hepburn volunteered to stay with Hood till help could be sent.  The others
left them in a little tent, with some rounds of ammunition and willow branches gathered for
the fire.  A little further on the march, three of Franklin's followers, {102} too exhausted
to go on, dropped out, proposing to make their way back to Richardson and Hood.

The little party at the tent in the snow waited in vain.  Days passed, and no help came.  One
of the three men who had left Franklin, an Indian called Michel, joined them, saying that the
others had gone astray in the snow.  But he was strange and sullen, sleeping apart and wandering
off by himself to hunt.  Presently, from the man's strange talk and from some meat which he
brought back from his hunting and declared to be part of a wolf, Richardson realized the awful
truth that Michel had killed his companions and was feeding on their bodies.  A worse thing
followed.  Richardson and Hepburn, gathering wood a few days later, heard the report of a gun
from beside the fire where they had left Lieutenant Hood, who was now in the last stage of
exhaustion. They returned to find Michel beside the dead body of their comrade.  He had been
shot through the back of the head.  Michel swore that Hood had killed himself.  Richardson
knew the truth, but both he and Hepburn were too enfeebled by privation to offer fight to the
armed and powerful madman.  The three set out for Fort Enterprise, Michel carrying a loaded
gun, two {103} pistols and a bayonet, muttering to himself and evidently meditating a new crime.
Richardson, a man of iron nerve, forestalled him.  Watching his opportunity, he put a pistol
to the Indian's head and blew his brains out.

Richardson and Hepburn dragged themselves forward mile by mile, encouraged by the thought of
the blazing fires and the abundant food that they expected to find at Fort Enterprise.  They
reached the fort just in the dusk of an October evening.  All about it was silence. There were
no tracks in the newly fallen snow.  Only a thin thread of smoke from the chimney gave a sign
of life.  Hurriedly they made their way in.  To their horror and dismay they found Franklin
and three companions, two Canadians and an Indian, stretched out in the last stages of famine.
'No words can convey an idea,' wrote Dr Richardson later on, 'of the filth and wretchedness
that met our eyes on looking around.  Our own misery had stolen upon us by degrees and we were
accustomed to the contemplation of each other's emaciated figures, but the ghastly countenances,
dilated eye-balls, and sepulchral voices of Captain Franklin and those with him were more than
we could bear.' Franklin, on his part, was equally dismayed at the appearance of Richardson
and Hepburn.  {104} 'We were all shocked,' he says in his journal, 'at beholding the emaciated
countenances of the doctor and Hepburn, as they strongly evidenced their extremely debilitated
state. The alteration in our appearance was equally distressing to them, for since the swellings
had subsided we were little more than skin and bone.  There was no depot of provisions, as
had been arranged, nor any trace of a letter or other message from the traders at Fort Providence
or from the Indians.  Lieutenant Back, who had reached the fort a little in advance of Franklin,
had gone on in the hope of finding Indian hunters, or perhaps of reaching Fort Providence and
sending relief.  They had no food except a little tripe de roche, and Franklin had thus found
himself, as he explained to Richardson, in the deserted fort with five companions, in a state
of utter destitution.  Food there was none.  {105} From the refuse heaps of the winter before,
now buried under the snow, they dug out pieces of bone and a few deer-skins; on this, with
a little tripe de roche, they endeavoured to subsist.  The log house was falling into decay.
The seams gaped and the piercing air entered on every side with the thermometer twenty below
zero.  Franklin and his companions had tried in vain to stop the chinks and to make a fire
by tearing up the rough boards of the floor.  But their strength was insufficient.  Already
for two weeks before their arrival at Fort Enterprise they had had no meat. It was impossible
that they could have existed long in the miserable shelter of the deserted fort.  Franklin
had endeavoured to go on. Leaving three of his companions, now too exhausted to walk far, he
and the other two, a Canadian and an Eskimo, set out to try to reach help in the direction
of Fort Providence.  The snow was deep, and their strength was so far gone that in six hours
they only struggled four miles on their way.  At night they lay down beside one another in
the snow, huddled together for warmth, with a bitter wind blowing over their emaciated bodies.
The next morning, in recommencing their march, Franklin stumbled and fell, breaking his snow-shoe
in the {106} fall. Realizing that he could never hope to traverse the one hundred and eighty-six
miles to Fort Providence, he directed his companions to go on, and he himself made his way
back to Fort Enterprise.  There he had remained for a fortnight until found by Richardson and
Hepburn.  So weak had Franklin and his three companions become that they could not find the
strength to go on cutting down the log buildings of the fort to make a fire.  Adam, the Indian,
lay prostrate in his bunk, his body covered with hideous swellings.  The two Canadians, Peltier
and Samandré, suffered such pain in their joints that they could scarcely move a step.  A herd
of deer had appeared on the ice of the river near by, but none of the men had strength to pursue
them, nor could any one of them, said Franklin, have found the strength to raise a gun and fire it.

Such had been the position of things when Richardson and Hepburn, themselves almost in the
last stage of exhaustion, found their unhappy comrades.  Richardson was a man of striking energy,
of the kind that knows no surrender.  He set himself to gather wood, built up a blazing fire,
dressed as well as he could the swollen body of the Indian, and tried to bring some order into
the filth and squalor {107} of the hut. Hepburn meantime had killed a partridge, which the
doctor then divided among them in six parts, the first fresh meat that Franklin and those with
him had tasted for thirty-one days.  This done, 'the doctor,' so runs Franklin's story, 'brought
out his prayer book and testament, and some prayers and psalms and portions of scripture appropriate
to the situation were read.'

But beyond the consolation of manifesting a brave and devout spirit, there was little that
Richardson could do for his companions.  The second night after his arrival Peltier died. 
There was no strength left in the party to lift his body out into the snow.  It lay beside
them in the hut, and before another day passed Samandré, the other Canadian, lay dead beside
it.  For a week the survivors remained in the hut, waiting for death.  Then at last, and just
in time, help reached them.

On November 7, nearly a month after Franklin's first arrival at the fort, they heard the sound
of a musket and the shouting of men outside. Three Indians stood before the door.  The valiant
Lieutenant Back, after sufferings almost as great as their own, had reached a band of Indian
hunters and had sent three men travelling at top speed with enough food to {108} keep the party
alive till further succour could be brought.  Franklin and his friends were saved by one of
the narrowest escapes recorded in the history of northern adventure.  Another week passed before
the relief party of the Indians reached them, and even then Franklin and his companions were
so enfeebled by privation that they could only travel with difficulty, and a month passed before
they found themselves safe and sound within the shelter of Fort Providence on the Great Slave
Lake.  There they remained till the winter passed. A seven weeks' journey took them to York
Factory on Hudson Bay, whence they sailed to England.  Franklin's journey overland and on the
waters of the polar sea had covered in all five thousand five hundred and fifty miles and had
occupied nearly three years.

On his return to England Franklin found himself at once the object of a wide public interest.
Already during his absence he had been made a commander, and the Admiralty now promoted him
to the rank of captain, while the national recognition of his services was shortly afterwards
confirmed by the honour of knighthood.  One might think that after the perils which he had
braved and the horrors which he had experienced, Sir John would have {109} been content to
retire upon his laurels.  But it was not so.  There is something in the snow-covered land of
the Arctic, its isolation from the world and the long silence of its winter darkness, that
exercises a strange fascination upon those who have the hardihood to brave its perils.  It
was a moment too when interest in Arctic discovery and the advancement thereby of scientific
knowledge had reached the highest point yet known.  During Franklin's absence Captain Ross
and Lieutenant Parry had been sent by sea into the Arctic waters.  Parry had met with wonderful
success, striking from Baffin Bay through the northern archipelago and reaching half-way to
Bering Strait.

Franklin was eager to be off again.  The year 1825 saw him start once more to resume the survey
of the polar coast of America.  The plan now was to learn something of the western half of
the North American coast, so as to connect the discoveries of Sir Alexander Mackenzie with
those made by Cook and others through Bering Strait.  Franklin was again accompanied by his
gallant friend, Dr Richardson.  They passed again overland through the fur country, where the
recent union of the rival companies had brought about a new era.  They descended the Mackenzie
river, {110} wintered on Great Bear Lake, and descended thence to the sea.  Franklin struck
out westward, his party surveying the coast in open boats.  Their journey from their winter
quarters to the sea and along the coast covered a thousand miles, and extended to within one
hundred and sixty miles of the point that had then been reached by explorers from Bering Strait.
At the same time Richardson, going eastward from the Mackenzie, surveyed the coast as far as
the Coppermine river.  Their discoveries thus connected the Pacific waters with the Atlantic,
with the exception of one hundred and sixty miles on the north-west, where water was known
to exist and only ice blocked the way, and of a line north and south which should bring the
discoveries of Parry into connection with those of Franklin.  These two were the missing links
now needed in the chain of the North-West Passage.

But more than twenty years were to elapse before the discoveries thus made were carried to
their completion.  Franklin himself, claimed by other duties, was unable to continue his work
in the Arctic, and his appointment to the governorship of Tasmania called him for a time to
another sphere.  Yet, little by little, the exploration of the Arctic regions was carried {111}
on, each explorer adding something to what was already known, and each hoping that the honour
of the discovery of the great passage would fall to his lot.  Franklin's comrade Back, now
a captain and presently to be admiral, made his way in 1834 from Canada to the polar sea down
the river that bears his name.  Three years later Simpson, in the service of the Hudson's Bay
Company, succeeded in traversing the coast from the Mackenzie to Point Barrow, completing the
missing link in the western end of the chain.  John and James Ross brought the exploration
of the northern archipelago to a point that made it certain that somewhere or other a way through
must exist to connect Baffin Bay with the coastal waters.  At last the time came, in 1844,
when the British Admiralty determined to make a supreme effort to unite the explorations of
twenty-five years by a final act of discovery.  The result was the last expedition of Sir John
Franklin, glorious in its disaster, and leaving behind it a tale that will never be forgotten
while the annals of the British nation remain.

{112}

CHAPTER V

THE TRAGEDY OF FRANKLIN'S FATE

The month of May 1845 found two stout ships, the Erebus and the Terror, riding at anchor in
the Thames.  Both ships were already well known to the British public.  They had but recently
returned from the Antarctic seas, where Captain Sir James Ross, in a voyage towards the South
Pole, had attained the highest southern latitude yet reached. Both were fine square-rigged
ships, strengthened in every way that the shipwrights of the time could devise.  Between their
decks a warming and ventilating apparatus of the newest kind had been installed, and, as a
greater novelty still, the attempt was now made for the first time in history to call in the
power of steam for the fight against the Arctic frost.  Each vessel carried an auxiliary screw
and an engine of twenty horse-power.  When we remember that a modern steam vessel with a horse-power
of many thousands is still {113} powerless against the northern ice, the Erebus and the Terror
arouse in us a forlorn pathos.  But in the springtime of 1845 as they lay in the Thames, an
object of eager interest to the flocks of sightseers in the neighbourhood, they seemed like
very leviathans of the deep.  Vast quantities of stores were being loaded into the ships, enough,
it was said, for the subsistence of the one hundred and thirty-four members of the expedition
for three years.  For it was now known that Arctic explorers must be prepared to face the winter,
icebound in their ships through the long polar night.  That the winter could be faced with
success had been shown by the experience of Sir William Parry, whose ships, the Fury and the
Hecla, had been ice-bound for two winters (1821-23), and still more by that of Captain John
Ross, who brought home the crew of the Victory safe and sound in 1833, after four winters in
the ice.

All England was eager with expectancy over the new expedition.  It was to be commanded by Sir
John Franklin, the greatest sailor of the day, who had just returned from his five years in
Van Diemen's Land and carried his fifty-nine winters as jauntily as a midshipman.  The era
was auspicious.  A new reign under a {114} queen already beloved had just opened.  There was
every hope of a long, some people said a perpetual, peace: it seemed fitting that the new triumphs
of commerce and science, of steam and the magnetic telegraph, should replace the older and
cruder glories of war.

The expedition was well equipped for scientific research, but its main object was the discovery
of the North-West Passage.  We have already seen what this phrase had come to mean.  It had
now no reference to the uses of commerce.  The question was purely one of geography.  The ocean
lying north of America was known to be largely occupied by a vast archipelago, between which
were open sounds and seas, filled for the greater part of the year with huge packs of ice.
In the Arctic winter all was frozen into an unending plain of snow, broken by distorted hummocks
of ice, and here and there showing the frowning rocks of a mountainous country swept clean
by the Arctic blast.  In the winter deep night and intense cold settled on the scene.  But
in the short Arctic summer the ice-pack moved away from the shores.  Lanes of water extended
here and there, and sometimes, by the good fortune of a gale, a great sheet of open sea with
blue tossing waves gladdened the heart of the {115} sailor.  Through this region somewhere
a water-way must exist from east to west.  The currents of the sea and the drift-wood that
they carried proved it beyond a doubt.  Exploration had almost proved it also.  Ships and boats
had made their way from Bering Strait to the Coppermine.  North of this they had gone from
Baffin Bay through Lancaster Sound and on westward to a great sea called Melville Sound, a
body of water larger than the Irish Sea.  The two lines east and west overlapped widely.  All
that was needed now was to find a channel north and south to connect the two.  This done, the
North-West Passage, the will-o'-the-wisp of three hundred and fifty years, had been found.

A glance at the map will make clear the instructions given to Sir John Franklin.  He was to
go into the Arctic by way of Baffin Bay, and to proceed westward along the parallel of 74°
15' north latitude, which would take him through the already familiar waters of Lancaster Sound
and Barrow Strait, leading into Melville Sound.  This line he was to follow as far as Cape
Walker in longitude 98°, from which point it was known that waters were to be found leading
southward.  Beyond this position Franklin was left to his own {116} discretion, his instructions
being merely to penetrate to the southward and westward in a course as direct to Bering Strait
as the position of the land and the condition of the ice should allow.

The Erebus and the Terror sailed from England on June 19, 1845. The officers and sailors who
manned their decks were the very pick of the Royal Navy and the merchant service, men inured
to the perils of the northern ocean, and trained in the fine discipline of the service. Captain
Crozier of the Terror was second in command.  He had been with Ross in the Antarctic.  Commander
Fitzjames, Lieutenants Fairholme, Gore and others were tried and trained men.  The ships were
so heavily laden with coal and supplies that they lay deep in the water.  Every inch of stowage
had been used, and even the decks were filled up with casks.  A transport sailed with them
across the Atlantic carrying further supplies.  Thus laden they made their way to the Whale
Fish Islands, near Disco, on the west coast of Greenland.  Here the transport unloaded its
stores and set sail for England.  It carried with it five men of Franklin's company, leaving
one hundred and twenty-nine in the ill-fated expedition.

{117}

The ships put out from the coast of Greenland on, or about, July 12, 1845, to make their way
across Baffin Bay to Lancaster Sound, a distance of two hundred and twenty miles.  In these
waters are found the great floes of ice which Davis had first seen, called by Arctic explorers
the 'middle ice.'  The Erebus and the Terror spent a fortnight in attempting to make the passage
across, and here they were seen for the last time at sea.  A whaling ship, the Prince of Wales,
sighted the two vessels on July 26.  A party of Franklin's officers rowed over to the ship
and carried an invitation to the master to dine with Sir John on the next day.  But the boat
had hardly returned when a fine breeze sprang up, and with a clear sea ahead the Erebus and
the Terror were put on their course to the west without even taking time to forward letters
to England.

Thus the two ships vanished into the Arctic ice, never to be seen of Englishmen again.  The
summer of 1845 passed; no news came: the winter came and passed away; the spring and summer
of 1846, and still no message.  England, absorbed in political struggles at home--the Corn
Law Repeal and the vexed question of Ireland--had still no anxiety over Franklin.  No message
could have come except {118} by the chance of a whaling ship or in some roundabout way through
the territories of the Hudson's Bay Company, after all but a slender chance.  The summer of
1846 came and went and then another winter, and now with the opening of the new year, 1847,
the first expression of apprehension began to be heard.  It was remembered how deeply laden
the ships had been.  The fear arose that perhaps they had foundered with all hands in the open
waters of Baffin Bay, leaving no trace behind.  Even the naval men began to shake their heads.
Captain Sir John Ross wrote to the Admiralty to express his fear that Franklin's ships had
been frozen in in such a way that their return was impossible.  The Admiralty took advice.
The question was gravely discussed with the leading Arctic seamen of the day.  It was decided
that until two years had elapsed from the time of departure (May 1845 to May 1847) no measures
need be taken for the relief of the Erebus and the Terror.  The date came and passed.  Anxiety
was deepening.  The Admiralty decided to act. Great stores of pemmican, some eight tons, together
with suitable boats and experienced crews, were sent in June 1847 to Hudson Bay, ready for
an expedition along the northern coast.  A ship {119} was sent with supplies to meet Franklin
in Bering Strait, and two more vessels were strengthened and equipped to be ready to follow
on the track of the Erebus and the Terror in 1848.  As this last year advanced and winter passed
into summer, a shudder of apprehension was felt throughout the nation.  It was felt now that
some great disaster had happened, or even now was happening.  It was known that Franklin's
expedition had carried food for at best three years: the three years had come and gone.  Franklin's
men, if anywhere alive, must be suffering all the horrors of starvation in the frozen fastness
of the Arctic.

We may imagine the awful pictures that rose up before the imagination of the friends and relatives,
the wives and children, of the one hundred and twenty-nine gallant men who had vanished in
the Erebus and the Terror--visions of ships torn and riven by the heaving ice, of men foodless
and shelterless in the driving snow, looking out vainly from the bleak shores of some rocky
coast for the help that never came--awful pictures indeed, yet none more awful than the grim
reality.

A generous frenzy seized upon the nation.  The cry went up from the heart of the people that
Franklin must be found; he and his men {120} must be rescued--they would not speak of them
as dead.  Ships must be sent out with all the equipment that science could devise and the wealth
of a generous nation could supply.  Ships were sent out.  Year after year ships fought their
way from Baffin Bay to the islands of the north.  Ships sailed round the distant Horn and through
the Pacific to Bering Strait.  Down the Mackenzie and the great rivers of the north, the canoes
of the voyageurs danced in the rapids and were paddled swiftly over the wider stretches of
moving water.  Over the frozen snow the sledges toiled against the storm.  And still no word
of Franklin, till all the weary outline of the frozen coast was traced in their wanderings:
till twenty-one thousand miles of Arctic sea and shore had been tracked out.  Thus the great
epic of the search for Franklin ran slowly to its close.  With each year the hope that was
ever deferred made the heart sick.  Anxiety deepened into dread, and even dread gave way to
the cruel certainty of despair.  Not till twelve years had passed was the search laid aside:
not until, little by little, the evidence was found that told all that we know of the fate
of the Erebus and the Terror.

First in the field was Richardson, the gallant {121} friend and comrade of Franklin's former
journeys.  He would not believe that Franklin had failed.  He knew too well the temper of the
man.  Franklin had been instructed to strike southward from the Arctic seas to the American
coast.  On that coast he would be found.  Thither went Sir John Richardson, taking with him
a man of like metal to himself, one John Rae, a Hudson's Bay man, fashioned in the north. 
Down the Mackenzie they went and then eastward along the coast searching for traces of the
Erebus and the Terror.  For two years they searched, tracing their way from the Mackenzie to
the Coppermine.  But no vestige of Franklin did they find.  The queen's ships were searching
too.  Sir James Ross, with the Enterprise and the Investigator, went into Lancaster Sound.
The Plover and the Herald went to Bering Strait.  The North Star went in at Wolstenholme Sound.
The Resolute, the Assistance, the Sophia--a very flock of admiralty ships--spread their white
wings for the Arctic seas.  The Hudson's Bay Company sent Sir John Ross, a tried explorer,
in the yacht Felix.  Lady Franklin, the sorrow-stricken wife of the lost commander, sent out
Captain Forsyth in the Prince Albert.  One Robert Spedden sailed his private yacht, the {122}
Nancy Dawson, in through Bering Strait; and Henry Grinnell of New York (be his name honoured),
sent out two expeditions at his own charge.  By water and overland there went out, between
1847 and 1851, no less than twenty-one expeditions searching for the Erebus and the Terror.

Thus passed six years from the time when Franklin sailed out of the Thames, and still no trace,
no vestige had been found to tell the story of his fate.  Then at last news came, the first
news of the Erebus and the Terror since they were sighted by the whaling ship in 1845. The
news in a way was neither good nor bad.  But it showed that at least the melancholy forebodings
of those who said that the heavily laden ships must have foundered before they reached the
Arctic were entirely mistaken.  Captain Penny, master of the Lady Franklin, had sailed under
Admiralty orders in 1850, and had followed on the course laid down in Franklin's instructions.
He returned in 1851, bringing news that on Beechey Island, a little island lying on the north
side of Barrow Strait, he had found the winter quarters that must have been occupied by the
expedition in 1845-46, the first winter after its departure.  There were the remains of a large
storehouse, {123} a workshop and an observatory; a blacksmith's forge was found, with many
coal bags and cinders lying about, and odds and ends of all sorts, easily identified as coming
from the lost ships.  Most ominous of all was the discovery of over six hundred empty cans
that had held preserved meat, the main reliance of the expedition.  These were found regularly
piled in little mounds.  The number of them was far greater than Franklin's men would have
consumed during the first winter, and, to make the conclusion still clearer, the preparation
was of a brand of which the Admiralty since 1845 had been compelled to destroy great quantities,
owing to its having turned putrid in the tins.  It was plain that the food supply of the Erebus
and the Terror must have been seriously depleted, and the dangers of starvation have set in
long before three years were completed.

Three graves were found on Beechey Island with head-boards marking the names and ages of three
men of the crew who had died in the winter. Near a cape of the island was a cairn built of
stone.  It was evidently intended to hold the records of the expedition.  Yet, strange to say,
neither in the cairn nor anywhere about it was a single document to be found.

{124}

The greatest excitement now prevailed.  Hope ran high that at least some survivors of the men
of the Erebus and the Terror might be found, even if the ships themselves had been lost.  The
Admiralty redoubled its efforts.  Already Captains Collinson and M'Clure had been sent out
(in 1850) to sail round the Horn, and were on their way into the Arctic region via Bering Strait.
To these were now added a squadron under Captain Sir Edward Belcher consisting of the Assistance
with a steam tender named the Pioneer, the Resolute with its tender the Intrepid, and the North
Star.  Stations were to be made at Beechey Island and at two other points in the region now
indicated as the scene of Sir John Franklin's operations.  From these sledge and boat parties
were to be sent out in all directions.  At the same time Lady Franklin dispatched the Albert
under Captain Kennedy and Lieutenant Bellot, an officer of the French navy who had given his
services to the cause.

Once again hope was doomed to disappointment.  The story of the expeditions was an almost unbroken
record of disaster.  Captain M'Clure, in the Investigator, separated from his consort, and
vanished into the northern ice; for three years nothing was heard of his vessel.  {125} The
gallant Bellot, attempting to carry dispatches over the ice, sealed his devotion with his life.
Belcher's ships the Assistance and the Resolute, with their two tenders, froze fast in the
ice.  Despite the earnest protests of some of his officers, Belcher abandoned them, and, in
the end, was able to return home.  The Admiralty had to face the loss of four good ships with
large quantities of stores.  It had been better perhaps had they remained lost.  One of the
abandoned ships, the Resolute, its hatches battened down, floated out of the ice, and was found
by an American whaler, masterless, tossing in the open waters of Baffin Bay.  Belcher may have
been right in abandoning his ships to save the crews, but his judgment and even his courage
were severely questioned, and unhappy bitterness was introduced where hitherto there had been
nothing but the record of splendid endeavour and mutual help.  The only bright spot was seen
in the achievement of Captain, afterwards Sir Robert, M'Clure, who reappeared with his crew
safe and sound after four winters in the Arctic.  He had made his way in the Investigator (1850
to 1853) from Bering Strait to within sight of Melville Sound.  He had spent three winters
in the ice, the last two years in one and the same spot, {126} fast frozen, to all appearances,
for ever.  With supplies dangerously low and his crew weakened by exposure and privation, M'Clure
reluctantly left his ship.  He and his men fortunately reached the ships of Sir Edward Belcher,
having thus actually made the North-West Passage.

The disasters of 1853-54 cast a deeper gloom than ever over the search for Franklin.  Moreover,
the rising clouds in the East and presently the outbreak of the Crimean War prevented further
efforts.  Ships and men were needed elsewhere than in the northern seas.  It began to look
as if failure was now final, and that nothing more could be done. Following naval precedent,
a court-martial had been held to investigate the action of Captain Sir Edward Belcher.  'The
solemn silence,' wrote Captain M'Clure afterwards, 'with which the venerable president of the
court returned Captain Belcher his sword, with a bare acquittal, best conveyed the painful
feelings which wrung the hearts of all professional men upon that occasion; and all felt that
there was no hope of the mystery of Franklin's fate being cleared up in our time except by
some unexpected miracle.'

The unexpected happened.  Strangely enough, {127} it was just at this juncture that a letter
sent by Dr John Rae from the Hudson Bay country brought to England the first authentic news
of the fate of Franklin's men.  Rae had been sent overland from the north-west shores of Hudson
Bay to the coast of the Arctic at the point where the Back or Great Fish river runs in a wide
estuary to the sea.  He had wintered on the isthmus (now called after him) which separates
Regent's Inlet from Repulse Bay, and in the spring of 1854 had gone westward with sledges towards
the mouth of the Back.  On his way he fell in with Eskimos, who told him that several years
before a party of about forty white men had been seen hauling a boat and sledges over the ice.
This was on the west side of the island called King William's Land.  None of the men, so the
savages said, could speak to them in their own language; but they made signs to show that they
had lost their ships, and that they were trying to make their way to where deer could be found.
All the men looked thin, and the Eskimos thought they had very little food. They had bought
some seal's flesh from the savages.  They hauled their sledges and the boat along with drag-ropes,
at which all were tugging except one very tall big man, who seemed to be a chief and {128}
walked by himself.  Later on in the same season, so the Eskimos said, they had found the bodies
of a lot of men lying on the ice, and had seen some graves and five dead bodies on an island
at the mouth of a river.  Some of the bodies were lying in tents.  The big boat had been turned
over as if to make a shelter, and under it were dead men.  One that lay on the island was the
body of the chief; he had a telescope strapped over his shoulders, and his gun lay underneath
him.  The savages told Dr Rae that they thought that the last survivors of the white men must
have been feeding on the dead bodies, as some of these were hacked and mutilated and there
was flesh in the kettles.  There were signs that some of the party might have escaped; for
on the ground there were fresh bones and feathers of geese, showing that the men were still
alive when the wild fowl came north, which would be about the end of May.  There was a quantity
of gunpowder and ammunition lying around, and the Eskimos thought that they had heard shots
in the neighbourhood, though they had seen no living men, but only the corpses on the ice.
A great number of relics--telescopes, guns, compasses, spoons, forks, and so on--were gathered
by the natives, and of these Dr Rae {129} forwarded a large quantity to England.  They left
no doubt as to the identity of the unfortunate victims.  There was a small silver plate engraved
'Sir John Franklin, K.C.B.', and a spoon with a crest and the initials F.R.M.C. (those of Captain
Crozier), and a great number of articles easily recognized as coming from the Erebus and the
Terror.

One may well imagine the intense interest which Dr Rae's discoveries aroused in England.  Rae
had been unable, it is true, to make his way to the actual scene of the disaster as described
by the Eskimos, but it was now felt that at last certain tidings had been received of the death
of Franklin and his men.  Dr Rae and his party received the ten thousand pounds which the government
had offered to whosoever should bring correct news of the fate of the expedition.

In all except a few hearts hope was now abandoned.  It was felt that all were dead.  Anxious
though the government was to obtain further details of the tragedy, it was not thought proper
at such a national crisis as the Crimean War to dispatch more ships to the Arctic. Something,
however, was done.  A chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, named Anderson, was sent overland
in 1855 to explore {130} the mouth of the Back river.  He found in and around Montreal Island,
at the mouth of the river, numerous relics of the disaster.  A large quantity of chips and
shavings seemed to indicate the place where the savages had broken up the boat.  But no documents
or papers were found nor any bodies of the dead.  Anderson had no interpreter, and could only
communicate by signs with the savages whom he found alone on the island.  But he gathered from
them that the white men had all died for want of food.

For two years nothing more was done.  Then, as the war cloud passed away, the unsolved mystery
began again to demand solution.  Some faint hope too struggled to life.  It was argued that
perhaps some of the white men were still alive.  The imagination conjured up a ghastly picture
of a few survivors, still alive when, with the coming of the wild fowl, life and warmth returned.
With what horror must they have turned their backs upon the hideous scene of their sufferings,
leaving the dead as they lay, and preferring to leave unwritten the chronicle of an experience
too awful to relate.  There, penned in between the barren grounds and the sea, they might have
somehow continued to live: there they might still be found.

{131}

It was through the personal efforts of Lady Franklin, who devoted thereto the last remnant
of her fortune, that the final expedition was sent out in 1857.  The yacht Fox was commanded
by Captain M'Clintock. He had already spent many years in the Arctic.  Touched by the poignant
grief of Lady Franklin, he gave his service gratuitously in a last effort to trace the fate
of the missing men.  Other officers gave their services and even money to the search.  The
little Fox sailed in 1857, to search the waters between Beechey Island and the mouth of the
Back.  When she returned to England two years later she brought back with her the first, and
the last, direct information ever received from the Erebus and the Terror.  In a cairn on the
west coast of King William's Island was found a document placed there from Franklin's ships.
It was dated May 28, 1847 (two years after the ships left England).  It read: 'H.M. Ships Erebus
and Terror wintered in the ice lat. 70° 5' N. long., 98° 23' west, having wintered in 1845-46
at Beechey Island after having ascended Wellington Channel to Lat.  All well.'

{132}

This showed that Franklin had, as already gathered, explored the channels west and north from
Lancaster Sound, and finding no way through had wintered on Beechey Island (1845-46).  Striking
south from there his ships had been caught in the open ice-pack, where they had passed their
second winter.  At the time of writing, Franklin must have been looking eagerly forward to
their coming liberation and the prosecution of their discoveries towards the American coast.

But the document did not end there.  It had evidently been placed in the cairn in May of 1847;
a year later the cairn had been reopened and to the document a note had been appended, written
in fine writing round the edge of the original.  The torn edge of the paper leaves part of
the date missing.  It runs '... 848.  H.M. Ships Erebus and Terror were deserted on the 22
of April, 5 leagues NNW. of this ... been beset since 12th Sept. 1846.  The officers and crews
consisting of 105 souls under the command ... tain F. R. M. Crozier landed here in Lat. 69°
37' 42" Long. 98° 41'.'

No words could convey better than these simple lines the full horror of the disaster: two winters
frozen in the ice-pack till the {133} lack of food and the imminence of starvation compelled
the officers and men to leave the ships long before the summer season and try to make their
way over ice and snow to the south!  And Franklin?  He and his party traced out the coast on
both sides of King William's Island, and, having reached the mouth of the Back river, he traced
the course of Crozier and his perishing companions step by step backwards over the scene of
the disaster.  The Eskimos whom he met told him of the freezing in of the two great ships:
how the white men had abandoned them and walked over the ice: how one ship had been crushed
in the ice a few months later and had gone down: and how the other ship {134} had lain a wreck
for years and years beside the coast of King William's Island.  One aged woman who had visited
the scene told M'Clintock's party that there had been on the wrecked ship the dead body of
a tall man with long teeth and large bones.

The searchers themselves found more direct testimony still.  A few miles south of Cape Herschel
lay the skeleton of one of Franklin's men, outstretched on the ground, just as he had fallen
on the fatal march, the head pointing towards the Back river.  At another point there was found
a boat with two corpses in it, the one lying in the stern carefully covered as if by the act
of his surviving comrade, the other lying in the bow, two loaded muskets standing upright beside
the body. A great number of relics that marked the path of Crozier's men were found along the
shore of King William's Island.  In one place a plundered cairn was discovered.  But, strangely
enough, no document or writing to tell anything of the fate of the survivors after they started
on their last march.  That all perished by the way there can be little doubt.  But it is altogether
probable that before the final catastrophe overtook them they had endeavoured to place somewhere
a record of their achievements and their {135} sufferings.  Such a record may still lie buried
among the stones of the desolate region where they died, and it may well be that some day the
chance discovery of an explorer will bring it to light.  But it can tell us little more than
we already know by inference of the tragic but inspiring disaster that overwhelmed the men
of the Erebus and the Terror.

{136}

CHAPTER VI

EPILOGUE.  THE CONQUEST OF THE POLE

It is no part of the present narrative to follow in detail the explorations and discoveries
made in the polar seas in recent times. After the great episode of the loss of Franklin, and
the search for his ships, public interest in the North-West Passage may be said to have ended.
The journey made by Sir Robert M'Clure and his men, after abandoning their ship, had proved
that such a water-way existed, but the knowledge of the northern regions acquired in the attempt
to find the survivors of the Erebus and the Terror made it clear that the passage was valueless,
not merely for commerce, but even for the uses of exploration.  For the time being a strong
reaction set in, and popular opinion condemned any further expenditure of life and money in
the frozen regions of the Arctic.  But, although the sensational aspect of northern discovery
had thus largely disappeared, a new incentive {137} began to make itself increasingly felt;
the progress of physical science, the rapid advance in the knowledge of electricity and magnetism,
and the rise of the science of biology were profoundly altering the whole outlook of the existing
generation towards the globe that they inhabited.  The sea itself, like everything else, became
an object of scientific study.  Its currents and its temperature, its relation to the land
masses which surrounded it, acquired a new importance in the light of geological and physical
research.  The polar waters offered a fruitful field for the new investigations.  In place
of the adventurous explorers of Frobisher's day, searching for fabled empires and golden cities,
there appeared in the seas of the north the inquisitive man of science, eagerly examining the
phenomena of sea and sky, to add to the stock of human knowledge.  Very naturally there grew
up under such conditions an increasing desire to reach the Pole itself, and to test whether
the theoretical conclusions of the astronomer were borne out by the actual observations of
one standing upon the apex of the spinning earth.  The attempt to reach the Pole became henceforth
the great preoccupation of Arctic discovery.  From this time on the story of what has been
done in {138} the northern seas belongs not to Canada but to the world at large.  The voyages
of such men as Frobisher, Davis and Hudson, and the journeys of men like Hearne and Mackenzie
led to the opening up of this vast country and belong to Canadian history.  But in recent Arctic
discovery the point of interest had never been found in the lands about the northern seas,
but only in the Arctic ocean itself and in the effort to penetrate farther and farther north.
Little by little this effort was rewarded.  A series of intrepid explorers forced their way
onward until at last the Pole itself was reached and the frozen North had yielded up its hollow
mystery.

The struggle to reach the Pole was the form in which Arctic exploration came to life again
after the paralysing effect of the Franklin tragedy. Some of the Franklin relief expeditions
had reached very high latitudes, and, shortly after the great tragedy, the exploring ships
of Dr Kane and Dr Hayes, and the Polaris under Captain Hall, had all passed the eightieth parallel
and been within less than ten degrees of the Pole.  The idea grew that there might be an open
polar sea, navigable at times to the very apex of the world.  In 1875 the Alert and the Discovery,
two ships of the British Navy, {139} were sent out with the express purpose of reaching the
North Pole.  They sailed up the narrow waters that separate Greenland from the large islands
lying west of it.  The Alert wintered as far north as latitude 82° 24'.  A sledge party that
was sent out under Captain Markham went as far as latitude 83° 20', and the expedition returned
with the proud distinction of having carried its flag northward beyond all previous explorations.
But other nations were not to lag behind.  An American expedition (1881) under Lieutenant Greeley,
carried on the exploration of the extreme north of Greenland and of the interior of Grinnell
Land that lies west of it.  Two of Greeley's men, Lieutenant Lockwood and a companion, followed
the Greenland coast northward in a sledge and passed Markham's latitude, reaching 83° 24' north,
which remained for many years as the highest point attained.  Greeley's expedition became the
subject of a tragedy almost comparable to the great Franklin disaster.  The vessels sent with
supplies failed to reach their destination.  For four years Greeley and his men remained in
the Arctic regions.  Of the twenty-three men in the party only six were found alive when Captain
Schley of the United States Navy at last brought relief.

{140}

After the Greeley expedition the fight towards the Pole was carried on by a series of gallant
explorers, none of whom, strange to narrate, were British.  Commander R. E. Peary, of the United
States Navy, came prominently before the world as an Arctic navigator in the last decade of
the nineteenth century.  In 1892 he crossed northern Greenland in the extreme latitude of 81°
37', a feat of the highest order.

Still more striking was the work of Dr Fridtjof Nansen, which attracted the attention of the
whole world.  Nansen had devoted profound study to the question of the northern drift of the
polar waters.  It had often been observed that drift-wood and wreckage seemed, in many places,
to float towards the Pole.  Trees that fall in the Siberian forests and float down the great
rivers to the northern sea are frequently found washed up on the shores of Greenland, having
apparently passed over the Pole itself.  A strong current flows northward through Bering Strait,
and it is a matter of record that an American vessel, the Jeanette, which stuck fast in the
ice near Wrangel Land in 1879, drifted slowly northward with the ice for two years, and made
its way in this fashion some four hundred miles towards the {141} Pole.  Dr Nansen formed the
bold design of carrying a ship under steam into one of the currents of the Far North, allowing
it to freeze in, and then trusting to the polar drift to do the rest.  The adventures of Nansen
and his men in this enterprise are so well known as scarcely to need recital.  A stout wooden
vessel of four hundred tons, the Fram (or the Forwards), was specially constructed to withstand
the grip of the polar ice.  In 1893 she sailed from Norway and made her way by the Kara Sea
to the New Siberian Islands.  In October, the Fram froze into the ice and there she remained
for three years, drifting slowly forwards in the heart of the vast mass.  Her rudder and propeller
were unshipped and taken inboard, her engine was taken to pieces and packed away, while on
her deck a windmill was erected to generate electric power.  In this situation, snugly on board
their stout ship, Nansen and his crew settled down into the unbroken night of the Arctic winter.
The ice that surrounded them was twelve feet thick, and escape from it, even had they desired
it, would have been impossible.  They watched eagerly the direction of their drift, worked
out by observation of the stars. For the first few weeks, propelled by northern winds, the
Fram moved southwards.  Then {142} slowly the northern current began to make itself felt, but
during the whole of this first winter the Fram only moved a few miles onward towards her goal.
All the next summer the ship remained fast frozen and drifted about two hundred miles.  With
her rate of progress and direction, Nansen reckoned that she would reach, not the Pole, but
Spitzbergen, and would take four and a half years more to do it.  All through the next winter
the Fram moved slowly northwards and westwards.  In the spring of 1895 she was still about
five hundred miles from the Pole, and her present path would miss it by about three hundred
and fifty miles.  Nansen resolved upon an enterprise unparalleled in hardihood.  He resolved
to take with him a single companion, to leave the Fram and to walk over the ice to the Pole,
and thence as best he might to make his way, not back to his ship again (for that was impossible),
but to the nearest known land.  The whole distance to be covered was almost a thousand miles.
Dr Nansen and Lieutenant Johansen left the Fram on March 13, 1895, to make this attempt.  They
failed in their enterprise.  To struggle towards the Pole over the pack-ice, at times reared
in rough hillocks and at times split with lanes of open water, proved {143} a feat beyond the
power of man.  Nansen and his companion got as far as latitude 86° 13', a long way north of
all previous records.  By sheer pluck and endurance they managed to make their way southward
again.  They spent the winter on an Arctic island in a hut of stone and snow, and in June of
the next year (1896) at last reached Franz Joseph Land, where they fell in with a British expedition.
They reached Norway in time to hear the welcome news that the Fram, after a third winter in
the ice, had drifted into open sea again and had just come safely into port.

Equally glorious, but profoundly tragic, was the splendid attempt of Professor Andrée to reach
the Pole in a balloon, which followed on the heels of Nansen's enterprise.  Andrée, who was
a professor in the Technical School at Stockholm, had been for some years interested in the
rising science of aerial navigation.  He judged that by this means a way might be found to
the Pole where all else failed.  By the generous aid of the king of Sweden, Baron Dickson and
others, he had a balloon constructed in Paris which represented the very latest progress towards
the mastery of the air, in the days before the aeroplane and the light-weight motor had opened
a new chapter in {144} history. Andrée's balloon was made of 3360 pieces of silk sewn together
with three miles of seams.  It contained 158,000 cubic feet of hydrogen; it carried beneath
it a huge wicker basket that served as a sort of house for Andrée and his companions, and to
the netting of this were lashed provisions, sledges, frame boats, and other appliances to meet
the needs of the explorers if their balloon was wrecked on the northern ice.  There was no
means of propulsion, but three heavy guide ropes, trailing on the ground, afforded a feeble
and uncertain control.  The whole reliance of Andrée was placed, consciously and with full
knowledge of the consequences, on the possibility that a strong and favouring wind might carry
him across the Pole.  The balloon was taken on shipboard to Spitzbergen and there inflated
in a tall shed built for the purpose.  Andrée was accompanied by two companions, Strindberg
and Fraenkel.  On July 11, 1897, the balloon was cast loose, and, with a southerly wind and
bright sky, it was seen to vanish towards the north. It is known, from a message sent by a
pigeon, that two days later all was well and the balloon still moving towards its goal.  Since
then no message or token has ever been found to tell us the fate of the three brave men, and
{145} the names of Andrée and his companions are added to the long list of those who have given
their lives for the advancement of human knowledge.

With the opening of the present century the progress of polar exploration was rapid.  Peary
continued his explorations towards the north of Greenland, and, in 1906, by reaching latitude
87° 6', he wrested from Nansen the coveted record of Farthest North.  At the same time Captain
Sverdrup (the commander of the Fram), the Duke of the Abruzzi and many others were carrying
out scientific expeditions in polar waters.  The voyage made in 1904 by Captain Roald Amundsen,
a Norwegian, later on to be world-famous as the discoverer of the South Pole, is of especial
interest, for he succeeded in carrying his little ship from the Atlantic to the Pacific by
way of Bering Strait--the only vessel that has ever actually made the North-West Passage. 
But the great prize fell to Captain Peary.  On September 6, 1909, the world thrilled with the
announcement that Peary had reached the Pole.  His ship, the Roosevelt, had sailed in the summer
of 1908.  Peary wintered at Etah in the north of Greenland, and in the ensuing year, accompanied
by Captain Bartlett with five white men and {146} seventeen Eskimos, he set out to reach the
Pole by sledge.  By arrangement, Peary's companions accompanied him a certain distance carrying
supplies, and then turned back in successive parties.  The final dash for the Pole was made
by the commander himself, accompanied only by a negro servant and four Eskimos.  On April 6,
1909, they reached the Pole and hoisted there the flag of the United States.  To make doubly
certain of their discovery, Peary and his men went some ten miles beyond the Pole, and eight
miles in a lateral direction.  They saw nothing but ice about them, and no indication of the
neighbourhood of any land.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

For the earlier voyages of the English to the Northern seas the first and principal authority
is, of course, the famous collection of contemporary narratives gathered together by Richard
Hakluyt under the title, Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, and Discoveries of the
English Nation.  Here the reader will find accounts of the enterprises of Frobisher, Davis,
and others as written by members of the expeditions and persons closely connected therewith.
An interesting presentation of the exploits of Hudson, as revealed in original documents, is
found in Henry Hudson, the Navigator, published by the Hakluyt Society.  The journal of Samuel
Hearne, together with many maps and much interesting material, is to be found among the publications
of the Champlain Society, (Toronto, 1911) ably edited and annotated by the well-known explorer
Mr J. B. Tyrrell. Alexander Mackenzie's own account of his voyages is a classic, and is readily
accessible in public libraries.  An account of Mackenzie's career is found in the 'Makers of
Canada' series.  Sir John Franklin left behind him a very graphic description of his first
journey to the polar seas, to which {148} reference has already been made in the text. For
the story of the loss of Franklin and the search for his missing ships the reader may best
consult the works of Sir John Richardson, and others who participated in the events of the period.
