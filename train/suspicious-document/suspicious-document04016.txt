"An enterprising Spaniard of St. Louis, Manuel Lisa, sent out the party; an acquaintance and
old friend of the Senator from Wisconsin who sits on my left [General Henry Dodge] led the
party--his name Andrew Henry. He was the first man that saw that pass; and he found it in the
prosecution of his business, that of a hunter and trader, and by following the game and the
road which they had made. And that is the way all passes are found. But these traders do not
write books and make maps, but they enable other people to do it."[257]

Benton errs in thinking that the hunter was the pioneer in Kentucky. As I have shown, the trader
opened the way. But Benton is at least valid authority upon the Great West, and his fundamental
thesis has much truth in it. A continuously higher life flowed into the old channels, knitting
the United States together into a complex organism. It is a process not limited to America.
In every country the exploitation of the wild beasts,[258] and of the raw products generally,
causes the entry of the disintegrating and transforming influences of a higher civilization.
"The history of commerce is the history of the intercommunication of peoples."

desire, in January and February of 1788, Washington wrote various letters inquiring as to the
feasibility of a canal between Lake Erie and the Ohio, "whereby the fur and peltry of the upper
country can be transported"; saying: "Could a channel once be opened to convey the fur and
peltry from the Lakes into the eastern country, its advantages would be so obvious as to induce
an opinion that it would in a short time become the channel of conveyance for much the greater
part of the commodities brought from thence." Sparks, Washington's Works, IX., 303, 327.]
