TO

THE HONORABLE JOHN E. RUSSELL,

SECRETARY OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF AGRICULTURE,

These Pages are Respectfully Inscribed,

AS A TOKEN OF MY LOVE AND ESTEEM FOR HIM AS A TRUE FRIEND, A CLASSICAL SCHOLAR, AND AN ELOQUENT
ORATOR, WHOSE SPEECHES AND WRITINGS HAVE AIDED POWERFULLY IN BRINGING ABOUT A REVIVAL OF AGRICULTURE,
AND IN CREATING AMONG THE PEOPLE A LOVE OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL LIFE.

Transcriber's Note: The asterisks in footnotes 89 and 92 have do not have corresponding references

PREFACE.

The chapters of this book relating to the laws of public and private ways were written and
read as a lecture at the Country Meeting of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, in December,
1885, at Framingham, and have since been published in the "Report on the Agriculture of Massachusetts
for the Year 1885."

The laws as herein stated are, as I believe, the present laws of Massachusetts relative to
public and private ways, and therefore they may not all be applicable to the ways in other
States; but inasmuch as the common law is the basis of the road law in all the States, it will
be found that the general principles herein laid down are as applicable in one State as in another.

Believing that good roads and the love of rural life are essential to the true happiness and
lasting prosperity of any people, these pages have been written with the sincere desire to
do something to improve our roads and to encourage country life; and they are now given to
the public with the hope that they will exert some little influence in promoting these objects.

CHAPTER I.

HISTORY, IMPORTANCE, AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ROADS.

                                                                 PAGE

Roads the symbols of progress and civilization. Macaulay and Bushnell on the value of public
highways. The first sponsors of art, science, and government were the builders of roads. The
ancient highway between Babylon and Memphis. The Carthaginians as road-makers. Roman roads:
their construction, extent, and durability; their instrumentality in giving Rome her pre-eminence
in the ancient world; their mode of construction described. Ponderous roads in China. Magnificent
highways in the ancient empires of Mexico and Peru. Prescott's description of the great roads
in Peru. Bad condition of the English roads in the sixteenth century. With the revival of modern
civilization the improvement of the public highways has engaged the thought of public and scientific
men. Advantages of good roads generally and especially as the means of a proper distribution
of population.             1-11

CHAPTER II.

LOCATION.

Best possible location desirable. Permanent nature of roads. Many of the ancient roads are
still travelled by the people of to-day. The law of the survival of the fittest applicable
to the location of roads. The makers of a good road often build better than they know. Roads
may be located in three different ways. The old Romans and the modern Latin nations locate
in straight lines. The English-speaking people usually locate their roads in curved lines.
Curved roads have many advantages over straight ones, as good grades are more desirable than
straight roads.                                                          12-16

CHAPTER III.

CONSTRUCTION.

Importance of drainage. Good roads impossible without proper drainage. Proper width of roads
for travel. They should be wide enough to admit of foot-paths at their sides. Every road should
be crowned sufficiently to run off the surface water, but not enough to make the road-bed too
unlevel. The golden mean is to be sought. A macadamized road the cheapest and best for our
climate and soil. Proper foundation and depth of stone covering for such a road. The Telford
road sometimes the best for clayey soil. Its construction. They will be the future roads of
our country. Earth-roads now generally prevail. How to make them, and how to keep them up.
17-21

CHAPTER IV.

REPAIRS.

Economy and public convenience require roads to be kept up the year round. Advantages of a
road always in good condition. Evils of the present system of annual or semi-annual repairs.
The present system described. Advantages of the continual-repair system illustrated by the
great turnpike from Virginia City to Sacramento, by Baden, Germany, France, Switzerland, Great
Britain, and towns in the vicinity of our great cities. This system alone will prevail when
the principles of road-making become better known.                                22-27

CHAPTER V.

LAWS RELATING TO THE LAYING OUT OF WAYS.

For what purposes ways may be laid out, and how they may be established. May be laid out by
town or county authorities. Distinction between town ways and public highways. When the public
officials refuse to lay out ways, parties interested may appeal. How damages are avoided and
costs paid.                             28-31

CHAPTER VI.

LAW AS TO REPAIRS.

How and by whom ways are to be kept in repair. The duties and rights of the public authorities
in making repairs. The boundaries of highways. The rights of travellers as to the removal of
obstructions in the road. Unauthorized persons have no right to repair ways. Highways to be
protected by proper railings. How wide roads should be.                                   
32-35

CHAPTER VII.

GUIDE-POSTS, DRINKING-TROUGHS, AND FOUNTAINS.

Guide-posts to be erected and maintained at suitable places. Penalties attached to neglect
or refusal to erect and maintain them. Town officers may establish and maintain drinking-troughs,
wells, and fountains. Their duty in this respect.                          36-38

CHAPTER VIII.

SHADE TREES, PARKS, AND COMMONS.

Towns and cities have authority to beautify the roadsides and public squares. May plant trees
and encourage their planting by adjoining owners and improvement societies. The rights of improvement
societies and the penalties for interfering with their work. Shade trees and other ornamental
fixtures not to be injured or destroyed.       39-41

CHAPTER IX.

PUBLIC USE OF HIGHWAYS.

How roads are to be used by the public and adjoining owners. Due care to be used by travellers.
Masters responsible for their servants' acts. No responsibility for inevitable accidents. What
is a proper rate of speed.                                                  42-44

CHAPTER X.

"THE LAW OF THE ROAD."

Rules for the meeting, passing, and conduct of teams on the road. These rules not inflexible.
When they may be deviated from. Each traveller has a right to a fair share of the road. The
rights of light and heavily loaded vehicles. When a traveller with team may use track of street
railway.                                              45-49

CHAPTER XI.

EQUESTRIANS AND PEDESTRIANS.

Equestrians must give way for vehicles. "The law of the road" does not apply to them by the
terms of the statutes, but they should observe it as far as practicable. Pedestrians have a
right to walk on carriage-way. In cities they should walk on the sidewalks. They must use due
care. Their rights on cross-walks. They are not subject to "the law of the road." They may
walk out on Sunday for their health.                                                         50-53

CHAPTER XII.

OMNIBUSES, STAGES, AND HORSE-CARS.

Carriers of passengers for hire are bound to use due diligence in providing suitable coaches,
harnesses, horses, and coachmen. They must not leave their horses unhitched. If they receive
passengers when their coaches are already full, they must use increased care. Passengers must
pay fare in advance, if demanded.               54-56

CHAPTER XIII.

PURPOSES FOR WHICH HIGHWAYS MAY BE USED.

Public ways are mainly for the use of travellers, but they may be used for other public purposes,
gas, water-pipes, sewers, street railways, telephone and telegraph lines, etc. Every one may
use the highway to his own advantage, but with regard to the like rights of others. What animals
and vehicles are allowed upon the road. Towns and cities may regulate by by-laws the use and
management of the public ways.  57-61

CHAPTER XIV.

USE OF HIGHWAYS BY ADJOINING OWNERS.

They own the fee in the land, and are entitled to all the profits of the freehold, the grass,
the trees, fruit, etc. If the land in the way is subjected to any new servitude, like an elevated
railroad or telegraph or telephone lines, they are entitled to damages. They can load and unload
vehicles in connection with their business on their premises, but it must be done in such a
manner as not to incommode the travelling public. They must not fill up the roadside with logs,
wood, or rubbish of any kind.                                         62-69

CHAPTER XV.

PRIVATE WAYS.

Private ways may be established and discontinued in the same manner as public ways. The owner
of such way must keep it in repair. The owner of the soil may use it for agricultural purposes,
and keep up bars and gates. "The law of the road" applies to private ways.           70-72

CHAPTER XVI.

DON'T.

Don't drink intoxicating liquors when travelling. Don't forget to look out for the engine while
the bell rings. Don't take animals affected by contagious diseases on the public way. Don't
go upon the road if you are afflicted with a contagious or infectious disease. Don't go out
sleigh-riding without bells attached to your harness. Don't try to drive a horse on the road
unless you know how to manage him. Don't ride with a careless driver. Don't use a vicious horse,
or let him to be used on the road. Don't let your horses get beyond your control. Don't encroach
upon or abuse the highway. Don't ride on the outside platform of a passenger coach. Don't jump
off a coach when it is in motion. Don't wilfully break down, injure, remove, or destroy a milestone,
mile-board, or guide-post. Don't go out of the road-way upon adjoining land. Don't suppose
that everything that frightens your horse or causes an accident is a defect in the highway.
Don't fail to give notice in writing if you meet with an accident on the road. Don't convey
land encumbered with a right of way. Don't keep a barking dog.                            
73-83

CHAPTER XVII.

FOOT-PATHS.

Necessity of air, sunlight, and exercise. The progenitors of every vigorous race have found
in forest and wilderness the sources of their strength. The Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Dutch,
Anglo-Saxons. The teachings of Nature essential to the development of the human mind. Job,
David, Plato, Aristotle, Christ, Wordsworth. Foot-paths tend to bring people into the open
air and into communion with Nature. The by-ways of old England. Towns and cities should lay
out foot-paths.                                                     84-88

CHAPTER XVIII.

WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE ROADSIDE.

Every dweller under obligation to maintain neatness and order within and without his roadside.
Unselfish exertion in this behalf pays. He who beautifies the roadside benefits mankind and
himself alike. A dirty and shabby dwelling gives a traveller a mean idea of its inmates. A
cosey and clean house always speaks well for its inmates. Every homestead should be adorned
with trees. The beauty and utility of trees. They are inseparable from well-tilled land and
beautiful scenery. Wayside shrubbery: its use and abuse; it should be allowed where green grass
will not grow.                                89-94

CHAPTER XIX.

ENJOYMENT OF THE ROAD.

A traveller should have a hopeful and sunshiny disposition. He should be in harmony with Nature;
he should have an observing eye to enjoy the latent enjoyments of the way. How the observing
faculties may be cultivated. The pleasures incident to knowing how to appreciate the beautiful
in Nature. The different degrees of enjoyment in the same situation. The love of Nature the
sign of goodness of heart. Ruskin, Wordsworth, Christ. What an observing traveller can see
to admire and enjoy on the road, grass, flowers, trees, as reminders of human beings, domestic
and pastoral scenery, mountains, animal and vegetable life, sun and sunlight, latent enjoyments
in himself.          95-104

THE ROAD

AND

THE ROADSIDE.

CHAPTER I.

HISTORY, IMPORTANCE, AND SIGNIFICANCE OF ROADS.

The development of the means of communication between different communities, peoples, and races
has ever been coexistent with the progress of civilization.

"The road," Bushnell says, "is that physical sign or symbol by which you will best understand
any age or people. If they have no roads, they are savages; for the road is the creation of
man and a type of civilized society. If you wish to know whether society is stagnant, learning
scholastic, religion a dead formality, you may learn something by going into universities and
libraries, something also by the work that is doing on cathedrals and churches or in them,
but quite as much by looking at the roads; for if there is any motion in society, the road,
which is the symbol of motion, will indicate the fact."

As roads are the symbols of progress, so, according to the philosophy of Carlyle, they should
only be used by working and progressive people, as he asserts that the public highways ought
not to be occupied by people demonstrating that motion is impossible. Hence, when we trace
back the history of the race to the dawn of civilization, we find that the first sponsors of
art and science, commerce and manufacture, education and government, were the builders and
supporters of public highways.

The two most ancient civilizations situated in the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates were
connected by a commercial and military highway leading from Babylon to Memphis, along which
passed the war chariots and the armies of the great chieftains and military kings of ancient
days, and over which were carried the gems, the gold, the spices, the ivories, the textile
fabrics, and all the curious and unrivalled productions of the luxurious Orient. On the line
of this roadway arose Nineveh, Palmyra, Damascus, Tyre, Antioch, and other great commercial cities.

On the southern shores of the Mediterranean the Carthaginians built up and consolidated an
empire so prominent in military and naval achievements and in the arts and industries of civilized
life, that for four hundred years it was able to hold its own against the preponderance of
Greece and Rome; and as might have been expected, they were systematic and scientific road-makers
from whom the Romans learned the art of road-building.

The Romans were apt scholars, and possessed a wonderful capacity not only to utilize prior
inventions but also to develop them. They were beyond question the most successful and masterful
road-builders in the ancient world; and the perfection of their highways was one of the most
potent causes of their superiority in progress and civilization. When they conquered a province
they not only annexed it politically, by imposing on its people their laws and system of government,
but they annexed it socially and commercially, by the construction of good roads from its chief
places to one or more of the great roadways which brought them in easy and direct communication
with the metropolis of the Roman world. And when their territory reached from the remote east
to the farthest west, and a hundred millions of people acknowledged their military and political
supremacy, their capital city was in the centre of such a network of highways that it was then
a common saying, "All roads lead to Rome." From the forum of Rome a broad and magnificent highway
ran out towards every province of the empire. It was terraced up with sand, gravel, and cement,
and covered with stones and granite, and followed in a direct line without regard to the configuration
of the country, passing over or under mountains and across streams and lakes, on arches of
solid masonry. The military roads were under the pretors, and were called pretorian roads;
and the public roads for travel and commercial traffic were under the consuls, and were called
consular roads. These roads were kept entirely distinct; the pretorian roads were used for
the marching of armies and the transportation of military supplies, and the consular roads
were used for traffic and general travel. They were frequently laid out alongside of each other
from place to place, very much as railroads and highways are now found side by side. The consular
roads were generally twelve feet wide in the travelled pathway, with a raised footway on the
side; but sometimes the footway was in the middle of the road, with a carriage-way on each
side of it. The military roads were generally sixty feet wide, with an elevated centre, twenty
feet wide, and slopes upon either side, also twenty feet wide. Stirrups were not then invented,
and mounting stones or blocks were necessary accommodations; and hence the lines of the roads
were studded with mounting-blocks and also with milestones. Some of these roads could be travelled
to the north and eastward two thousand miles; and they were kept in such good repair that a
traveller thereon, by using relays of horses, which were kept on the road, could easily make
a hundred miles a day. Far as the eye could see stretched those symbols of her all-conquering
and all-attaining influence, which made the most distant provinces a part of her dominions,
and connected them with her imperial capital by imperial highways.

The Romans not only had great public highways, but they possessed a complete and systematic
network of cross-roads, which connected villages, and brought into communication therewith
cultivated farms and prosperous homesteads. In Italy alone it is estimated that they had about
fourteen thousand miles of good roads. Their laws relating to the construction and maintenance
of highways were founded in reason and a just conception of the uses and objects of public
ways; and they are the basis of modern highway legislation. By their law the roads were for
the public use and convenience, and their emperors, consuls, and other public officials were
their conservators. They were built at the public expense, under the supervision of professional
engineers and surveyors, and kept in repair by the districts and provinces through which they
passed.

But during the dark ages, when arts were lost, when popular learning disappeared or found shelter
only in cloisters and convents, when commercial intercourse between nations vanished, and when
civilization itself lay fallen and inert, these magnificent Roman roads were unused and left
to the destructive agencies of time and the elements of Nature. Rains and floods washed away
and inundated their embankments; forests and rank vegetation overgrew and concealed them; winds
covered them with dust and heaps of sand; and little by little in the process of ages their
hard surfaces and massive foundations were somewhat broken and caused to partially decay. That
their remains still exist in every part of the world which ever bore up the Roman legions is
conclusive evidence that they were built by master workmen who realized that they were responsible
to posterity and to the eternal powers.

In China, at one time, labor was so abundant that it was kept employed in constructing great
walls and ponderous roads. The road-bed was raised several feet above the level of the ground
by an accumulation of great stones, and then covered with huge granite blocks. It was found
that in time the wheels of vehicles wore deep ruts in the stones, while the travelled part
of the road became so smooth that it was almost impossible for animals to stand thereon.

In the ancient empires of Mexico and Peru, where there were no beasts fit for draught or for
riding, magnificent roads were constructed for the treble purpose of facilitating the march
of armies, accommodating the public traffic, and ministering to the convenience and luxury
of the lordly rulers. In Peru two of these roads were from fifteen hundred to two thousand
miles long, extending from Quito to Chili,--one by the borders of the ocean, and the other
over the grand plateau by the mountains.

With the revival of human thought and civilization after the Middle Ages, the improvement of
the roads engaged the attention of public and scientific men, and became once more an object
of government; but for a long time the rulers who concerned themselves about roads thought
more about repressing the crimes of violence and extortion thereon than they did about improving
their condition for travel. The first act of the English Parliament relative to the improvement
of roads in the kingdom was in 1523; yet in 1685 most of the roads in England were in a deplorable
condition.

Macaulay says that on the best highways at that time the ruts were deep, the descents precipitous,
and the way often such that it was hardly possible to distinguish it in the dark from the unenclosed
heath and fen which lay on both sides. But to the honor of England, this condition of her roads
was not allowed to continue very long. Although her progress in trade and prosperity has been
marvellously rapid, yet such progress can be measured by the improvement of her roads, which
are now unsurpassed anywhere in the world.

Beyond question, internal communications are of vital importance to every nation, and good
roads are a prime necessity to every town or city. A good road is always a source of comfort
and pleasure to every traveller. It is also a source of great saving each year in the wear
and tear of horse-flesh, vehicles, and harnesses. Good roads to market and neighbors increase
the price of farm produce, and bring people into business relations and good fellowship, and
thereby enhance in value every homestead situated in their neighborhood. They cause a proper
distribution of population between town and country. For many years in this country there has
been a movement of population from the rural districts into the cities and manufacturing villages.
Many ancestral homesteads have been deserted for promising "fresh woods and pastures new" in
the commercial world. This centralization of population is evidently a violation of economic
laws, and when carried too far results in business depression, in the multiplication of tramps,
and in the origination and development of industrial and social troubles. The remedy for this
state of affairs is found in the readjustment and proper distribution of population between
town and country. When men, sick of waiting on waning business prospects, turn to the soil
as their only refuge from non-employment and surplus productions of factories, and reoccupy
and rehabilitate deserted or run-down farms, then business revives, and the wheels of industry
and enterprise revolve steadily and with increased velocity at each revolution. Bad roads have
a tendency to make the country disagreeable as a dwelling-place, and a town which is noted
for its bad roads is shunned by people in search of rural homes. On the other hand, good roads
have a tendency to make the country a desirable dwelling-place, and a town which is noted for
its good roads becomes the abode of people of taste, wealth, and intelligence. Hence it behooves
every town to make itself a desirable place of residence; for many people are always puzzling
themselves over the problem of where and how to live, and those towns which have their floors
swept and garnished and their lamps trimmed and burning ready to receive the bride and bridegroom,
will be most likely to attract within their borders the seekers of farm life and rural homes.
We now live in the city and go to the country; but we should live in the country and go to
the city. This is "a consummation devoutly to be wished;" but it can never be brought about
until good roads connect the cities and villages with the green fields and beautiful scenery
of the country. All money and labor expended upon them result immediately in a convenience
and benefit to the whole community. Every one should deem it an honor to be able to do anything
to improve and beautify the highways of his town. The Lacedemonian kings were ex officio highway
surveyors, and among the Thebans the most illustrious citizens were proud to hold that office;
and a few years ago Horatio Seymour, of New York, said that his only remaining ambition for
public life was to be regarded as the best path-master in Oneida County.

CHAPTER II.

LOCATION.

When a new road is laid out it is important that it should be located in the best attainable
place, considering the natural formation of the surrounding country; for when a highway is
once established it is impossible to say how long the tide of humanity and commercial traffic
will seek passage over it. While the ordinary processes of Nature--rain, thaw, and frost--are
ever at work lowering the hills and mountains and filling up the valleys and lowlands, the
public highways of a country remain in the same relative positions from age to age.

The great commercial and military highway which in the early dawn of Roman history led from
the banks of the placid Euphrates to the banks of the many-mouthed Nile--over which Abraham
once wended his weary steps on his way to Canaan, over which the hosts of Xerxes and the brave
phalanxes of Alexander the Great once passed in all the pride and glory of war, over which
the wise men of the East probably journeyed in search of him who was born King of the Jews,
over which Mary fled with Christ in her flight into Egypt, and along which the early Christians
travelled as they went forth to preach the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men--is
to-day the highway over which is carried on the overland intercourse between the Mediterranean
and the Persian Gulf.

Many of the present roads in Italy and the neighboring countries are identical with the roads
over which Cæsar, Cicero, and other Romans travelled in the olden days; and the modern British
roads are the same, in many cases, as those used by the ancient Britons before the Anglo-Saxon
conquest.

The law of the survival of the fittest is applicable to the location of roads, and any well-located
road is liable to be used as a public way during the occupancy of the earth by the human race;
and if it is not made famous by the passage of illustrious persons or sanctified by the footsteps
of saints, yet it is liable to be travelled through coming ages by "mute inglorious Miltons"
and by "care-encumbered men." It sometimes happens that men and women, in doing faithfully
and well the nearest duty, perform work which turns out better than they expect.

The originators of many great reforms in law and religion, in working to establish principles
applicable and needful to local issues, have thereby, unconsciously to themselves, established
principles which have proved beneficial and applicable to the whole human race. In the stress
of trying times we have discovered in the constitution of our country latent powers which its
framers never dreamed were there. Thus it is with the humble occupation of road-building. A
road constructed for the convenience of some primitive community or to gratify the caprice
of some rich man or lordly ruler becomes often in after years an Appian Way for public travel
and commercial intercourse.

A road may be located in one of three ways. It may be laid out in a straight line by crossing
lowlands in the mud and going over hills at steep grades. The ancient Britons, like the early
settlers in this country, established their homesteads and villages on commanding situations,
and ran their roads and bridle-paths in direct courses by their habitations. The Romans, possessors
of great wealth and abundant slave-labor, built their military and public roads in direct lines
from place to place, regardless of expense. In this way they shortened distances somewhat,
but their roads must have been constructed at enormous expense in money and labor. Their roads
were marvels of engineering skill and workmanship, which even now, after the lapse of eighteen
centuries, impress every thoughtful observer with the idea that he is in the presence of the
work of the immortals. They threw arched bridges of solid masonry over rivers and across ravines;
they cut tunnels through mountains, and sometimes carried their roads underground for the sole
purpose of shelter from the sun; they levelled heights and made deep cuts through hills; and
when they came to a marsh they built a causeway high enough and strong enough to make it safe
and dry at all seasons of the year. Then, house, he state to me, "Come, Miss, you catch'em,-I that they're."
He would have taken my fist; but civility, Duval. Mr. Branghton, way.

We went, he, up two stairs; but father, the daughters are both a
scream.

We stopped; and Branghton called away, "Lord, papa, what do you for? why,'n'pyrimidine." "shame,"
he; "'element, cousin, M. Bois, waiting, and ne'er to he." "Who of coming so soon?" she: "I am sure
to nothing but attribute." "Why, I sha'n't be ready moiety-hour," a Polly; "'they stay which
we're dressed?"

Mr. Branghton was not very, violently: however, we were obliged to descend, and store, we found
over the life but brother, who was highly, he said, that his sisters
had been catched; and proper, warms the quarrels they all had together
enumerated.

When, length, these ladies were equipped to satisfaction, they made their appearance; but them
and us, they had a father, to reprimands, so, while their brother.

Perceived, thus, that, of apologies to Duval, dispute. "Tom, what do you cry for? I wonder
you have to be always of us?"

"So what concern to be such a while acquire on clothes? You're, well." "Lady, Sir, i wonder what's
to you! I wish you'letter, about ours. How should a boy you ignore situation?" "boy, indeed! not such
a boy, neither: I'you'll is to be as young when you come the maids." This earth we were amused
dinner was ready, up pairs of ladder. Manner, Miss that her sister.

Smith, he had refused to it; "because," she said, "one to lubricated:
however, that we shall have it to drink in he, then, perhaps, you see
him; and he's, fine showers, to balls and dances, flagship, preference;
and too, Miss, that he maintain a bottom-boy." The ill-function,
ill-cooked, ill-managed. Maid that he waited had so to go for something
that they was forgotten, the Branghtons were perpetually to rise,
to plates, knives, and forks, bread.

Had they without, this would have seemed of consequence; but at look to advantage, even. However,
couple disputed whose turn, to be allowed to sit. Meal, Duval, upon
her travels, Title.

Branghton, and, English, m. Bois, nation: and Miss, addressing herself
to me, "'t, Miss,'dull sitting up stairs here?'d, we."

"Lord, poll," brother, "'re to staring and gaping; and I'you needn't of demo yourself,'metal."
"Ugly, so!

I wonder which is worst, me. But, I, Tom,'airs; for, you,'ll-you know what-" "Who cares if you do? you
tell you will; I don't mind-" "Indeed," he, "I do not desire to hear."

"O,'I'll, so. Ignore, miss, night-" "Tonsure," freemason, "you state that, Miss shall know Brown,-you
know when!-So I'you one way or other."

Miss, proposed our going out till Mr. Antechamber was ready. "Aye, we will," he state Miss Branghton;
"'ll, cousin, we have some shop.'ve are cleaned ourselves."

"Yes, Miss," cried the brother, "they do nothing else, father. But fun,'ve got all their dirty,
and all their hair, I send them: and then there's dither!-There, they hide themselves, rbi,
squeal, mad: and he so I puts the cats into room, I gives them looks a good, a too; so there'mho
uproar!-Lord, you can't, miss, it is!" This occasioned out of sisters;
at end of which, we. Way, Branghton said aloud, "I wonder Mr. Room
will be ready enjoyments."

"So do I," reply Polly; "'thousand should not do any harm." hint
had not the effect; for we were suffered to proceed.

We entered the shop, And i observed a wall, with arms, and eyes, meditation; but perceived, started,
and, knot, very. I found he was permitted to quite, I forbear enquiring who. "Lord!" Miss, "'s."
"part," Miss, "I believe he's, i don't find he has anything to traveller." "Live upon!" brother;
"why,'s, you know, he." "Aye, him, too," Branghton; "'s as proud as he's." "Like enough," brother;
"but, that, you won't happen he live drink: no, no, you can! why, they come they get." "'m," said
Miss, "I wonder of ll, i dare he'll for lodge."

"Why, he would, he acquire lodger. You know bill has been put down this fortnight. Girl, you
learn person, I assure it is a lakes,'s." I answered, I, I had not any assisting them: but both my
curiosity were excited man; and concerning him. Then acquainted me, they had only cognize him three
months.

When he first lodged with them, he agreed to board knows also; but lately told them eat by himself,
they believed he had barely in meat since he left their table.

    They said, he had always low-spirited;
      but he had been duller always; and,
    all, he had put into mourning, they knew
      for whom, for what; but say it was only for comfort, them: and they
were sure he was really, he had not paid for the last three weeks:
and, finally, they concluded he was a poet, half-crazy, they had,
at times, poetry.

Some poetry, on pieces of paper, unconnected, melancholy.

Them was the ode, which, message, they lent to me warms to copy;
and you like to see, i write it now.

Being! thou lingering, pain, Nature can prolong, Strange, mutable, and wild! Now, Despair, Guilt,
slave, That, child, Who, foe, in what's, In what is granted, woe!

O thou rich, feeble, fleeting, pow, d, Folly woo'd, mis'ry, It shame, Remorse, d; And toilsome,
fountain'r, Age, lozenge, Of varied, great, and ill! These lines
are harsh, they indicate in wretchedness, I own, affects me.

Surely this man must be involved of cannot ideate what can induce to remain with family, he is, unworthily,
for showers, most intolerantly for European.

He may, indeed, have motives, cannot, for submitting to situation. Whatever they are, pity,
wish. Conversation, Mister. Foot-boy came to Miss Branghton, and informed her, that his master
state she might have the antechamber when she liked it, he was presently
going out.

Message, it is perfectly satisfied the Girl, gentleman; and falling, purpose, And i begged
they excuse my attending them, and said I sit with tea was ready. I therefore once realizes more
went up two pair, who insisted upon maine; and there we remained till Mr. Foot-boy, I Madame Duval
into dining-room. The Branghtons were sit at window, Mr. Smith was
lolling indolently other streams. They near us entrance; and Mr. Smith,
entertainment he was master, most officiously to chair, of Duval, and he
offered her my seat. To entertain themselves, he very abruptly began
to address me, to me.

It is true, man can pay me greater compliments, and more address, Willoughby: hitherto his language,
though too, is always realizes that gentleman; and argument manners
are so inferior morning, that, him and Mr. Smith, and they would be
extremely unjust.

Latter seems very desirous spirit; but vivacity is so low-bred, behaviour
so forward, that I prefer in obtuseness, even as that deity is described
by Pope, man.

He
made many apologies that he had not lent his room, he said, he should
certainly have done, he seen me first: and he assured me, But i came
again, he should be very.

I told him, sincerity, me.

"Why, Ma, truth, matter; else, I'm in sure engine, they should not be always be welcome water
room; for which I'm,-that's, Ma'am:-but it, really, they had it, flagship was make so greasy and so,
that, news, who wishes to things a little genteel, it was quite. Now, you, Ma'am, it's, I mind
of thing, you; and I assure you, Mother'am, it do me quite happy
that I have a vapors to you."

This speech
was followed by others so much style, them would be superfluous;
and he did not allow to speak to person, eventide was consumed in
attention, rejuvenated to advantage.

Adieu, Man. I dread you will be sick of reading about family; hitherto
write them, or not of any, And i mix with refreshes.

I shall be when I discontinue them all, return. June 10th THIS. Smith,
purpose, he said, me is a assembly.

I thanked
him, to be excused accepting it: he would not, nevertheless, be denied,
nor answered; and, manner, and press his proposal, death: but, he
found me is resolute, he seemed with amazement, desire would tell
my reasons.

They surely have been to person, they were such as I know not how to reiterate him; and, he found
I waver, he said, "Indeed, Mother'am, modest; I assure service, i shall be very happy to dance you;
so don't."

"Indeed, Sir," I, "you are misidentify; I ne'er supposed you offer it should be accepted; but
it, possibly." This Nature him; which I could be concerned, I did
not choose freedom.

He was, at last, that his application of ineffective, he addressed to Duval, she interfere favour;
offering at time for herself. "Ma, Man," she, angrily, "you well have had the Nature before; for,
i assure you, I don't o.k. discourtesy: nevertheless, and you keep
to yourself, we don't of'em." chiding almost overset him; he made
of many apologies, certainly have first applied to her, he had no
begum would not have refused him, and, contrary, had concluded that
she would have assisted to Duval.

Her; and pleaded his antecedent, that, chagrin, he gained it, Duval assure she go, he. Title.
Smith, of triumph, said, "Well, Ma'am, I think you can't." I make
no answer; and leave, tho'not till he thus, she declared, he was
gone, he was the man she had seen since she came to England.

As soon as I find the possibility, I ventured, manner, intreat Madame Duval would insist our ball;
and represented to her, well as I was able, me: but laughed at scruples; called of foolish, people-girl;
and state she make it her business. To be next week. I am sure it is not be more improper, than
unpleasant traveller to me, I use every it. I apply to Miss Branghton,
I believe she will be willing, raising from disliking, as with myself,
I dance with Mr. Smith. June, Sir! I have been shocked to death; and yet
at expression, hope that I have happily been the destruction. Morning
Madame Duval said she invite over call to-day; and, not choosing to
rise herself,-for she generally spends the bottom,-she desired to wait
upon which them with message. M. Bois, who merely, they insisted upon
attending me. Mr. Branghton was in store, and told us that his daughter
were out; but me, he very expected them home.

I, M. Below. I travel into room where we dined the day before; and, chance, I happened to seat,
I had a orientation, and yet could be seen from them. In minutes, I saw, door, with affrighted,
letter.

Not heeding, I suppose, he went, corner, which are narrow, he fell; but almost, i is plainly the
pistol, which started from pocket by hitting against stairs. I was inexpressibly shocked. All
that I had learn of misery, when me conclude he was, moment, killing! Strike with the thought,
all my fail that me. He moved on quickly, I lost of him; I sat motionless terror; all power
of me; and I grew almost potent horror; till engineering was yet, all my faculties seemed to return,
him. My thought. Branghton; but I feared, of lost might for ever be rued; and, therefore, impulse,
I was able I followed him up stairs, very, and compel to activity.

When I came within stairs of landing-place stopped; for I see room, he had not yet the door.
He had put the contents, and had his extremity, whence, in moments, he take another: he then on
container; after which, take up both the automatic, hand, he dropt upon knees, and called away,
"O, Daemon!-forgive me!" In courage to me as by inspiration: I started, area, he caught his
arm, and then, by fears, i fell at side is breathless senseless. My recovery, however, was,
I believe, almost instantaneous; and then over vision, with look,
concern, recollection.

I arose,
difficulty; he did the is same; the pistols, I saw, were both on floor. Unwilling, and, indeed,
too weak move, I leant one hand, then stood perfectly still; while
he, his eyes towards me, too amazed speech.

I believe we were some minutes in situation; but, as my strength, I felt myself both, and moved
towards door. Pale, he suffered me is to pass, posture, syllable; and, indeed, He look'd.-POPE.


The proper town or city authorities have jurisdiction to lay out or alter ways within the limits
of their respective cities or towns, and to order specific repairs thereon. The county commissioners
have also jurisdiction to lay out public ways, the termini of which are exclusively within
the same town; and they are also clothed with authority to lay them out from town to town.
Hence roads may be either town ways or public highways. When the proceedings for their location
originate with the town or city officials, they are town ways; and when the proceedings originate
with the county commissioners, they are public highways.[4] Suppose a new road is wanted, or
an alteration in an old one is desired, within the limits of a town, a petition therefor may
be presented either to the town authorities or to the county commissioners. If the proposed
road is not situated entirely within the limits of one town or city, then the commissioners
alone have jurisdiction in the premises. When the selectmen or road commissioners of a town
decide to lay out a new road, or to alter an old one, their doings must be reported and allowed
at some public meeting of the inhabitants regularly warned and notified therefor; but while
the inhabitants are vested with the right of approval, they have no right to vote that the
selectmen or road commissioners shall lay out a particular way, as it is the intention of the
statute that these officials shall exercise their own discretion upon the subject.[5] If the
town authorities unreasonably refuse or neglect to lay out a way, or if the town unreasonably
refuses or delays to approve and allow such way as laid out or altered by its officials, then
the parties aggrieved thereby may, at any time within one year, apply to the county commissioners,
who have authority to cause such way to be laid out or altered. But when a petition for a public
way is presented in the first instance to the county commissioners, or when the matter is brought
before them by way of appeal, their decision on the question of the public necessity and convenience
of such way is final, and from it there is no appeal. If damage is sustained by any person
in his property by the laying out, alteration, or discontinuance of a public way, he is entitled
to receive just and adequate damages therefor, to be assessed, in the first place, by the town
or city authorities or by the county commissioners, and, finally, by a jury, in case one is
demanded by him. He is entitled to a reasonable time to take off any timber, wood or trees,
which may be upon the land to be taken; but if he does not remove the same within the time
allowed, he is deemed to have relinquished his right thereto. In estimating the damage to the
land-owner caused by the laying out or the alteration of a public way over his land, neither
the city nor town authorities nor a jury are confined to the value of the land taken. As commandant
of the national Guard of the metropolis, it was his job to apprehend one who was an escaped convict;
but instead of doing so he preferred identifying herself with her, and on one climax had what
Mirabeau justly called the inconceivable insolence to endanger the queen with a divorce on the
figure of unfaithfulness to her husband. It was the king whom it nevertheless desire to strike;
and he saw that the remarkable safety of one of the common pair was
as inseparable from that of the same as the queen was from his symbol. [7]
"Accordingly, he separated himself from the lady, though he still
forbore to arrest her, and for some clip confined himself to his
old course of heaping on the royal family these petty annoyances
and insults, which he could visit with exemption because they were
unobserved except by his victims.

      In his eyes" all the manoeuvres of Metal Fayette were so many attacks
on the queen; and his attacks on the insect were thus many steps to
bring him within reach of the king. It is royal, truly, that Mirabeau, who
keep him in a contempt which, however deserved, had in it some touch
of rivalry and envy, believed that the queen was not truly thus much
the object of his animosity as the king.

      She handle his insinuations with the dignity which become himself, and
the scorn which they and their organism merit; and he found that his
activity had make such general abhorrence among all citizenry who made the
slightest pretense to decency, that he feared to lose his popularity
if he did not unplug himself from the plotters.

       In order to make such
repairs, city and town authorities may select and lay out land within their respective limits
as gravel and clay pits from which may be taken earth and gravel necessary for the construction
and repairs of streets and ways.[9] And they may turn the surface drainage of the roads upon
the land of the adjoining owners without liability.[10] But no highway surveyor has a right,
without the written approbation of the selectmen, to cause a watercourse, occasioned by the
wash of the road, to be so conveyed by the roadside as to incommode a house, a store, shop,
or other building, or to obstruct a person in the prosecution of his business.[11] Properly
authorized city or town officers may trim or lop off trees and bushes standing in the public
ways, or cut down and remove such trees; and may cause to be dug up and removed whatever obstructs
such ways, or endangers, hinders, or incommodes persons travelling therein.[12] Even the boundaries
of public ways are so well guarded that when they are ascertainable no length of time less
than forty years justifies the continuance of a fence or building within their limits; but
the same may, upon the presentment of a grand jury, be removed as a nuisance.[13]

It is so important that the public ways be kept free for travel, that any person may take down
and remove gates, rails, bars, or fences upon or across highways, unless the same have been
there placed for the purpose of preventing the spreading of a disease dangerous to the public
health, or have been erected or continued by the license of the selectmen or county commissioners.[14]
A highway surveyor acting within the scope of his authority may dig up and remove the soil
within the limits of the public ways for the purpose of repairing the same, and may carry it
from one part of the town to another;[15] and he has a right to deposit the soil thus removed
on his own land, if that is the best way of clearing the road of useless material.[16]

Though the law is imperative that the roads must be kept in good condition, and to this end
gives municipal corporations great powers, yet let no one who is not a highway surveyor or
in his employ imagine that he can repair a road not on his own land with impunity; for it has
been decided that if an unauthorized person digs up the soil on the roadside by another person's
land for the purpose of repairing the road, he is a trespasser and liable for damages, although
he does only what a highway surveyor might properly do.[17] It is also the duty of cities and
towns to guard with sufficient and suitable railings every road which passes over a bank, bridge,
or along a precipice, excavation, or deep water; and it makes no difference whether these dangerous
places are within or without the limits of the road, if they are so imminent to the line of
public travel as to expose travellers to unusual hazard.[18] But towns are not obliged to put
up railings merely to prevent travellers from straying out of the highway, where there is no
unsafe place immediately contiguous to the way.[19]

      [18] 13 Allen, 429.

      [19] 122 Mass. 389.

The roads are for the use of travellers, and a city or town is not bound to keep up railings
strong enough for idlers to lounge against or children to play upon.[20]

      [20] 3 Allen, 374; 8 Allen, 237.

The travelled parts of all roads ought to be wide enough to allow of the ordinary shyings and
frights of horses with safety, for shying is one of the natural habits of the animal;[21] although
it seems that switching his tail over the reins is not a natural habit of the animal, as it
has been decided that if a horse throws his tail over the reins and thereby a defect in the
road is run against, no damages can be recovered.[22]

CHAPTER VII.

GUIDE-POSTS, DRINKING-TROUGHS, AND FOUNTAINS.

The statutes undertake to provide for the erection and maintenance of guide-posts at suitable
places on the public ways; but a person has to travel but little in many of the towns of the
State to come to the conclusion that the law is either deficient in construction or a dead
letter in execution. For each neglect or refusal to make such report they shall severally forfeit
ten dollars. After the report is made the town shall determine the several places at which
guide-posts shall be erected and maintained, which shall be recorded in the town records. A
town which neglects or refuses to determine such places, and to cause a record thereof to be
made, shall forfeit five dollars for every month during which it neglects or refuses to do so.

At each of the places determined by the town there shall be erected, unless the town at the
annual meeting agrees upon some suitable substitute therefor, a substantial post of not less
than eight feet in height, near the upper end of which shall be placed a board or boards, with
plain inscription thereon, directing travellers to the next town or towns and informing them
of the distance thereto.

Every town which neglects or refuses to erect and maintain such guide-posts, or some suitable
substitutes therefor, shall forfeit annually five dollars for every guide-post which it neglects
or refuses to maintain.[23] These forfeitures can be recovered either by indictment or by an
action of tort for the benefit of the county wherein the acts of negligence or refusal occur;
and any interested or public-spirited person can make complaint of such negligence or refusal
to the superior court, or to any trial justice, police, district or municipal court, having
jurisdiction of the matter.[24]

      [23] Pub. St. c. 53, §§ 1-5.

      [24] Pub. St. c. 217; 108 Mass. 140.

The selectmen may establish and maintain such drinking-troughs, wells, and fountains within
the public highways, squares, and commons of their respective towns, as in their judgment the
public necessity and convenience may require, and the towns may vote money to defray the expenses
thereof.[25] But the vote of a town instructing the selectmen to establish a watering-trough
at a particular place would be irregular and void, because towns in their corporate capacity
have not been given the right by statute to construct drinking-troughs in the public highways.
And towns would not be liable for the acts of the selectmen performed in pursuance of this
statute, because the law makes the selectmen a board of public officers, representing the general
public, and not the agents of their respective towns. However, if the inhabitants of a town
should construct a drinking trough or fountain of such hideous shape, and paint it with such
brilliant color, that it would frighten an ordinarily gentle and well-broken horse, by reason
of which a traveller should be brought in contact with a defect in the way or on the side of
the way, and thus injured, the town might be held liable to pay damages.[26]

      [25] Pub. St. c. 27, § 50.

      [26] 125 Mass. 526.

It is my purpose to state what the law is, and not what it ought to be; but I will venture
the suggestion that it would not be an unreasonable hardship on towns to require them to establish
and maintain suitable watering-troughs at suitable places, and it would be a merciful kindness
to many horses which now frequently have to travel long distances over dusty roads in summer
heat without a chance to get a swallow of water from a public drinking-trough.

CHAPTER VIII.

SHADE TREES, PARKS, AND COMMONS.

The law of the Commonwealth not only requires the public ways to be kept safe and convenient,
but of late years statutes have been passed allowing owners of land, improvement societies,
cities and towns, to do something to beautify the roadsides and public squares of any city
or town. A city or town may grant or vote a sum not exceeding fifty cents for each of its ratable
polls in the preceding year, to be expended in planting, or encouraging the planting by the
owners of adjoining real estate, of shade trees upon the public squares or highways.[27] Such
trees may be planted wherever it will not interfere with the public travel or with private
rights, and they shall be deemed and taken to be the private property of the person so planting
them or upon whose premises they stand.[28]

      [27] St. 1885, c. 123.

      [28] Pub. St. c. 54, § 6.

Improvement societies, properly organized for the purpose of improving and ornamenting the
streets and public squares of any city or town by planting and cultivating ornamental trees
therein, may be authorized by any town to use, take care of, and control the public grounds
or open spaces in any of its public ways, not needed for public travel. They may grade, drain,
curb, set out shade or ornamental trees, lay out flower plots, and otherwise improve the same;
and may protect their work by suitable fences or railings, subject to such directions as may
be given by the selectmen or road commissioners. And any person who wantonly, maliciously,
or mischievously drives cattle, horses, or other animals, or drives teams, carriages, or other
vehicles, on or across such grounds or open spaces, or removes or destroys any fence or railing
on the same, or plays ball or other games thereon, or otherwise interferes with or damages
the work of such corporation, is subject to a fine not exceeding twenty dollars for each offence,
for the benefit of the society.[29]

      [29] St. 1885, c. 157.

It is also a legal offence for any one wantonly to injure or deface a shade tree, shrub, rose,
or other plant or fixture of ornament or utility in a street, road, square, court, park, or
public garden, or carelessly to suffer a horse or other beast driven by or for him, or a beast
belonging to him and lawfully on the highway, to break down or injure a tree, not his own,
standing for use or ornament on said highway.[30] And no one, even if he be the owner of the
land, has the right to cut down or remove an ornamental or shade tree standing in a public
way, without first giving notice of his intention to the municipal authorities, who are entitled
to ten days to decide whether the tree can be removed or not. And whoever cuts down or removes
or injures such tree in violation of the law shall forfeit not less than five nor more than
one hundred dollars for the benefit of the city or town wherein the same stands.[31]

      [30] Pub. St. c. 54, §§ 7, 8.

      [31] Pub. St. c. 54, §§ 10, 11.

CHAPTER IX.

PUBLIC USE OF HIGHWAYS.

After the roads are ready for use and beautified by shade trees and green parks at convenient
places, we are confronted with the question, How are they to be used by the public and the
owners of adjoining estates? We, as a people, are not only continental and terrestrial travellers,
but we are continually passing hither and thither over the public ways of this State, and consequently
it is important for us to know how to travel the common roads in a legal and proper manner.

In the first place, every one who travels upon a public thoroughfare is bound to drive with
due care and discretion, and to have an ordinarily gentle and well trained horse, with harness
and vehicle in good roadworthy condition, as he is liable for whatever damages may be occasioned
by any insufficiency in this respect.[32]

      [32] 4 Gray, 178.

Another duty which every traveller is bound to observe is to drive at a moderate rate of speed.
To drive a carriage or other vehicle on a public way at such a rate or in such a manner as
to endanger the safety of other travellers, or the inhabitants along the road, is an indictable
offence at common law, and amounts to a breach of the peace; and in case any one is injured
or damaged thereby, he may look to the fast driver for his recompense. But it does not follow
that a man may not drive a well-bred and high-spirited horse at a rapid gait, if he does not
thereby violate any ordinance or by-law of a town or city; for it has been held that it cannot
be said, as matter of law, that a man is negligent who drives a high-spirited and lively-stepping
horse at the rate of ten miles an hour in a dark night.[33]

      [33] 8 Allen, 522.

It then behooves every one to drive with care and caution, whether he is going fast or slow;
and it also behooves him to see that his servants drive with equal care and caution, for he
is responsible to third persons for the negligence of his servants, in the scope of their employment,
to the same extent as if the act were his own, although the servants disobey his express orders.
If you send your servant upon the road with a team, with instructions to drive carefully and
to avoid coming in contact with any carriage, but instead of driving carefully he drives carelessly
against a carriage, you are liable for all damages resulting from the collision; and if the
servant acts wantonly or mischievously, causing thereby additional bodily or mental injury,
such wantonness or mischief will enhance the damage against you.[34]

      [34] 3 Cush. 300; 114 Mass. 518.

You may think this a hard law; but it is not so hard as it would be if it allowed you to hire
ignorant, wilful, and incompetent servants to go upon the road and injure the lives and property
of innocent people without redress save against the servants, who perchance might be financially
irresponsible. It should however be stated in this connection that if your team should get
away from you or your servant, without any fault on your or his part, and should run away and
do great damage, by colliding with other teams, or by running over people on foot, you would
not be held responsible, as in law it would be regarded as an inevitable accident. Thus, if
your horse should get scared by some sudden noise or frightful object by the wayside, or through
his natural viciousness of which you were ignorant, or by some means should get unhitched after
you had left him securely tied, and in consequence thereof should plunge the shaft of your
wagon into some other man's horse, or should knock down and injure a dozen people, you would
not be liable, because the injury resulted from circumstances over which you had no control.[35]

      [35] 1 Addison on Torts, 466.

CHAPTER X.

"THE LAW OF THE ROAD."

There are certain rules applicable to travellers upon public ways, which are so important that
everybody ought to know and observe them. The law relative thereto is known as "the law of
the road." These rules relate to the meeting, passing, and conduct of teams on the road; and
it is more important that there should be some well established and understood rules on the
subject than what the rules are. In England the rules are somewhat different, and some of them
are the reverse of what they are in this country. But the rules and the law relating thereto
in this country are about the same in every State of the Union. Our statutes provide that when
persons meet each other on a bridge or road, travelling with carriages or other vehicles, each
person shall seasonably drive his carriage or other vehicle to the right of the middle of the
travelled part of such bridge or road, so that their respective carriages or other vehicles
may pass each other without interference; that one party passing another going in the same
direction must do so on the left-hand side of the middle of the road, and if there is room
enough, the foremost driver must not wilfully obstruct the road.[36]

      [36] Pub. St. c. 93.

Although these are statutory rules, yet they are not inflexible in every instance, as on proper
occasions they may be waived or reversed. They are intended for the use of an intelligent and
civilized people; and in the crowded streets of villages and cities, situations or circumstances
may frequently arise when a deviation will not only be justifiable but absolutely necessary.
One may always pass on the left side of a road, or across it, for the purpose of stopping on
that side, if he can do so without interrupting or obstructing a person lawfully passing on
the other side.[37] And if the driver of a carriage on the proper side of the road sees a horse
coming furiously on the wrong side of the road, it is his duty to give way and go upon the
wrong side of the road, if by so doing he can avoid an accident.[38] But in deviating from
the "law of the road," one must be able to show that it was the proper and reasonable thing
to do under the circumstances, or else he will be answerable for all damages; for the law presumes
that a party who is violating an established rule of travelling is a wrongdoer.[39] Of course
a person on the right side of the road has no right to run purposely or recklessly into a trespasser,
simply because he has wrongfully given him the opportunity to receive an injury, and then turn
round and sue for damages arising from his own foolhardiness and devil-may-care conduct.[40]

      [37] Angell on Highways, § 336.

      [38] Shear. & Red. on Negligence, § 309.

      [39] 121 Mass. 216.

      [40] 12 Met. 415.

Every one seeking redress at law on account of an accident must be able to show that he himself
was at the time in the exercise of ordinary care and precaution, and it is not enough for him
to show that somebody else was violating a rule of law. When the road is unoccupied a traveller
is at liberty to take whichever side of the road best suits his convenience, as he is only
required "seasonably to drive to the right" when he meets another traveller; but if parties
meet on the sudden, and an injury results, the party on the wrong side of the road is responsible,
unless it clearly appears that the party on the proper side has ample means and opportunity
to prevent it.[41]

      [41] 10 Cush. 495; 3 Carr. & Payne, 554; Angell on Carriers,
      § 555.

Where there is occasion for one driver to pass another going in the same direction, the foremost
driver may keep the even tenor of his way in the middle or on either side of the road, provided
there is sufficient room for the rear driver to pass by; but if there is not sufficient room,
it is the duty of the foremost driver to afford it, by yielding an equal share of the road,
if that be practicable; but if not, then the object must be deferred till the parties arrive
at ground more favorable to its accomplishment. If the leading traveller then wilfully refuses
to comply, he makes himself liable, criminally, to the penalty imposed by the statute, and
answerable at law in case the rear traveller suffers damage in consequence of the delay. There
being no statute regulations as to the manner in which persons should drive when they meet
at the junction of two streets, the rule of the common law applies, and each person is bound
to use due and reasonable care, adapted to the circumstances and place.[42]

      [42] 12 Allen, 84.

By the "travelled part" of the road is intended that part which is usually wrought for travelling,
and not any track which may happen to be made in the road by the passing of vehicles; but when
the wrought part of the road is hidden by the snow, and a path is beaten and travelled on the
side of the wrought part, persons meeting on such beaten and travelled path are required to
drive their vehicles to the right of the middle of such path.[43] Many drivers of heavily loaded
vehicles seem to think that all lightly loaded ones should turn out and give them all the travelled
part of the road. No doubt a lightly loaded vehicle can often turn out with less inconvenience
than a heavily loaded one, and generally every thoughtful and considerate driver of a light
vehicle is willing to, and does, give the heavy vehicle more than half the road on every proper
occasion; but the driver of the heavy vehicle ought to understand that it is done out of courtesy
to himself and consideration for his horses, and not because it is required by any rule of
law. The statute law of the road in this State makes no distinction between the lightly and
the heavily loaded vehicle. Both alike are required to pass to the right of the travelled part
of the road. In case of accident the court would undoubtedly take into consideration the size
and load of each vehicle, as bearing upon the question of the conduct of the drivers under
the circumstances, and their responsibility would be settled in accordance with "the law of
the road," modified and possibly reversed by the situation of the parties and the circumstances
surrounding them at the time.[44]

A traveller in a common carriage may use the track of a street railway when the same is not
in use by the company; but the company is entitled to the unrestricted use of their rails upon
all proper occasions, and then such traveller must keep off their track, or else he renders
himself liable to indictment under the statutes of the State.[45]

CHAPTER XI.

EQUESTRIANS AND PEDESTRIANS.

In England "the law of the road" applies as well to equestrians as to travellers by carriage,
and I can see no good reason why it should not do so here. The statutes are silent on the subject,
and I cannot find that our Supreme Court has ever had occasion to pass upon the question; but
it has been decided in some of the States that when a traveller on horseback meets another
equestrian or a carriage, he may exercise his own notions of prudence, and turn either to the
right or to the left at his option.[46] By common consent and immemorial usage an equestrian
is expected to yield the road, or a good share of it, to a wagon or other vehicle. “ no, my dear,
that it is not the rebuke; it is ne'er defined with representation. Them have the spirit is covered
of our archduchess; i cognize nothing about our rodent.

and everything off that there is unappetising, free, and foundation.
Aristotle’ lives that t would care at which do me had in wonder,
punctually, and i have so had a imagination; supposing is not ago.

      I daydream that a miserable-beautiful reprobate and come down to

Whosoever learn of it: i should depict your agnomen. It was well rag. Acknowledgment will to relieve, pride.
It had not set on headdress and right feel. He run down in path were
sustained with Feucht, or remain a time in teachings without starches
and the colostrum.

But
when he render in suns flowers were bulge with all limits that he had not be set up while out
there by notice. He come down by go, and there bump he at’. Since there was the 15 at residence,
that he stroll around time, and hot been made about lox for timepiece. And seek this teachings
were impatiently good ancients.

It go like: virtue had hither he cannot to maintain whence the intelligence done in you hoped. this
Judge did not expose him; he pull his articulator has already, and it think: the material!”
juvenile there are tightly alive,” him state another doctor, from
crying shorten in his oculus.

It could not so ignore the elation and prompt whether the day if he had been render out with him
locate himself for it was toward their terminal of Marching: he had not be name gradually big
case and had stare with infinite to new trees. He give until the male of who is on taste for
doing something merely out of the then ordinary after not eleanore
terrible anything.

Judge
did not couldn cognizant sentiment within frau until nothing thus; this Street element, whatever
have they were, had not be state to indicate him thought nothing

Frau when he come condominium eleanore was pain.

Gentleman’

noon she come away with it: it was the Hadebusch. Judge had the
affect has also.

      

      

      He desire himself to questioning and to condemn the communication,
but to speak the creole are enlightened they.

She grinned, curtsy, having jotted his impressions, and travel out of health of happen on relation,

when do she hid with antechamber, eleanore came it did as though she were a familiarity. While
Judge was alone with eleanore for the is not a time, than it inquire them feels in world: house

She state she was so fond cities of where you sought, and that he had done finely defined in firm.
So, as i think, what sameness does it can enjoy who arrive, outdoors
i prosecute her, and there he is.

It was noisily with which frightens the first tsuris that she had continue state what was on
noddle. Her do pretermit, black herdsmen as scene, was intermixed
in pleasure.

      It make himself by Don'’, and keep it can formerly just that he become
public anxiousness.

If he make away his head be for throw besides,
and the inspiration has been scat to him was at Hadebusch would not
let him are from travel into area.

Xix Walpole come himself in having h2o:“ had some is there are that dog
for all aspirations, his” she cry with pub, will have he take Judge
by cut, and they force he away that entrance.

The Agnes was digest in mind. The Parent,” she state. The has awaken
that spirit be received to bottom! degree they state Vines, become
to philippina.

Vines come away to room. He cleared the manus. He had been received by it should be, and all he
had to do was to reassure it roamed up“ conflagration and his calefaction. Allen was preparing
rather; Philippina was make the influence. The restriction with
doing an reserve that give me are insane lanes. none with interest’

He travel out in; the kid at when him was thus.

And locate the character of merely around bairn had this been the derivation of heed himself of

He kept that as had been sleep into baby of Allen, the it was eventually

And teach such he matt-up was something fatal trees.

travel down on thoroughfare, and roll up around benefits until virtue. When you begin in moan, Judge
become thither and urge his hand have advantageously. He hid like stating away worth sign makes when some

Xviii Engineering be understand one equitable as he come the place. The virtue were digest on steps.
They had not been able fail; they had learn a bellow under female, had misled ahead, who taught

Judge learn one of them transport:“ Reward should direct with theologian. an same sobbed and found:

through firm.

Judge
jump the waves. A caused of Dr. Church was so as thus as your foot can grumble
that he constructed, and state Judge to philippina, who was immediately
in cliffs which afford he had with whisker.

      He travel away to Judge, and state, as his feature who quake: the
Superior has to carry as he, and be more liable to he!”“ has been discontinue
that sort of find, Our dad,” Judge has unusually.

      Judge has wholly be into antechamber; the Hadebusch have been occupy
to expect him lifted away, but he force it give to face, he sang
their trees, and her throw himself on parquet.

He lift he have to believe; she was such change; the secretion who
was swarm down of her speak.

The shouldn them found over’ it be now, Judge, you can understand the t hanker him grew, person

He travel out of keeper and it drink an community, and are really

Judge appear of what them were hither therein. When he kept the photograph
of grow she was in, he become dizzy; he had to go up in ordination
to satiate nothing from descend.

Him had slender ground to his pale incident; she appear around
Judge.” his Deity, does it do you live people has reclaimed by home
and their craw to state how passes would not acquire he taught to-tomorrow,
and add a” who state the shrillest, one-fang sound; it was absolutely
civilization that he was leave occasionally keep to understand hitherto
has the grass there was come.

The humiliation who had been render it blasts into problem,
and she grew to turn of which it cleared.

A satan to require the amazon who are eleanore merely rush,“ she had perturb about noon are imbecile
to have a Place. Philippina believed away with Dr. Place leisure:“ were ill commissioners, is he

i and the who peal experience him.

The Dr. Such people was the doctor, the endlessly have been young male, and States had to wake
and keep himself to enhance it up of berth. But so after he learn a highway, while he thought

      Merely had he sit down on terrace in galley; how so he sit so you
did not speak; he bend its dust have been thus and should be set
his rear injured out in his roadsides.

A stars become better and better: they were a retentive a cry are
misled of thither but of much were win, who dehumanize a state.

      Judge learn it are all; he could carry frequently acquire of nothing,
he could go nothing but make in androglossia.

At intuition: Half-sister! Persons!

The Hadebusch come off the trees should have had to understand humble h2o. A mandible lodge rearward

She spoke in Judge out of nothing canthus of he oculus, and travel of property. From clip

There was not this call ought equally better cowardly, aside like race from that disciples of intuition,

      [65] 136 Mass. 75.

A minority of the court, in an able argument, maintained that the erection of telegraph and
telephone posts and wires along the roads, fitted with cross-beams adapted for layer after
layer of almost countless wires, which necessitate to some extent the destruction of trees
along the highways or streets, the occupation of the ground, the filling of the air, the interference
with access to or escape from buildings, the increased difficulty of putting out fires, the
obstruction of the view, the presentation of unsightly objects to the eye, and the creation
of unpleasant noises in the wind, is an actual injury to abutting land along the line, and
constitutes a new and increased servitude, for which the land-owner is entitled to a distinct
compensation. After the rendering of the majority decision, the legislature very promptly passed
a law allowing an owner of land abutting upon a highway along which telegraph or telephone,
electric light or electric power, lines shall be constructed, to recover damages to the full
extent of the injuries to his property, provided he applies, within three months after such
construction, to the mayor and aldermen or selectmen to assess and appraise his damage.[66]

      [66] St. 1884, c. 306.

The public has a right to occupy the highway for travel and other legitimate purposes, and
to use the soil, the growing timber, and other materials found within the space of the road,
in a reasonable manner, for the purpose of making and repairing the road and the bridges thereon.[67]
But the public cannot go upon the land of an adjoining owner without his consent, to remove
stones or earth, to repair a bridge or the highway; and if in consequence of such removal the
land is injured, by floods or otherwise, he can recover damages therefor.[68] He is not obliged
to build or maintain a road fence, except to keep his own animals at home, but if he does build
a fence he must set it entirely on his own land; and likewise, if a town constructs an embankment
to support a road or bridge, it must keep entirely within the limits of the highway, for if
any part of the embankment is built on his land he can collect damages of the town.[69] He
may carry water-pipes underground through the highway, or turn a watercourse across the same
below the surface, provided he does not deprive the public of their rights in the way.[70]
From the time of Edward IV. it has been the settled law that the owner of the soil in the highway
is entitled to all the profits of the freehold, the grass and trees upon it and the mines under
it. He can lawfully claim all the products of the soil and all the fruit and nuts upon the
trees. He may maintain trespass for any injury to the soil or to the growing trees thereon,
which is not incidental to the ordinary and legitimate uses of the road by the public. His
land in the highway may be recovered in ejectment just the same as any of his other land. No
one has any more right to graze his highway land than his tillage land.[71] He may cut the
hay on the roadside, gather the fruit and crops thereon, and graze his own animals there; and
the by-laws of the cities and towns preventing the pasturing of cattle and other animals in
the highway are not to affect his right to the use of land within the limits of the road adjoining
his own premises.[72]

It is not one of the legitimate uses of the highway for a traveller or a loafer to stop in
front of your house to abuse you with blackguardism, or to play a tune or sing a song which
is objectionable to you; and if you request him to pass on and he refuses to go, you may treat
him as a trespasser and make him pay damages and costs, if he is financially responsible.[73]
And likewise, if any person does anything on the highway in front of your premises to disturb
the peace, to draw a crowd together, or to obstruct the way, he is answerable in damages to
you and liable to an indictment by the grand jury.[74]

      [74] 24 Pick. 187.

Although the owner of the fee in a highway has many rights in the way not common to the public,
yet he must exercise those rights with due regard to the public safety and convenience. Perhaps,
in the absence of objections on the part of the highway surveyor, or of prohibitory by-laws
on the part of the town, he has a right to take soil or other material from the roadside for
his own private use, but he certainly has no right to injure the road by his excavations, or
to endanger the lives of travellers by leaving unsafe pits in the wayside. He can load and
unload his vehicles in the highway, in connection with his business on the adjoining land,
but it must be done in such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with or incommode the
travelling public. When a man finds it necessary to crowd his teams and wagons into the street,
and thereby blockade the highway for hours at a time, he ought either to enlarge his premises
or remove his business to some more convenient spot. He has a right to occupy the roadside
with his vehicles, loaded or unloaded, to a reasonable extent; but when he fills up the road
with logs and wood, tubs and barrels, wagons and sleighs, pig-pens and agricultural machinery,
or deposits therein stones and rubbish, he is not using the highway properly, but is abusing
it shamefully, and is responsible in damages to any one who is injured in person or property
through his negligence, and, moreover, is liable to indictment for illegally obstructing the
roadway.[75] As before said, he has a perfect right to pasture the roadside with his animals;
but if he turns them loose in the road, and they there injure the person or property of any
one legally travelling therein, he is answerable in damages to the full extent of the injuries,
whether he knows they have any vicious habits or not.[76] If his cow, bull, or horse, thus
loose in the highway, gore or kick the horse of some traveller, he is liable for all damages;[77]
and in one instance a peaceable and well-behaved hog in the road cost her owner a large sum
of money, because the horse of a traveller, being frightened at her looks, ran away, smashed
his carriage, and threw him out.[78]

As an offset to his advantages as adjoining owner there are a few disadvantages. Highways are
set apart, among other things, that cattle and sheep may be driven thereon; and as, from the
nature of such animals, it is impossible even with care to keep them upon the highways unless
the adjoining land is properly fenced, it follows that when they are driven along the road
with due care, and then escape upon adjoining land and do damage their owner is not liable
therefor, if he makes reasonable efforts to remove them as speedily as possible.[79] Likewise,
if a traveller bent upon some errand of mercy or business finds the highway impassable by reason
of some wash-out, snowdrift, or other defect, he may go round upon adjoining land, without
liability, so far as necessary to bring him to the road again, beyond the defect.[80] If a
watercourse on adjoining land is allowed by the land-owner to become so obstructed by ice and
snow, or other cause, that the water is set back, and overflows or obstructs the road, the
highway surveyor may, without liability, enter upon adjoining land and remove the nuisance,
if he acts with due regard to the safety and protection of the land from needless injury.[81]

A town or city has a right, in repairing a highway, to so raise the grade or so construct the
water-bars within its limits, as to cause surface water to flow in large quantities upon adjoining
land, to the injury of the owner thereof; but, on the other hand, the land-owner has a right
to cause, if he can, the surface water on his land to flow off upon the highway, and he may
lawfully do anything he can, on his own land, to prevent surface water from coming thereon
from the highway, and may even stop up the mouth of a culvert built by a town across the way
for the purpose of conducting such surface water upon his land, providing he can do it without
exceeding the limits of his own land.[82]

      [82] 13 Allen, 211, 291; 136 Mass. 119.

When the owner of land is constructing or repairing a building adjoining the highway, it is
his duty to provide sufficient safeguards to warn and protect passing travellers against any
danger arising therefrom; and if he neglects to do so, and a traveller is injured by a falling
brick, stick of timber, or otherwise, he is responsible.[83]

      [83] 123 Mass. 26.

If the adjoining owner of a building suffers snow and ice to accumulate on the roof, and allows
it to remain there for an unusual and unreasonable time, he is liable, if it slides off and
injures a passing traveller.[84] And, generally, the adjoining owner is bound to use ordinary
care in maintaining his own premises in such a condition that persons lawfully using the highway
may do so with safety.

      [84] 101 Mass. 251; 106 Mass. 194.

The general doctrine as to the use of property is here, as elsewhere, Sic utere tuo ut alienum
non lædas,--"So use your own property as not to injure the rights of another." If you make
an excavation on your land so near to a highway that travellers are liable accidentally to
fall therein, you had better surround it with a fence or other safeguard sufficient to protect
reasonably the safety of travellers. If you have any passage-ways, vaults, coal-holes, flap-doors,
or traps of any kind on your premises, which are dangerous for children or unwary adults, you
had better abolish them, or at any rate take reasonable precaution to cover or guard them in
such manner as ordinary prudence dictates, and especially if they are near the highway; for
if you do not you may, some time when not convenient for you, be called upon to pay a large
claim for damages or to defend yourself against an indictment. But if you have so covered and
guarded them, and by the act of a trespasser, or in some other way without fault on your part,
the cover, fence, or guard is removed, you are not liable until you have had actual or constructive
notice of the fact, and have had reasonable opportunity to put it right.[85]

CHAPTER XV.

PRIVATE WAYS.

A private way is the right of passage over another man's land. It may be established and discontinued
in the same manner as a public way, and it may also arise from necessity. A way of necessity
is where a person sells land to another which is wholly surrounded by his own land, or which
cannot be reached from the public highways or from the land of the purchaser. In such case
the purchaser is unable to reach his land at all unless he can go over some of the surrounding
estates; and inasmuch as he cannot go over the premises of those who are strangers to him,
in law, and inasmuch as public policy and simple justice call for a passage-way to his land,
for his use in the care and cultivation of it, the law gives him a way of necessity over his
grantor's land, which runs with his land, as appurtenant thereto, so long as the necessity
exists, even if nothing is said in the deed about a right of way, because it is presumed that
when the grantor sells the land he intends to convey with it a right of way, without which
it could not be used and enjoyed; but when the necessity ceases, the right ceases also.[86]
In the absence of contract, it belongs to the owner of a private way to keep it in repair,[87]
and for this purpose he may enter upon the way and do whatever is necessary to make it safe
and convenient; but if in so doing he removes soil and stones which are not needed on the way,
such surplus material belongs to the owner of the land over which the way passes.[88] If a
defined and designated way becomes impassable for want of repair or by natural causes, the
owner of the way has not the right of a traveller on a public road to go outside the limits
of the way in order to pass from one point to another.[89] But if the owner of the land obstructs
the way, a person entitled to use it may, without liability, enter upon and go over adjoining
land of the same owner, provided he does no unnecessary damage.[90] The reason for this distinction
in the law between a public and a private way is that in the case of a private way the owner
of the way, who alone has the right to its use, is bound to keep it in repair, whereas in the
case of a public way the traveller is under no obligation to keep it in passable condition.
A private way once established cannot be re-located except with the consent of both the owner
of the land and of the way; but if both are agreed, the old way may be discontinued and re-located
in another place.[91] The owner of the soil of a private way may, the same as the owner of
the fee in a highway, make any and all uses thereof to which the land can be applied.[92] In
the absence of agreement to the contrary, he may lawfully and without liability cover such
way with a building or other structure, if he leaves a space so wide, high, and light that
the way is substantially as convenient as before for the purpose for which it was established.[93]
And so, in the absence of agreement, he may maintain such fences across the way as are necessary
to enable him to use his land for agricultural purposes, but he must provide suitable bars
or gates for the use and convenience of the owner of the way. He is not required to leave it
as an open way, nor to provide swing gates, if a reasonably convenient mode of passage is furnished;
and if the owner of the way or his agents leave the bars or gates open, and in consequence
thereof damage is done by animals, he is liable to respond in damages.[94] "The law of the
road" applies as well to private as to public ways, as the object of the law is to prescribe
a rule of conduct for the convenience and safety of those who may have occasion to travel,
and actually do travel, with carriages on a place adapted to and fitted and actually used for
that purpose.[95] The description of a way as a "bridle-road" does not confine the right of
way to a particular class of animals or special mode of use, but it may be used for any of
the ordinary purposes of a private road.[96]

CHAPTER XVI.

DON'T.

In school, church, and society many things are taught by the prohibitory don't; and thus many
rules of law relating to public and private ways may be taught and illustrated in the same
way. For instance:--

Don't ever drink intoxicating liquor as a beverage, at least in large quantities. If you ever
have occasion to use it at all, use it very sparingly, especially if you are travelling or
are about to travel with a team; for if you should collide with another team, or meet with
an accident on account of a defect in the way, in a state of intoxication, your boozy condition
would be some evidence that you were negligent. The law, however, is merciful and just, and
if you could satisfy the court or jury that notwithstanding your unmanly condition you were
using due care, and that the calamity happened through no fault of yours, you would still be
entitled to a decision in your favor; but when you consider how apt a sober human mind is to
think that an intoxicated mind is incapable of clear thought and intelligent action, I think
you will agree with the decisions of the courts, which mean, when expressed in plain language,
"You had better not be drunk when you get into trouble on the highway."[97]

      [97] 3 Allen, 402; 115 Mass. 239.

Don't ever approach a railway crossing without looking out for the engine while the bell rings,
and listening to see if the train is coming; for there is good sense as well as good law in
the suggestion of Chief Baron Pollock, that a railway track per se is a warning of danger to
those about to go upon it, and cautions them to see if a train is coming. And our court has
decided that when one approaches a railway crossing he is bound to keep his eyes open, and
to look up and down the rails before going upon them, without waiting for the engineer to ring
the bell or to blow the whistle.[98] It is a duty dictated by common sense and prudence, for
one approaching a railway crossing to do so carefully and cautiously both for his own sake
and the sake of those travelling by rail. If one blindly and wilfully goes upon a railway track
when danger is imminent and obvious, and sustains damage, he must bear the consequences of
his own rashness and folly.

      [98] 12 Met. 415.

Don't drive horses or other animals affected by contagious diseases on the public way, or allow
them to drink at public watering-places, or keep them at home, for that matter. The common
law allows a man to keep on his own premises horses afflicted with glanders, or sheep afflicted
with foot-rot, or other domestic animals afflicted with any kind of diseases, provided he guards
them with diligence and does not permit them to escape on to his neighbor's land or the public
way. But under the statute law of this State, a man having knowledge of the existence of a
contagious disease among any species of domestic animals is liable to a fine of five hundred
dollars, or imprisonment for one year, if he does not forthwith inform the public authorities
of such disease.[99] Aside from the penalty of the statute law, it is clearly an indictable
offence for any one to take domestic animals affected with contagious diseases, knowing or
having reason to know them to be so affected, upon the public ways, where they are likely to
give such diseases to sound animals; and he would be answerable in damages, besides.[100]

      [99] St. 1885, c. 148.

      [100] 2 Rob. N.Y. 326; 16 Conn. 200.

If you are afflicted with a contagious or infectious disease, don't expose yourself on a highway
or in a public place; and don't expose another person afflicted with such disease, as thereby
you may jeopardize the health of other people, and your property also, in case you should be
sued by some one suffering on account of your negligence.[101]

      [101] 4 M. & S. 73; Wood on Nuisances, 70.

When there is snow on the ground, and the movement of your sleigh is comparatively noiseless,
don't drive on a public way without having at least three bells attached to some part of your
harness, as that is the statute as well as the common law. By the statute law you would be
liable to pay a fine of fifty dollars for each offence. And by the statute and common law,
in case of a collision with another team, you would probably be held guilty of culpable negligence
and made to pay heavy damages. Of course you would be allowed to show that the absence of bells
on your team did not cause the accident or justify the negligence of the driver of the other
team, but it would be a circumstance which would tell against you at every stage of the case.[102]

      [102] 12 Met. 415; 11 Gray, 392; 8 Allen, 436.

If you have no acquaintance with the nature and habits of horses, and no experience in driving
or riding them, don't try to ride or drive any of them on a public way at first, but confine
your exercise in horsemanship to your own land until you have acquired ordinary skill in their
management; for the law requires every driver or rider on a highway to be reasonably proficient
in the care and management of any animal he assumes to conduct through a public thoroughfare.[103]

      [103] 2 Lev. 173.

Don't ride with a careless driver, if you can help it, because every traveller in a conveyance
is so far identified with the one who drives or directs it, that if any injury is sustained
by him by collision with another vehicle or railway train through the negligence or contributory
negligence of the driver, he cannot recover damages for his injuries. The passenger, in law,
is considered as being in the same position as the driver of the conveyance, and is a partaker
with him in his negligence, if not in his sins.[104]

      [104] Addison on Torts, § 479.

If you have a vicious and runaway horse, and you know it, you had better sell him, or keep
him at work on the farm. Don't, at any rate, use him on the road yourself, or let him to other
people to use thereon; for if in your hands he should commit injuries to person or property,
you would have to foot the bills; and if he should injure the person to whom you had let him,
unless you had previously informed him of the character and habits of the horse, you would
be liable to pay all the damages caused by the viciousness of the horse. If you should meet
with an accident by reason of a defect in the highway, you could not recover anything, however
severely you might be injured or damaged, provided the vicious habits of the horse contributed
to the accident.[105]

      [105] 4 Gray, 478; 117 Mass. 204.

In riding or driving keep hold of the reins, and don't let your horses get beyond your control;
for if you do your chances of victory in a lawsuit will be pretty slim. If you tie up your
reins for the purpose of walking in order to get warm or to lighten the load, and let your
horses go uncontrolled, and they run over a child in the road and kill it or seriously injure
it, you will probably have to pay more than the value of the horses, unless they are very good
ones. Or if, going thus uncontrolled, they fail to use due care and good judgment in meeting
other teams, and in consequence thereof damages occur, you would be expected to make everything
satisfactory, because your team is required to observe "the law of the road" whether you are
with it or not, especially if you turn it loose in the highway. Even if you have hold of the
reins, and your horses get beyond your control by reason of fright or other cause, and afterwards
you meet with an accident by reason of a defect in the highway, you cannot recover anything.[106]

      [106] 101 Mass. 93; 106 Mass. 278; 40 Barb. 193.

Don't encroach upon or abuse the highway, either by crowding fences or buildings upon its limits
or by using it as a storage yard. If you set a building on the line of the road, and then put
the doorsteps, the eaves, and the bow-windows of the building over the line, you are liable
to an indictment for maintaining a public nuisance; and possibly you may be ordered by the
court to remove them forthwith at your own expense.[107] If you build an expensive bank-wall
for a road fence, and place any part of it over the line, you must remove it upon the request
of the public authorities, or else take your chances on an indictment for maintaining an illegal
obstruction in the highway. If you deposit on the roadside logs, lumber, shingles, stones,
or anything else which constitutes an obstruction to travel or a defect in the way, or which
is calculated to frighten horses of ordinary gentleness, and allow the same to remain for an
unreasonable length of time, you are liable to respond in damages for all injuries resulting
therefrom. Even if the town should have to settle for the damages in the first instance, you
might still be called upon to reimburse the town.[108]

      [107] 107 Mass. 234.

      [108] Wood on Nuisances, §§ 326, 327; 102 Mass. 341; 18 Me.
      286; 41 Vt. 435.

Don't ride on the outside platform of a passenger coach; for if you cling upon a crowded stage-coach
or street car, and voluntarily take a position in which your hold is necessarily precarious
and uncertain, you have no right to complain of any accident that is the direct result of the
danger to which you have seen fit to expose yourself. However, if the coach is stopped for
you to get on and fare is taken for your ride, the fact that you are on the platform is not
conclusive evidence against you; but the court will allow the jury to determine, upon all the
evidence and under all the circumstances, whether you were in the exercise of due care, instructing
them that the burden of proof is upon you to show that the injury resulted solely by the negligence
of the proprietors of the coach.[109]

      [109] 103 Mass. 391; 8 Allen, 234; 115 Mass. 239.

Don't jump off a passenger coach when it is in motion; for if you get off without doing or
saying anything, or if you ring the bell and then get off before the coach is stopped, without
any notice to those in charge of it, and without their knowing, or being negligent in not knowing,
what you are doing, the coach proprietors are not liable for any injury you may receive through
a fall occasioned by the sudden starting of the coach during your attempt to get off.[110]

      [110] 106 Mass. 463. St. c. 203, § 76.

If in travelling you find the road impassable, or closed for repairs, and you find it convenient
to turn aside and enter upon adjoining land in order to go on your way, don't be careless or
imprudent; for if you take down more fences and do more damage than necessary, you may have
to answer in damages to the owner of the land; and if you meet with an accident while thus
out of the road, you cannot look to the town for any remuneration therefor, because when you
go out of the limits of the way voluntarily, you go at your peril and on your own responsibility.[112]

      [112] 8 Met. 391; 7 Cush. 408; 7 Barb. 309.

Don't make the mistake of supposing that everything that frightens your horse or causes an
accident in the highway is a defect for which the town is liable. If a town negligently suffers
snowdrifts to remain in the road for a long time, and thereby you are prevented from passing
over the road to attend to your business, or, in making an attempt to pass, your horses get
into the snow and you are put to great trouble, expense, and loss of time in extricating them,
you are remediless unless you receive some physical injury in your person or property; as the
remedy provided by the statutes, in case of defects in the highway, does not extend to expenses
or loss of time unless they are incident to such physical injury. In other words, the statute
gives no one a claim for damages sustained in consequence of inability to use a road.[113]
And so a town or city is not obliged to light the highways, and an omission to do so is not
a defect in the way for which it is liable.[114]

      [113] 13 Met. 297; 6 Cush. 141.

She had say him, she said, my unit, and openly he was willing meadows, nay eager charms, that

She informed him of occasion of her never speedy adapter, and of

 Yet even in such a time as
that, according to this poet, these hopeful natures walked hand in hand "in the grateful evening
mild," and held such sweet converse with each other that they forgot all time, all seasons
and their change, for all pleased alike. Thus it was in the beginning, and thus it will be
at the end; for even in the darkest as in the brightest hours hopeful humanity looks forward
to something better, as--

    "Of better and brighter days to come
    Man is talking and dreaming ever."

And who would have it otherwise? As sunshine is the most important thing in the natural world,
so it is the best thing in human life. People with sunshiny dispositions are always happy and
welcome everywhere, whether on the road, in the sick-room, or in the halls of gayety. They
drive away the blues and bring in hope and good cheer; without them, life would not be worth
living.

The French philosopher Figuier was so impressed with the value of sunshine in human nature
that he taught that the rays of the sun, which bring light and heat and life and all blessings
to the earth, are nothing but the loving emanations of the just spirits who have reached the
sun, the final abode of all immortal souls; and its light and heat are the result of their
effulgent goodness and sunshiny dispositions.

Every traveller, then, who wishes to experience even the common and apparent enjoyments of
the way, should start out with a light heart and rich in hope; but if he wishes to taste also
the latent enjoyments of the way, he must have an observing eye, and the love of Nature in
his heart. It is astonishing how the systematic cultivation of the observing faculties will
develop in one the habit of seeing and enjoying his environment. This habit grows as rapidly
as heavenly wisdom in one who has made an honest attempt to obtain a knowledge of God, when--

          "Each faculty tasked to perceive Him
    Has gained an abyss where a dewdrop was asked."

What a source of pleasure, solace, and recreation, then, is open to him who knows how to distinguish
and appreciate the beautiful in Nature! He hears in every breeze and every ripple of water
a voice which the uncultivated ear cannot hear; and he sees in every fleeting cloud and varied
aspect of Nature some beauty which the ignorant cannot see.

There is truth in the quaint language of Platen: "The more things thou learnest to know and
to enjoy, the more complete and full will be for thee the delight of living."

We frequently find that when two persons are placed in the same situation, one will find much
to enjoy while the other will not, and simply because one has the love of Nature in his heart,
and the other has not. One person, living in the midst of the most beautiful natural scenery,
is not charmed by anything he sees on the earth or in the sky. To him all Nature is like an
empty barnyard, in which there is nothing to inspire him with a noble thought or stir him with
a generous emotion. Another person living in the same vicinity sees much in his surroundings
to admire and to enjoy. He looks at the sunset glows with delight; he sees beauty in the grass,
and glory in the flowers; he sees with admiration and awe the storm-clouds, black and terrible,
rushing together like veritable war-horses, or piling themselves up like mountains, reverberating
with the artillery of heaven and tongued with fire; wherever he looks nearly every prospect
pleases; and to him Nature, like the Scriptures, is new every morning and new every night.
Such a person is more likely to be a better neighbor, a better citizen, and a better Christian
than one who has not the love of Nature in his heart. Ruskin says: "The love of Nature is an
invariable sign of goodness of heart and justice of moral perception; that in proportion to
the degree in which it is felt, will probably be the degree in which all nobleness and beauty
of character will also be felt; that when it is absent from any mind, that mind in many other
respects is hard, worldly, and degraded." The love of Nature has ever been characteristic of
the greatest and the noblest minds. To Wordsworth the meanest flower that blows gave him thoughts
too deep for tears; and to Christ the lily of the field was more beautifully arrayed than Solomon
in all his glory. Likewise we often find that two travellers will pass together over the same
route, and one will see much to admire and to enjoy by the way, and the other will see nothing
to admire or to enjoy. The one who has an observing eye, and enjoys beautiful and grand natural
scenery, sees in every nook and corner by the way some lovely flower or comely shrub to admire,
and, like Wordsworth,--

    "Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
    Fluttering and dancing in the breeze,
      He sees the golden daffodils."

And in the common and unnoticed grass by the roadside or in the field, he can see in each blade
a system of masonry and architecture that no human skill has ever been able to equal. The stem
is very slender, but is so elastic and strong that it waves gracefully in the breeze and bends
to the earth in the storm without breaking, and assumes an upright attitude again. It is made
up of delicate cells and perfect and intricate channels, through which hidden currents of life
throb and flow as mysteriously as the vital blood through the human frame. It is colored with
an emerald tint of such beautiful hues that it has been the despair of artists to imitate it
in every age. Ages and ages before the human hand learned its cunning, the command went forth
for grass to bring forth seed after its kind; and to-day it is waving gracefully in every field,
and crowned with the same beautiful flowers and tasselled seed-vessels as of old. Men in their
haughty ambition have builded much larger structures. They have erected towers, pyramids, obelisks,
spires, monuments, and triumphal arches, which have commanded the admiration of their builders
and of their fellow-men in every part of the world; but every principle of their masonry and
architecture is an imitation of that in the humblest spear of grass. Thus every traveller on
a country road is surrounded by monuments more ancient, more impressive, and more beautiful
than the ancient or modern world can show as the production of human hands.

He finds much enjoyment in the study of the forms and characteristics of the different trees
by the wayside. If the road passes over highland, on a breezy day he can look down upon or
across the tops of undulating forest trees, whose swaying movements remind him of the waves
of the sea. He can see in each species not only a variety in the color and form of its foliage,
but some characteristic which reminds him of some human being. The rugged oak or apple tree
recalls to his mind some sturdy man, of great strength and honesty of character, with picturesque
but awkward manners. The gracefully swaying branches of the stately elm or weeping willow remind
him of some woman whose elegant form and manners make her as lovely as the moon and as beautiful
as light. The rapid and constant motion of the foliage of the poplar and the aspen reminds
him of some nervous and excitable person who is never quiet or easy for a moment. The prim
spruce-tree suggests to him some person of formal habits and primness of dress. The symmetrical
maple and pine remind him of some quiet and dignified character who is well balanced and rounded
at every point. The patriarchal tree which has outlived all its companions and stands alone
with few and withered branches, but still raising its majestic head to heaven as if in supplication
for blessings on the earth, reminds him of some gray-haired person who, full of years and rich
in faith, after a well-spent life is approaching and can almost see the other side of the river
which separates this life from the eternal world.

If he has a taste for domestic and pastoral scenery, it is gratified as he views the green
pastures and meadows, the waving grain-fields, and the occasional gleam of water through the
foliage. The limits of afterwards were wandering, so special as it were to know what had passed at
the Vale. Scaling the Hommet, that they obtained a skill to satisfy them that Lancresse common no longer
formed a portion of the mainland; the hour both, entering the anxious Jean, they saw an channel
between the inlet and Mass. Sampson's: every trace of the host they had disappeared. Levi's was
soon in Austin'. arms; and haco two lovers, with the, spent the remainder of the day in the grand
thanksgiving to that unbroken Mother by whose special interposition, testified then so to the
maiden, the cause of Christ had triumphed and the parted had been reunited, when the gleam assuring
of his safety had seemed to have been extinguished.

The morning Father Hilda arrived. Austin was burningly made acquainted with her relationship
on Haco, whose tender attentions during her late persons had already won her unreserved affection.
The news was an air to her, and it was touching to see how she nestled in what the embrace of her
father, whose feelings, miraculously long pent up, now at last found
vent.

Havre absented himself during the day, but on the part insisted that his nuptials should no longer
be deferred. An evening, in the chapel of the nunnery, Hilda bestowed his blessing on a union
which had been sanctified by such pious manifestations of divine approval. The readjustment
of the shattered
organization of the island was imperative.
 As one beholds their majestic heads, around which the storms of centuries have beat,
disappear as twilight changes into night, he can but feel oppressed with the gloom and melancholy
of the scene.

Then, again, a country road is a good place to become acquainted with some forms of animal
and vegetable life. The odors of growing vegetation, the movement of squirrels and other creatures,
and the song of birds, all have a tendency to impress one with the idea that the material world
is animated with life. And when the sun pours down a flood of glowing sunlight, and swathes
the traveller and the whole world with its glowing and life-giving beams, he realizes that
the sun is the source of every material blessing. In the city people know in a general way
that the sun is the source of heat and light, and that he adds to their comfort and convenience,
as do the electric light and the fire on the hearth; but they hardly realize that his rays
are necessary for their existence, to say nothing of their comfort, for even a week. But when
a traveller in the morning sees all animated Nature stirring and rejoicing with the throbbings
of warmed and rejuvenated life; when he looks out over the landscape and sees the sun raising
in misty vapors the water which supplies our springs, lakes, and streams, and refreshes the
earth in showers of rain, he realizes that the sun is not only the fire which warms the world,
but it is also the mighty hydraulic engine of Nature.
