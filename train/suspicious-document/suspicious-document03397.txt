MY VISIT TO NIAGARA.

Never did a pilgrim approach Niagara with deeper enthusiasm than mine. I had lingered away
from it, and wandered to other scenes, because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising
all the wonders of the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loath to exchange
the pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon.  At length the day came. The stage-coach,
with a Frenchman and myself on the back seat, had already left Lewiston, and in less than an
hour would set us down in Manchester.  I began to listen for the roar of the cataract, and
trembled with a sensation like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of ages must
roll, for the first time, on my ear.  The French gentleman stretched himself from the window,
and expressed loud admiration, while, by a sudden impulse, I threw myself back and closed my
eyes.  When the scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst of Niagara
was yet in futurity.  We rolled on, and entered the village of Manchester, bordering on the falls.

I am quite ashamed of myself here.  Not that I ran, like a madman to the falls, and plunged
into the thickest of the spray,--never stopping to breathe, till breathing was impossible:
not that I committed this, or any other suitable extravagance.  On the contrary, I alighted
with perfect decency and composure, gave my cloak to the black waiter, pointed out my baggage,
and inquired, not the nearest way to the cataract, but about the dinner-hour.  The interval
was spent in arranging my dress.  Within the last fifteen minutes, my mind had grown strangely
benumbed, and my spirits apathetic, with a slight depression, not decided enough to be termed
sadness.  My enthusiasm was in a deathlike slumber.  Without aspiring to immortality, as he
did, I could have imitated that English traveller, who turned back from the point where he
first heard the thunder of Niagara, after crossing the ocean to behold it.  Many a Western
trader, by the by, has performed a similar act of heroism with more heroic simplicity, deeming
it no such wonderful feat to dine at the hotel and resume his route to Buffalo or Lewiston,
while the cataract was roaring unseen.

Such has often been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and earnestly desired, were placed
within my reach.  After dinner--at which an unwonted and perverse epicurism detained me longer
than usual--I lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely attentive to the aspect and business
of a very ordinary village.  Finally, with reluctant step, and the feeling of an intruder,
I walked towards Goat Island.  At the tollhouse, there were further excuses for delaying the
inevitable moment.  My signature was required in a huge ledger, containing similar records
innumerable, many of which I read.  The skin of a great sturgeon, and other fishes, beasts,
and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins,
and other trifles, made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several newspapers from Montreal,
New York, and Boston;--all attracted me in turn.  Out of a number of twisted sticks, the manufacture
of a Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously convoluted, and adorned with
the carved images of a snake and a fish.  Using this as my pilgrim's staff, I crossed the bridge.
Above and below me were the rapids, a river of impetuous snow, with here and there a dark rock
amid its whiteness, resisting all the physical fury, as any cold spirit did the moral influences
of the scene.  On reaching Goat Island, which separates the two great segments of the falls,
I chose the right-hand path, and followed it to the edge of the American cascade.  There, while
the falling sheet was yet invisible, I saw the vapor that never vanishes, and the Eternal Rainbow
of Niagara.

It was an afternoon of glorious sunshine, without a cloud, save those of the cataracts.  I
gained an insulated rock, and beheld a broad sheet of brilliant and unbroken foam, not shooting
in a curved line from the top of the precipice, but falling headlong down from height to depth.
A narrow stream diverged from the main branch, and hurried over the crag by a channel of its
own, leaving a little pine-clad island and a streak of precipice, between itself and the larger
sheet.  Below arose the mist, on which was painted a dazzling sun-bow with two concentric shadows,--one,
almost as perfect as the original brightness; and the other, drawn faintly round the broken
edge of the cloud.

Still I  had not half seen Niagara.  Following the verge of the island, the path led me to
the Horseshoe, where the real, broad St. Lawrence, rushing along on a level with its banks,
pours its whole breadth over a concave line of precipice, and thence pursues its course between
lofty crags towards Ontario.  A sort of bridge, two or three feet wide, stretches out along
the edge of the descending sheet, and hangs upon the rising mist, as if that were the foundation
of the frail structure. Here I stationed myself in the blast of wind, which the rushing river
bore along with it.  The bridge was tremulous beneath me, and marked the tremor of the solid
earth.  I looked along the whitening rapids, and endeavored to distinguish a mass of water
far above the falls, to follow it to their verge, and go down with it, in fancy, to the abyss
of clouds and storm.  Casting my eyes across the river, and every side, I took in the whole
scene at a glance, and tried to comprehend it in one vast idea.  After an hour thus spent,
I left the bridge, and, by a staircase, winding almost interminably round a post, descended
to the base of the precipice.  From that point, my path lay over slippery stones, and among
great fragments of the cliff, to the edge of the cataract, where the wind at once enveloped
me in spray, and perhaps dashed the rainbow round me.  Were my long desires fulfilled?  And
had I seen Niagara?

O that I had never heard of Niagara till I beheld it!  Blessed were the wanderers of old, who
heard its deep roar, sounding through the woods, as the summons to an unknown wonder, and approached
its awful brink, in all the freshness of native feeling.  Had its own mysterious voice been
the first to warn me of its existence, then, indeed, I might have knelt down and worshipped.
But I had come thither, haunted with a vision of foam and fury, and dizzy cliffs, and an ocean
tumbling down out of the sky,--a scene, in short, which nature had too much good taste and
calm simplicity to realize.  My mind had struggled to adapt these false conceptions to the
reality, and finding the effort vain, a wretched sense of disappointment weighed me down. 
I climbed the precipice, and threw myself on the earth, feeling that I was unworthy to look
at the Great Falls, and careless about beholding them again.

All that night, as there has been and will be, for ages past and to come, a rushing sound was
heard, as if a great tempest were sweeping through the air.  It mingled with my dreams, and
made them full of storm and whirlwind.  Whenever I awoke, and heard this dread sound in the
air, and the windows rattling as with a mighty blast, I could not rest again, till looking
forth, I saw how bright the stars were, and that every leaf in the garden was motionless. 
Never was a summer night more calm to the eye, nor a gale of autumn louder to the ear.  The
rushing sound proceeds from the rapids, and the rattling of the casements is but an effect
of the vibration of the whole house, shaken by the jar of the cataract. The noise of the rapids
draws the attention from the true voice of Niagara, which is a dull, muffed thunder, resounding
between the cliffs. I spent a wakeful hour at midnight, in distinguishing its reverberations,
and rejoiced to find that my former awe and enthusiasm were reviving.

Gradually, and after much contemplation, I came to know, by my own feelings, that Niagara is
indeed a wonder of the world, and not the less wonderful, because time and thought must be
employed in comprehending it.  Casting aside all preconceived notions, and preparation to be
dire- struck or delighted, the beholder must stand beside it in the simplicity of his heart,
suffering the mighty scene to work its own impression. Night after night, I dreamed of it,
and was gladdened every morning by the consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it.  Yet
I will not pretend to the all-absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate spectators, nor deny
that very trifling causes would draw my eyes and thoughts from the cataract.

The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my departure for the Far West, I sat upon
the Table Rock.  This celebrated station did not now, as of old, project fifty feet beyond
the line of the precipice, but was shattered by the fall of an immense fragment, which lay
distant on the shore below.  Still, on the utmost verge of the rock, with my feet hanging over
it, I felt as if suspended in the open air.  Never before had my mind been in such perfect
unison with the scene.  There were intervals, when I was conscious of nothing but the great
river, rolling calmly into the abyss, rather descending than precipitating itself, and acquiring
tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion.  It came like the march of Destiny.  It was not
taken by surprise, but seemed to have anticipated, in all its course through the broad lakes,
that it must pour their collected waters down this height.  The perfect foam of the river,
after its descent, and the ever-varying shapes of mist, rising up, to become clouds in the
sky, would be the very picture of confusion, were it merely transient, like the rage of a tempest.
But when the beholder has stood awhile, and perceives no lull in the storm, and considers that
the vapor and the foam are as everlasting as the rocks which produce them, all this turmoil
assumes a sort of calmness.  It soothes, while it awes the mind.

Leaning over the cliff, I saw the guide conducting two adventurers behind the falls.  It was
pleasant, from that high seat in the sunshine, to observe them struggling against the eternal
storm of the lower regions, with heads bent down, now faltering, now pressing forward, and
finally swallowed up in their victory.  After their disappearance, a blast rushed out with
an old hat, which it had swept from one of their heads.  The rock, to which they were directing
their unseen course, is marked, at a fearful distance on the exterior of the sheet, by a jet
of foam.  The attempt to reach it appears both poetical and perilous to a looker-on, but may
be accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard, than in stemming a violent northeaster.
In a few moments, forth came the children of the mist.  Dripping and breathless, they crept
along the base of the cliff, ascended to the guide's cottage, and received, I presume, a certificate
of their achievement, with three verses of sublime poetry on the back.

In this manner I spent some hours, watching the varied impression, made by the cataract, on
those who disturbed me, and returning to unwearied contemplation, when left alone.  At length
my time came to depart. There is a grassy footpath, through the woods, along the summit of
the bank, to a point whence a causeway, hewn in the side of the precipice, goes winding down
to the Ferry, about half a mile below the Table Rock. The sun was near setting, when I emerged
from the shadow of the trees, and began the descent.  The indirectness of my downward road
continually changed the point of view, and showed me, in rich and repeated succession, now,
the whitening rapids and majestic leap of the main river, which appeared more deeply massive
as the light departed; now, the lovelier picture, yet still sublime, of Goat Island, with its
rocks and grove, and the lesser falls, tumbling over the right bank of the St. Lawrence, like
a tributary stream; now, the long vista of the river, as it eddied and whirled between the
cliffs, to pass through Ontario toward the sea, and everywhere to be wondered at, for this
one unrivalled scene.  The golden sunshine tinged the sheet of the American cascade, and painted
on its heaving spray the broken semicircle of a rainbow, heaven's own beauty crowning earth's
sublimity.  My steps were slow, and I paused long at every turn of the descent, as one lingers
and pauses, who discerns a brighter and brightening excellence in what he must soon behold
no more.  The solitude of the old wilderness now reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls.
My enjoyment became the more rapturous, because no poet shared it, nor wretch devoid of poetry
profaned it; but the spot so famous through the world was all my own!

THE ANTIQUE RING.

"Yes, indeed: the gem is as bright as a star, and curiously set," said Clara Pembertou, examining
an antique ring, which her betrothed lover had just presented to her, with a very pretty speech.
"It needs only one thing to make it perfect."

"And what is that?" asked Mr. Edward Caryl, secretly anxious for the credit of his gift.  "A
modern setting, perhaps?"

"O, no!  That would destroy the charm at once," replied Clara.  "It needs nothing but a story.
I long to know how many times it has been the pledge of faith between two lovers, and whether
the vows, of which it was the symbol, were always kept or often broken.  Not that I should
be too scrupulous about facts.  If you happen to be unacquainted with its authentic history,
so much the better.  May it not have sparkled upon a queen's finger?  Or who knows but it is
the very ring which Posthumus received from Imogen?  In short, you must kindle your imagination
at the lustre of this diamond, and make a legend for it."

Now such a task--and doubtless Clara knew it--was the most acceptable that could have been
imposed on Edward Caryl.  He was one of that multitude of young gentlemen--limbs, or rather
twigs of the law--whose names appear in gilt letters on the front of Tudor's Buildings, and
other places in the vicinity of the Court House, which seem to be the haunt of the gentler
as well as the severer Muses.  Edward, in the dearth of clients, was accustomed to employ his
much leisure in assisting the growth of American Literature, to which good cause he had contributed
not a few quires of the finest letter-paper, containing some thought, some fancy, some depth
of feeling, together with a young writer's abundance of conceits.  Sonnets, stanzas of Tennysonian
sweetness, tales imbued with German mysticism, versions from Jean Paul, criticisms of the old
English poets, and essays smacking of Dialistic philosophy, were among his multifarious productions.
The editors of the fashionable periodicals were familiar with his autograph, and inscribed
his name in those brilliant bead-rolls of ink-stained celebrity, which illustrate the first
page of their covers.  Nor did fame withhold her laurel.  Hillard had included him among the
lights of the New England metropolis, in his Boston Book; Bryant had found room for some of
his stanzas, in the Selections from American Poetry; and Mr. Griswold, in his recent assemblage
of the sons and daughters of song, had introduced Edward Caryl into the inner court of the
temple, among his fourscore choicest bards.  There was a prospect, indeed, of his assuming
a still higher and more independent position.  Interviews had been held with Ticknor, and a
correspondence with the Harpers, respecting a proposed volume, chiefly to consist of Mr. Caryl's
fugitive pieces in the Magazines, but to be accompanied with a poem of some length, never before
published.  Not improbably, the public may yet be gratified with this collection.

Meanwhile, we sum up our sketch of Edward Caryl, by pronouncing him, though somewhat of a carpet
knight in literature, yet no unfavorable specimen of a generation of rising writers, whose
spirit is such that we may reasonably expect creditable attempts from all, and good and beautiful
results from some.  And, it will be observed, Edward was the very man to write pretty legends,
at a lady's instance, for an old- fashioned diamond ring.  He took the jewel in his hand, and
turned it so as to catch its scintillating radiance, as if hoping, in accordance with Clara's
suggestion, to light up his fancy with that starlike gleam.

"Shall it be a ballad?--a tale in verse?" he inquired.  "Enchanted rings often glisten in old
English poetry, I think something may be done with the subject; but it is fitter for rhyme
than prose."

"No, no," said Miss Pemberton, "we will have no more rhyme than just enough for a posy to the
ring.  You must tell the legend in simple prose; and when it is finished, I will make a little
party to hear it read."

The young gentleman promised obedience; and going to his pillow, with his head full of the
familiar spirits that used to be worn in rings, watches, and sword-hilts, he had the good fortune
to possess himself of an available idea in a dream.  Connecting this with what he himself chanced
to know of the ring's real history, his task was done.  Clara Pemberton invited a select few
of her friends, all holding the stanchest faith in Edward's genius, and therefore the most
genial auditors, if not altogether the fairest critics, that a writer could possibly desire.
Blessed be woman for her faculty of admiration, and especially for her tendency to admire with
her heart, when man, at most, grants merely a cold approval with his mind!

Drawing his chair beneath the blaze of a solar lamp, Edward Caryl untied a roll of glossy paper,
and began as follows:--

THE LEGEND

After the death-warrant had been read to the Earl of Essex, and on the evening before his appointed
execution, the Countess of Shrewsbury paid his lordship a visit, and found him, as it appeared,
toying childishly with a ring.  The diamond, that enriched it, glittered like a little star,
but with a singular tinge of red.  The gloomy prison-chamber in the Tower, with its deep and
narrow windows piercing the walls of stone, was now all that the earl possessed of worldly
prospect; so that there was the less wonder that he should look steadfastly into the gem, and
moralize upon earth's deceitful splendor, as men in darkness and ruin seldom fail to do.  But
the shrewd observations of the countess,--an artful and unprincipled woman,--the pretended
friend of Essex, but who had come to glut her revenge for a deed of scorn which he himself
had forgotten,--her keen eye detected a deeper interest attached to this jewel.  Even while
expressing his gratitude for her remembrance of a ruined favorite, and condemned criminal,
the earl's glance reverted to the ring, as if all that remained of time and its affairs were
collected within that small golden circlet.

"My dear lord," observed the countess, "there is surely some matter of great moment wherewith
this ring is connected, since it, so absorbs your mind.  A token, it may be, of some fair lady's
love,--alas, poor lady, once richest in possessing such a heart!  Would you that the jewel
be returned to her?"

"The queen! the queen!  It was her Majesty's own gift," replied the earl, still gazing into
the depths of the gem.  "She took it from her finger, and told me, with a smile, that it was
an heirloom from her Tudor ancestors, and had once been the property of Merlin, the British
wizard, who gave it to the lady of his love.  His art had made this diamond the abiding-place
of a spirit, which, though of fiendish nature, was bound to work only good, so long as the
ring was an unviolated pledge of love and faith, both with the giver and receiver.  But should
love prove false, and faith be broken, then the evil spirit would work his own devilish will,
until the ring were purified by becoming the medium of some good and holy act, and again the
pledge of faithful love. The gem soon lost its virtue; for the wizard was murdered by the very
lady to whom he gave it."

"An idle legend!" said the countess.

"It is so," answered Essex, with a melancholy smile.  "Yet the queen's favor, of which this
ring was the symbol, has proved my ruin.  When death is nigh, men converse with dreams and
shadows.  I have been gazing into the diamond, and fancying--but you will laugh at me--that
I might catch a glimpse of the evil spirit there.  Do you observe this red glow,--dusky, too,
amid all the brightness?  It is the token of his presence; and even now, methinks, it grows
redder and duskier, like an angry sunset."

Nevertheless, the earl's manner testified how slight was his credence in the enchanted properties
of the ring.  But there is a kind of playfulness that comes in moments of despair, when the
reality of misfortune, if entirely felt, would crush the soul at once.  He now, for a brief
space, was lost in thought, while the countess contemplated him with malignant satisfaction.

"This ring," he resumed, in another tone, "alone remains, of all that my royal mistress's favor
lavished upon her servant.  My fortune once shone as brightly as the gem.  And now, such a
darkness has fallen around me, methinks it would be no marvel if its gleam--the sole light
of my prison-house--were to be forthwith extinguished; inasmuch as my last earthly hope depends
upon it."

"How say you, my lord?"  asked the Countess of Shrewsbury.  "The stone is bright; but there
should be strange magic in it, if it can keep your hopes alive, at this sad hour.  Alas! these
iron bars and ramparts of the Tower are unlike to yield to such a spell."

Essex raised his head involuntarily; for there was something in the countess's tone that disturbed
him, although he could not suspect that an enemy had intruded upon the sacred privacy of a
prisoner's dungeon, to exult over so dark a ruin of such once brilliant fortunes.  He looked
her in the face, but saw nothing to awaken his distrust.  It would have required a keener eye
than even Cecil's to read the secret of a countenance, which had been worn so long in the false
light of a court, that it was now little better than a mask, telling any story save the true
one.  The condemned nobleman again bent over the ring, and proceeded:

"It once had power in it,--this bright gem,--the magic that appertains to the talisman of a
great queen's favor.  She bade me, if hereafter I should fall into her disgrace,--how deep
soever, and whatever might be the crime,--to convey this jewel to her sight, and it should
plead for me.  Doubtless, with her piercing judgment, she had even then detected the rashness
of my nature, and foreboded some such deed as has now brought destruction upon my bead.  And
knowing, too, her own hereditary rigor, she designed, it may be, that the memory of gentler
and kindlier hours should soften her heart in my behalf, when my need should be the greatest.
I have doubted,--I have distrusted,--yet who can tell, even now, what happy influence this
ring might have?"

"You have delayed full long to show the ring, and plead her Majesty's gracious promise," remarked
the countess,--"your state being what it is."

"True," replied the earl: "but for my honor's sake, I was loath to entreat the queen's mercy,
while I might hope for life, at least, from the justice of the laws.  If, on a trial by my
peers, I had been acquitted of meditating violence against her sacred life, then would I have
fallen at her feet, and presenting the jewel, have prayed no other favor than that my love
and zeal should be put to the severest test. But now--it were confessing too much--it were
cringing too low--to beg the miserable gift of life, on no other score than the tenderness
which her Majesty deems one to have forfeited!"

"Yet it is your only hope," said the countess.

"And besides," continued Essex, pursuing his own reflections, "of what avail will be this token
of womanly feeling, when, on the other hand, are arrayed the all-prevailing motives of state
policy, and the artifices and intrigues of courtiers, to consummate my downfall?  Will Cecil
or Raleigh suffer her heart to act for itself, even if the spirit of her father were not in
her?  It is in vain to hope it."

But still Essex gazed at the ring with an absorbed attention, that proved how much hope his
sanguine temperament had concentrated here, when there was none else for him in the wide world,
save what lay in the compass of that hoop of gold.  The spark of brightness within the diamond,
which gleamed like an intenser than earthly fire, was the memorial of his dazzling career.
It had not paled with the waning sunshine of his mistress's favor; on the contrary, in spite
of its remarkable tinge of dusky red, he fancied that it never shone so brightly.  The glow
of festal torches,--the blaze of perfumed lamps,-- bonfires that had been kindled for him,
when he was the darling of the people,--the splendor of the royal court, where he had been
the peculiar star,--all seemed to have collected their moral or material glory into the gem,
and to burn with a radiance caught from the future, as well as gathered from the past.  That
radiance might break forth again. Bursting from the diamond, into which it was now narrowed,
it might been first upon the gloomy walls of the Tower,--then wider, wider, wider,-- till all
England, and the seas around her cliffs, should be gladdened with the light.  It was such an
ecstasy as often ensues after long depression, and has been supposed to precede the circumstances
of darkest fate that may befall mortal man.  The earl pressed the ring to his heart as if it
were indeed a talisman, the habitation of a spirit, as the queen had playfully assured him,--but
a spirit of happier influences than her legend spake of.

"O, could I but make my way to her footstool!"  cried he, waving his hand aloft, while he paced
the stone pavement of his prison-chamber with an impetuous step.  "I might kneel down, indeed,
a ruined man, condemned to the block, but how should I rise again?  Once more the favorite
of Elizabeth!--England's proudest noble!--with such prospects as ambition never aimed at! 
Why have I tarried so long in this weary dungeon?  The ring has power to set me free!  The
palace wants me!  Ho, jailer, unbar the door!"

But then occurred the recollection of the impossibility of obtaining an interview with his
fatally estranged mistress, and testing the influence over her affections, which he still flattered
himself with possessing. Could he step beyond the limits of his prison, the world would be
all sunshine; but here was only gloom and death.

"Alas!" said he, slowly and sadly, letting his head fall upon his hands. "I die for the lack
of one blessed word."

The Countess of Shrewsbury, herself forgotten amid the earl's gorgeous visions, had watched
him with an aspect that could have betrayed nothing to the most suspicious observer; unless
that it was too calm for humanity, while witnessing the flutterings, as it were, of a generous
heart in the death-agony.  She now approached him.

"My good lord," she said, "what mean you to do?"

"Nothing,--my deeds are done!" replied he, despondingly; "yet, had a fallen favorite any friends,
I would entreat one of them to lay this ring at her Majesty's feet; albeit with little hope,
save that, hereafter, it might remind her that poor Essex, once far too highly favored, was
at last too severely dealt with."

"I will be that friend," said the countess.  "There is no time to be lost.  Trust this precious
ring with me.  This very night the queen's eye shall rest upon it; nor shall the efficacy of
my poor words be wanting, to strengthen the impression which it will doubtless make."

The earl's first impulse was to hold out the ring.  But looking at the countess, as she bent
forward to receive it, he fancied that the red glow of the gem tinged all her face, and gave
it an ominous expression. Many passages of past times recurred to his memory.  A preternatural
insight, perchance caught from approaching death, threw its momentary gleam, as from a meteor,
all round his position.

"Countess," he said, "I know not wherefore I hesitate, being in a plight so desperate, and
having so little choice of friends.  But have you looked into your own heart?  Can you perform
this office with the truth --the earnestness--time--zeal, even to tears, and agony of spirit--
wherewith the holy gift of human life should be pleaded for?  Woe be unto you, should you undertake
this task, and deal towards me otherwise than with utmost faith!  For your own soul's sake,
and as you would have peace at your death-hour, consider well in what spirit you receive this
ring!"

The countess did not shrink.

"My lord!--my good lord!" she exclaimed, "wrong not a woman's heart by these suspicious.  You
might choose another messenger; but who, save a lady of her bedchamber, can obtain access to
the queen at this untimely hour?  It is for your life,--for your life,--else I would not renew
my offer."

"Take the ring," said the earl.

"Believe that it shall be in the queen's hands before the lapse of another hour," replied the
countess, as she received this sacred trust of life and death.  "To-morrow morning look for
the result of my intercession."

She departed.  Again the earl's hopes rose high.  Dreams visited his slumber, not of the sable-decked
scaffold in the Tower-yard, but of canopies of state, obsequious courtiers, pomp, splendor,
the smile of the once more gracious queen, and a light beaming from the magic gem, which illuminated
his whole future.

History records how foully the Countess of Shrewsbury betrayed the trust, which Essex, in his
utmost need, confided to her.  She kept the ring, and stood in the presence of Elizabeth, that
night, without one attempt to soften her stern hereditary temper in behalf of the former favorite.
The next day the earl's noble head rolled upon the scaffold. On her death-bed, tortured, at
last, with a sense of the dreadful guilt which she had taken upon her soul, the wicked countess
sent for Elizabeth, revealed the story of the ring, and besought forgiveness for her treachery.
But the queen, still obdurate, even while remorse for past obduracy was tugging at her heart-strings,
shook the dying woman in her bed, as if struggling with death for the privilege of wreaking
her revenge and spite.  The spirit of the countess passed away, to undergo the justice, or
receive the mercy, of a higher tribunal; and tradition says, that the fatal ring was found
upon her breast, where it had imprinted a dark red circle, resembling the effect of the intensest
heat.  The attendants, who prepared the body for burial, shuddered, whispering one to another,
that the ring must have derived its heat from the glow of infernal fire.  They left it on her
breast, in the coffin, and it went with that guilty woman to the tomb.

Many years afterward, when the church, that contained the monuments of the Shrewsbury family,
was desecrated by Cromwell's soldiers, they broke open the ancestral vaults, and stole whatever
was valuable from the noble personages who reposed there.  Merlin's antique ring passed into
the possession of a stout sergeant of the Ironsides, who thus became subject to the influences
of the evil spirit that still kept his abode within the gem's enchanted depths.  The sergeant
was soon slain in battle, thus transmitting the ring, though without any legal form of testament,
to a gay cavalier, who forthwith pawned it, and expended the money in liquor, which speedily
brought him to the grave.  We next catch the sparkle of the magic diamond at various epochs
of the merry reign of Charles the Second.  But its sinister fortune still attended it.  From
whatever hand this ring of portent came, and whatever finger it encircled, ever it was the
pledge of deceit between man and man, or man and woman, of faithless vows, and unhallowed passion;
and whether to lords and ladies, or to village-maids,--for sometimes it found its way so low,--still
it brought nothing but sorrow and disgrace.  No purifying deed was done, to drive the fiend
from his bright home in this little star.  Again, we hear of it at a later period, when Sir
Robert Walpole bestowed the ring, among far richer jewels, on the lady of a British legislator,
whose political honor he wished to undermine.  Many a dismal and unhappy tale might be wrought
out of its other adventures.  All this while, its ominous tinge of dusky red had been deepening
and darkening, until, if laid upon white paper, it cast the mingled hue of night and blood,
strangely illuminated with scintillating light, in a circle round about.  But this peculiarity
only made it the more valuable.

Alas, the fatal ring!  When shall its dark secret be discovered, and the doom of ill, inherited
from one possessor to another, be finally revoked?

The legend now crosses the Atlantic, and comes down to our own immediate time.  In a certain
church of our city, not many evenings ago, there was a contribution for a charitable object.
A fervid preacher had poured out his whole soul in a rich and tender discourse, which had at
least excited the tears, and perhaps the more effectual sympathy, of a numerous audience. 
While the choristers sang sweetly, and the organ poured forth its melodious thunder, the deacons
passed up and down the aisles, and along the galleries, presenting their mahogany boxes, in
which each person deposited whatever sum he deemed it safe to lend to the Lord, in aid of human
wretchedness.  Charity became audible,--chink, chink, chink,--as it fell, drop by drop, into
the common receptacle. There was a hum,--a stir,--the subdued bustle of people putting their
hands into their pockets; while, ever and anon, a vagrant coin fell upon the floor, and rolled
away, with long reverberation, into some inscrutable corner.

At length, all having been favored with an opportunity to be generous, the two deacons placed
their boxes on the communion-table, and thence, at the conclusion of the services, removed
them into the vestry.  Here these good old gentlemen sat down together, to reckon the accumulated
treasure.

"Fie, fie, Brother Tilton," said Deacon Trott, peeping into Deacon Tilton's box, "what a heap
of copper you have picked up!  Really, for an old man, you must have had a heavy job to lug
it along.  Copper! copper! copper!  Do people expect to get admittance into heaven at the price
of a few coppers?"

"Don't wrong them, brother," answered Deacon Tilton, a simple and kindly old man.  "Copper
may do more for one person, than gold will for another.  In the galleries, where I present
my box, we must not expect such a harvest as you gather among the gentry in the broad aisle,
and all over the floor of the church.  My people are chiefly poor mechanics and laborers, sailors,
seamstresses, and servant-maids, with a most uncomfortable intermixture of roguish school-boys."

"Well, well," said Deacon Trott; "but there is a great deal, Brother Tilton, in the method
of presenting a contribution-box.  It is a knack that comes by nature, or not at all."

They now proceeded to sum up the avails of the evening, beginning with the receipts of Deacon
Trott.  In good sooth, that worthy personage had reaped an abundant harvest, in which he prided
himself no less, apparently, than if every dollar had been contributed from his own individual
pocket.  Had the good deacon been meditating a jaunt to Texas, the treasures of the mahogany
box might have sent him on his way rejoicing.  There were bank-notes, mostly, it is true, of
the smallest denominations in the giver's pocket-book, yet making a goodly average upon the
whole.  The most splendid contribution was a check for a hundred dollars, bearing the name
of a distinguished merchant, whose liberality was duly celebrated in the newspapers of the
next day.  No less than seven half-eagles, together with an English sovereign, glittered amidst
an indiscriminate heap of silver; the box being polluted with nothing of the copper kind, except
a single bright new cent, wherewith a little boy had performed his first charitable act.

"Very well! very well indeed!" said Deacon Trott, self-approvingly. "A handsome evening's work!
And now, Brother Tilton, let's see whether you can match it."  Here was a sad contrast!  They
poured forth Deacon Tilton's treasure upon the table, and it really seemed as if the whole
copper coinage of the country, together with an amazing quantity of shop-keeper's tokens, and
English and Irish half-pence, mostly of base metal, had been congregated into the box.  There
was a very substantial pencil-case, and the semblance of a shilling; but he latter proved to
be made of tin, and the former of German-silver.  A gilded brass button was doing duty as a
gold coin, and a folded shopbill had assumed the character of a bank-note.  But Deacon Tilton's
feelings were much revived by the aspect of another bank-note, new and crisp, adorned with
beautiful engravings, and stamped with the indubitable word, TWENTY, in large black letters.
Alas! it was a counterfeit.  In short, the poor old Deacon was no less unfortunate than those
who trade with fairies, and whose gains are sure to be transformed into dried leaves, pebbles,
and other valuables of that kind.

"I believe the Evil One is in the box," said he, with some vexation.

"Well done, Deacon Tilton!" cried his Brother Trott, with a hearty laugh.  "You ought to have
a statue in copper."

"Never mind, brother," replied the good Deacon, recovering his temper. "I'll bestow ten dollars
from my own pocket, and may heaven's blessing go along with it.  But look!  what do you call this?"

Under the copper mountain, which it had cost them so much toil to remove, lay an antique ring!
It was enriched with a diamond, which, so soon as it caught the light, began to twinkle and
glimmer, emitting the whitest and purest lustre that could possibly be conceived.--It was as
brilliant as if some magician had condensed the brightest star in heaven into a compass fit
to be set in a ring, for a lady's delicate finger.

"How is this?" said Deacon Trott, examining it carefully, in the expectation of finding it
as worthless as the rest of his colleague's treasure.  "Why, upon my word, this seems to be
a real diamond, and of the purest water.  Whence could it have come?"

"Really, I cannot tell," quoth Deacon Tilton, "for my spectacles were so misty that all faces
looked alike.  But now I remember, there was a flash of light came from the box, at one moment;
but it seemed a dusky red, instead of a pure white, like the sparkle of this gem.  Well; the
ring will make up for the copper; but I wish the giver had thrown its history into the box
along with it."

It has been our good luck to recover a portion of that history.  After transmitting misfortune
from one possessor to another, ever since the days of British Merlin, the identical ring which
Queen Elizabeth gave to the Earl of Essex was finally thrown into the contribution-box of a
New England church.  The two deacons deposited it in the glass case of a fashionable jeweller,
of whom it was purchased by the humble rehearser of this legend, in the hope that it may be
allowed to sparkle on a fair lady's finger.  Purified from the foul fiend, so long its inhabitant,
by a deed of unostentatious charity, and now made the symbol of faithful and devoted love,
the gentle bosom of its new possessor need fear no sorrow from its influence.

Very pretty!--Beautiful!--How original!--How sweetly written!--What nature!--What imagination!--What
power!--What pathos!--What exquisite humor!"--were the exclamations of Edward Caryl's kind
and generous auditors, at the conclusion of the legend.

"It is a pretty tale," said Miss Pemberton, who, conscious that her praise was to that of all
others as a diamond to a pebble, was therefore the less liberal in awarding it.  "It is really
a pretty tale, and very proper for any of the Annuals.  But, Edward, your moral does not satisfy
me.  What thought did you embody in the ring?"

"O Clara, this is too bad!" replied Edward, with a half-reproachful smile.  "You know that
I can never separate the idea from the symbol in which it manifests itself.  However, we may
suppose the Gem to be the human heart, and the Evil Spirit to be Falsehood, which, in one guise
or another, is the fiend that causes all the sorrow and trouble in the world.  I beseech you
to let this suffice."

"It shall," said Clara, kindly.  "And, believe me, whatever the world may say of the story,
I prize it far above the diamond which enkindled your imagination."

GRAVES AND GOBLINS.

Now talk we of graves and goblins!  Fit themes,--start not! gentle reader,--fit for a ghost
like me.  Yes; though an earth-clogged fancy is laboring with these conceptions, and an earthly
hand will write them down, for mortal eyes to read, still their essence flows from as airy
a ghost as ever basked in the pale starlight, at twelve o'clock.  Judge them not by the gross
and heavy form in which they now appear.  They may be gross, indeed, with the earthly pollution
contracted from the brain, through which they pass; and heavy with the burden of mortal language,
that crushes all the finer intelligences of the soul.  This is no fault of mine.  But should
aught of ethereal spirit be perceptible, yet scarcely so, glimmering along the dull train of
words,--should a faint perfume breathe from the mass of clay,--then, gentle reader, thank the
ghost, who thus embodies himself for your sake!  Will you believe me, if I say that all true
and noble thoughts, and elevated imaginations, are but partly the offspring of the intellect
which seems to produce them? Sprites, that were poets once, and are now all poetry, hover round
the dreaming bard, and become his inspiration; buried statesmen lend their wisdom, gathered
on earth and mellowed in the grave, to the historian; and when the preacher rises nearest to
the level of his mighty subject, it is because the prophets of old days have communed with
him.  Who has not been conscious of mysteries within his mind, mysteries of truth and reality,
which will not wear the chains of language?  Mortal, then the dead were with you!  And thus
shall the earth-dulled soul, whom I inspire, be conscious of a misty brightness among his thoughts,
and strive to make it gleam upon the page,--but all in vain.  Poor author! How will he despise
what he can grasp, for the sake of the dim glory that eludes him!

So talk we of graves and goblins.  But, what have ghosts to do with graves?  Mortal man, wearing
the dust which shall require a sepulchre, might deem it more a home and resting-place than
a spirit can, whose earthly clod has returned to earth.  Thus philosophers have reasoned. Yet
wiser they who adhere to the ancient sentiment, that a phantom haunts and hallows the marble
tomb or grassy hillock where its material form was laid.  Till purified from each stain of
clay; till the passions of the living world are all forgotten; till it have less brotherhood
with the wayfarers of earth, than with spirits that never wore mortality,--the ghost must linger
round the grave.  O, it is a long and dreary watch to some of us!

Even in early childhood, I had selected a sweet spot, of shade and glimmering sunshine, for
my grave.  It was no burial-ground, but a secluded nook of virgin earth, where I used to sit,
whole summer afternoons, dreaming about life and death.  My fancy ripened prematurely, and
taught me secrets which I could not otherwise have known.  I pictured the coming years,--they
never came to me, indeed; but I pictured them like life, and made this spot the scene of all
that should be brightest, in youth, manhood, and old age.  There, in a little while, it would
be time for me to breathe the bashful and burning vows of first-love; thither, after gathering
fame abroad, I would return to enjoy the loud plaudit of the world, a vast but unobtrusive
sound, like the booming of a distant sea; and thither, at the far-off close of life, an aged
man would come, to dream, as the boy was dreaming, and be as happy in the past as lie was in
futurity.  Finally, when all should be finished, in that spot so hallowed, in that soil so
impregnated with the most precious of my bliss, there was to be my grave.  Methought it would
be the sweetest grave that ever a mortal frame reposed in, or an ethereal spirit haunted. 
There, too, in future times, drawn thither by the spell which I had breathed around the place,
boyhood would sport and dream, and youth would love, and manhood would enjoy, and age would
dream again, and my ghost would watch but never frighten them.  Alas, the vanity of mortal
projects, even when they centre in the grave!  I died in my first youth, before I had been
a lover; at a distance, also, from the grave which fancy had dug for me; and they buried me
in the thronged cemetery of a town, where my marble slab stands unnoticed amid a hundred others.
And there are coffins on each side of mine!

"Alas, poor ghost!" will the reader say.  Yet I am a happy ghost enough, and disposed to be
contented with my grave, if the sexton will but let it be my own, and bring no other dead man
to dispute my title.  Earth has left few stains upon me, and it will be but a short time that
I need haunt the place.  It is good to die in early youth.  Had I lived out threescore years
and ten, or half of them, my spirit would have been so earth-incrusted, that centuries might
not have purified it for a better home than the dark precincts of the grave.  Meantime, there
is good choice of company amongst us.  From twilight till near sunrise, we are gliding to and
fro, some in the graveyard, others miles away; and would we speak with any friend, we do but
knock against his tombstone, and pronounce the name engraved on it: in an instant, there the
shadow stands!

Some are ghosts of considerable antiquity.  There is an old man, hereabout; he never had a
tombstone, and is often puzzled to distinguish his own grave; but hereabouts he haunts, and
long is doomed to haunt. He was a miser in his lifetime, and buried a strong box of ill-gotten
gold, almost fresh from the mint, in the coinage of William and Mary. Scarcely was it safe,
when the sexton buried the old man and his secret with him.  I could point out the place where
the treasure lies; it was at the bottom of the miser's garden; but a paved thoroughfare now
passes beside the spot, and the cornerstone of a market-house presses right down upon it. 
Had the workmen dug six inches deeper, they would have found the hoard.  Now thither must this
poor old miser go, whether in starlight, moonshine, or pitch darkness, and brood above his
worthless treasure, recalling all the petty crimes by which he gained it.  Not a coin must
he fail to reckon in his memory, nor forget a pennyworth of the sin that made up the sum, though
his agony is such as if the pieces of gold, red-hot, were stamped into his naked soul.  Often,
while he is in torment there, he hears the steps of living men, who love the dross of earth
as well as he did.  May they never groan over their miserable wealth like him!  Night after
night, for above a hundred years, hath he done this penance, and still must he do it, till
the iron box be brought to light, and each separate coin be cleansed by grateful tears of a
widow or an orphan.  My spirit sighs for his long vigil at the corner of the market-house!

There are ghosts whom I tremble to meet, and cannot think of without a shudder.  One has the
guilt of blood upon him.  The soul which he thrust untimely forth has long since been summoned
from our gloomy graveyard, and dwells among the stars of heaven, too far and too high for even
the recollection of mortal anguish to ascend thither.  Not so the murderer's ghost!  It is
his doom to spend all the hours of darkness in the spot which he stained with innocent blood,
and to feel the hot stream--hot as when it first gushed upon his hand--incorporating itself
with his spiritual substance.  Thus his horrible crime is ever fresh within him. Two other
wretches are condemned to walk arm in arm.  They were guilty lovers in their lives, and still,
in death, must wear the guise of love, though hatred and loathing have become their very nature
and existence. The pollution of their mutual sin remains with them, and makes their souls sick
continually.  O, that I might forget all the dark shadows which haunt about these graves! 
This passing thought of them has left a stain, and will weigh me down among dust and sorrow,
beyond the time that my own transgressions would have kept me here. There is one shade among
us, whose high nature it is good to meditate upon.  He lived a patriot, and is a patriot still.
Posterity has forgotten him.  The simple slab, of red freestone, that bore his name, was broken
long ago, and is now covered by the gradual accumulation of the soil.  A tuft of thistles is
his only monument. This upright spirit came to his grave, after a lengthened life, with so
little stain of earth, that he might, almost immediately, have trodden the pathway of the sky.
But his strong love of country chained him down, to share its vicissitudes of weal or woe.
With such deep yearning in his soul, he was unfit for heaven. That noblest virtue has the effect
of sin, and keeps his pure and lofty spirit in a penance, which may not terminate till America
be again a wilderness.  Not that there is no joy for the dead patriot.  Can he fail to experience
it, while be contemplates the mighty and increasing power of the land, which be protected in
its infancy?  No; there is much to gladden him.  But sometimes I dread to meet him, as he returns
from the bedchambers of rulers and politicians, after diving into their secret motives, and
searching out their aims.  He looks round him with a stern and awful sadness, and vanishes
into his neglected grave.  Let nothing sordid or selfish defile your deeds or thoughts, ye
great men of the day, lest ye grieve the noble dead.

Few ghosts take such an endearing interest as this, even in their own private affairs.  It
made me rather sad, at first, to find how soon the flame of love expires amid the chill damps
of the tomb; so much the sooner, the more fiercely it may have burned.  Forget your dead mistress,
youth!  She has already forgotten you.  Maiden, cease to weep for your buried lover!  He will
know nothing of your tears, nor value them if he did.  Yet it were blasphemy to say that true
love is other than immortal.  It is an earthly passion, of which I speak, mingled with little
that is spiritual, and must therefore perish with the perishing clay.  When souls have loved,
there is no falsehood or forgetfulness. Maternal affection, too, is strong as adamant.  There
are mothers here, among us, who might have been in heaven fifty years ago, if they could forbear
to cherish earthly joy and sorrow, reflected from the bosoms of their children.  Husbands and
wives have a comfortable gift of oblivion, especially when secure of the faith of their living
halves.  Jealousy, it is true, will play the devil with a ghost, driving him to the bedside
of secondary wedlock, there to scowl, unseen, and gibber inaudible remonstrances.  Dead wives,
however jealous in their lifetime, seldom feel this posthumous torment so acutely.

Many, many things, that appear most important while we walk the busy street, lose all their
interest the moment we are borne into the quiet graveyard which borders it.  For my own part,
my spirit had not become so mixed up with earthly existence, as to be now held in an unnatural
combination, or tortured much with retrospective cares.  I still love my parents and a younger
sister, who remain among the living, and often grieve me by their patient sorrow for the dead.
Each separate tear of theirs is an added weight upon my soul, and lengthens my stay among the
graves.  As to other matters, it exceedingly rejoices me, that my summons came before I had
time to write a projected poem, which was highly imaginative in conception, and could not have
failed to give me a triumphant rank in the choir of our native bards.  Nothing is so much to
be deprecated as posthumous renown.  It keeps the immortal spirit from the proper bliss of
his celestial state, and causes him to feed upon the impure breath of mortal man, till sometimes
he forgets that there are starry realms above him.  Few poets--infatuated that they are!--soar
upward while the least whisper of their name is heard on earth.  On Sabbath evenings, my sisters
sit by the fireside, between our father and mother, and repeat some hymns of mine, which they
have often heard from my own lips, ere the tremulous voice left them forever.  Little do they
think, those dear ones, that the dead stands listening in the glimmer of the firelight, and
is almost gifted with a visible shape by the fond intensity of their remembrance.

Now shall the reader know a grief of the poor ghost that speaks to him; a grief, but not a
helpless one.  Since I have dwelt among the graves, they bore the corpse of a young maiden
hither, and laid her in the old ancestral vault, which is hollowed in the side of a grassy
bank.  It has a door of stone, with rusty iron hinges, and above it, a rude sculpture of the
family arms, and inscriptions of all their names who have been buried there, including sire
and son, mother and daughter, of an ancient colonial race.  All of her lineage had gone before,
and when the young maiden followed, the portal was closed forever.  The night after her burial,
when the other ghosts were flitting about their graves, forth came the pale virgin's shadow,
with the rest, but knew not whither to go, nor whom to haunt, so lonesome had she been on earth.
She stood by the ancient sepulchre, looking upward to the bright stars, as if she would, even
then, begin her flight.  Her sadness made me sad.  That night and the next, I stood near her,
in the moonshine, but dared not speak, because she seemed purer than all the ghosts, and fitter
to converse with angels than with men.  But the third bright eve, still gazing upward to the
glory of the heavens, she sighed, and said, "When will my mother come for me?"  Her low, sweet
voice emboldened me to speak, and she was kind and gentle, though so pure, and answered me
again.  From that time, always at the ghostly hour, I sought the old tomb of her fathers, and
either found her standing by the door, or knocked, and she appeared.  Blessed creature, that
she was; her chaste spirit hallowed mine, and imparted such a celestial buoyancy, that I longed
to grasp her hand, and fly,--upward, aloft, aloft!  I thought, too, that she only lingered
here, till my earthlier soul should be purified for heaven.  One night, when the stars threw
down the light that shadows love, I stole forth to the accustomed spot, and knocked, with my
airy fingers, at her door.  She answered not.  Again I knocked, and breathed her name.  Where
was she?  At once, the truth fell on my miserable spirit, and crushed it to the earth, among
dead men's bones and mouldering dust, groaning in cold and desolate agony.  Her penance was
over!  She had taken her trackless flight, and had found a home in the purest radiance of the
upper stars, leaving me to knock at the stone portal of the darksome sepulchre.  But I know--I
know, that angels hurried her away, or surely she would have whispered ere she fled!

She is gone!  How could the grave imprison that unspotted one!  But her pure, ethereal spirit
will not quite forget me, nor soar too high in bliss, till I ascend to join her.  Soon, soon
be that hour!  I am weary of the earth-damps; they burden me; they choke me!  Already, I can
float in the moonshine; the faint starlight will almost bear up my footsteps; the perfume of
flowers, which grosser spirits love, is now too earthly a luxury for me.  Grave!  Grave! thou
art not my home.  I must flit a little longer in thy night gloom, and then be gone,--far from
the dust of the living and the dead,--far from the corruption that is around me, but no more
within!

A few times, I have visited the chamber of one who walks, obscure and lonely, on his mortal
pilgrimage.  He will leave not many living friends, when he goes to join the dead, where his
thoughts often stray, and he might better be.  I steal into his sleep, and play my part among
the figures of his dreams.  I glide through the moonlight of his waking fancy, and whisper
conceptions, which, with a strange thrill of fear, he writes down as his own.  I stand beside
him now, at midnight, telling these dreamy truths with a voice so dream-like, that he mistakes
them for fictions of a brain too prone to such.  Yet he glances behind him and shivers, while
the lamp burns pale.  Farewell, dreamer,--waking or sleeping!  Your brightest dreams are fled;
your mind grows too hard and cold for a spiritual guest to enter; you are earthly, too, and
have all the sins of earth.  The ghost will visit you no more.

But where is the maiden, holy and pure, though wearing a form of clay, that would have me bend
over her pillow at midnight, and leave a blessing there?  With a silent invocation, let her
summon me.  Shrink not, maiden, when I come!  In life, I was a high-souled youth, meditative,
yet seldom sad, full of chaste fancies, and stainless from all grosser sin.  And now, ill death,
I bring no loathsome smell of the grave, nor ghostly terrors,--but gentle, and soothing, and
sweetly pensive influences.  Perhaps, just fluttering for the skies, my visit may hallow the
wellsprings of thy thought, and make thee heavenly here on earth.  Then shall pure dreams and
holy meditations bless thy life; nor thy sainted spirit linger round the grave, but seek the
upper stars, and meet me there!
