THE CROSS-CUT

CHAPTER I

It was over.  The rambling house, with its rickety, old-fashioned furniture--and its memories--was
now deserted, except for Robert Fairchild, and he was deserted within it, wandering from room
to room, staring at familiar objects with the unfamiliar gaze of one whose vision suddenly
has been warned by the visitation of death and the sense of loneliness that it brings.

Loneliness, rather than grief, for it had been Robert Fairchild's promise that he would not
suffer in heart for one who had longed to go into a peace for which he had waited, seemingly
in vain.  Year after year, Thornton Fairchild had sat in the big armchair by the windows, watching
the days grow old and fade into night, studying sunset after sunset, voicing the vain hope
that the gloaming might bring the twilight of his own existence,--a silent man except for this,
rarely speaking of the past, never giving to the son who worked for him, cared for him, worshiped
him, the slightest inkling of what might have happened in the dim days of the long ago to transform
him into a beaten thing, longing for the final surcease.  And when the end came, it found him
in readiness, waiting in the big armchair by the windows.  Even now, a book lay on the frayed
carpeting of the old room, where it had fallen from relaxing fingers.  Robert Fairchild picked
it up, and with a sigh restored it to the grim, fumed oak case.  His days of petty sacrifices
that his father might while away the weary hours with reading were over.

Memories!  They were all about him, in the grate with its blackened coals, the old-fashioned
pictures on the walls, the almost gloomy rooms, the big chair by the window, and yet they told
him nothing except that a white-haired, patient, lovable old man was gone,--a man whom he was
wont to call "father."  And in that going, the slow procedure of an unnatural existence had
snapped for Robert Fairchild. As he roamed about in his loneliness, he wondered what he would
do now, where he could go; to whom he could talk.  He had worked since sixteen, and since sixteen
there had been few times when he had not come home regularly each night, to wait upon the white-haired
man in the big chair, to discern his wants instinctively, and to sit with him, often in silence,
until the old onyx clock on the mantel had clanged eleven; it had been the same program, day,
week, month and year.  And now Robert Fairchild was as a person lost.  The ordinary pleasures
of youth had never been his; he could not turn to them with any sort of grace. The years of
servitude to a beloved master had inculcated within him the feeling of self-impelled sacrifice;
he had forgotten all thought of personal pleasures for their sake alone.  The big chair by
the window was vacant, and it created a void which Robert Fairchild could neither combat nor
overcome.

What had been the past?  Why the silence?  Why the patient, yet impatient wait for death? 
The son did not know.  In all his memories was only one faint picture, painted years before
in babyhood: the return of his father from some place, he knew not where, a long conference
with his mother behind closed doors, while he, in childlike curiosity, waited without, seeking
in vain to catch some explanation. Then a sad-faced woman who cried at night when the house
was still, who faded and who died.  That was all.  The picture carried no explanation.

And now Robert Fairchild stood on the threshold of something he almost feared to learn.  Once,
on a black, stormy night, they had sat together, father and son before the fire, silent for
hours.  Then the hand of the white-haired man had reached outward and rested for a moment on
the young man's knee.

"I wrote something to you, Boy, a day or so ago," he had said.  "That little illness I had
prompted me to do it.  I--I thought it was only fair to you.  After I 'm gone, look in the
safe.  You 'll find the combination on a piece of paper hidden in a hole cut in that old European
history in the bookcase.  I have your promise, I know--that you 'll not do it until after I
'm gone."

Now Thornton Fairchild was gone.  But a message had remained behind; one which the patient
lips evidently had feared to utter during life. The heart of the son began to pound, slow and
hard, as, with the memory of that conversation, he turned toward the bookcase and unlatched
the paneled door.  A moment more and the hollowed history had given up its trust, a bit of
paper scratched with numbers.  Robert Fairchild turned toward the stairs and the small room
on the second floor which had served as his father's bedroom.

There he hesitated before the little iron safe in the corner, summoning the courage to unlock
the doors of a dead man's past.  At last he forced himself to his knees and to the numerals
of the combination.

The safe had not been opened in years; that was evident from the creaking of the plungers as
they fell, the gummy resistance of the knob as Fairchild turned it in accordance with the directions
on the paper. Finally, a great wrench, and the bolt was drawn grudgingly back; a strong pull,
and the safe opened.

A few old books; ledgers in sheepskin binding.  Fairchild disregarded these for the more important
things that might lie behind the little inner door of the cabinet.  His hand went forward,
and he noticed, in a hazy sort of way, that it was trembling.  The door was unlocked; he drew
it open and crouched a moment, staring, before he reached for the thinner of two envelopes
which lay before him.  A moment later he straightened and turned toward the light.  A crinkling
of paper, a quick-drawn sigh between clenched teeth; it was a letter; his strange, quiet, hunted-appearing
father was talking to him through the medium of ink and paper, after death.

Closely written, hurriedly, as though to finish an irksome task in as short a space as possible,
the missive was one of several pages,--pages which Robert Fairchild hesitated to read.  The
secret--and he knew full well that there was a secret--had been in the atmosphere about him
ever since he could remember.  Whether or not this was the solution of it, Robert Fairchild
did not know, and the natural reticence with which he had always approached anything regarding
his father's life gave him an instinctive fear, a sense of cringing retreat from anything that
might now open the doors of mystery.  But it was before him, waiting in his father's writing,
and at last his gaze centered; he read:

My son:

Before I begin this letter to you I must ask that you take no action whatever until you have
seen my attorney--he will be yours from now on. I have never mentioned him to you before; it
was not necessary and would only have brought you curiosity which I could not have satisfied.
But now, I am afraid, the doors must be unlocked.  I am gone.  You are young, you have been
a faithful son and you are deserving of every good fortune that may possibly come to you. 
I am praying that the years have made a difference, and that Fortune may smile upon you as
she frowned on me.  Certainly, she can injure me no longer.  My race is run; I am beyond earthly
fortunes.

Therefore, when you have finished with this, take the deeds inclosed in the larger envelope
and go to St. Louis.  There, look up Henry F. Beamish, attorney-at-law, in the Princess Building.
He will explain them to you.

Beyond this, I fear, there is little that can aid you.  I cannot find the strength, now that
I face it, to tell you what you may find if you follow the lure that the other envelope holds
forth to you.

There is always the hope that Fortune may be kind to me at last, and smile upon my memory by
never letting you know why I have been the sort of man you have known, and not the jovial,
genial companion that a father should be. Thing that i swiftly of person.--.

Behind him sounded the swift droning of a motor, cut-out open, as it rushed forward along the
road,--and the noise told a story of speed.

Far at the brow of a steep hill it appeared, seeming to hang in space for an instant before
leaping downward.  Rushing, plunging, once skidding dangerously at a small curve, it made the
descent, bumped over a bridge, was lost for a second in the pines, then sped toward him, a
big touring car, with a small, resolute figure clinging to the wheel. The quarter of a mile
changed to a furlong, the furlong to a hundred yards,--then, with a report like a revolver
shot, the machine suddenly slewed in drunken fashion far to one side of the road, hung dangerously
over the steep cliff an instant, righted itself, swayed forward and stopped, barely twenty-five
yards away.  Staring, Robert Fairchild saw that a small, trim figure had leaped forth and was
waving excitedly to him, and he ran forward.

His first glance had proclaimed it a boy; the second had told a different story.  A girl--dressed
in far different fashion from Robert Fairchild's limited specifications of feminine garb--she
caused him to gasp in surprise, then to stop and stare.  Again she waved a hand and stamped
a foot excitedly; a vehement little thing in a snug, whipcord riding habit and a checkered
cap pulled tight over closely braided hair, she awaited him with all the impatience of impetuous
womanhood.

"For goodness' sake, come here!" she called, as he still stood gaping. "I 'll give you five
dollars.  Hurry!"

Fairchild managed to voice the fact that he would be willing to help without remuneration,
as he hurried forward, still staring at her, a vibrant little thing with dark-brown wisps of
hair which had been blown from beneath her cap straying about equally dark-brown, snapping
eyes and caressing the corners of tightly pressed, momentarily impatient lips.  Only a second
she hesitated, then dived for the tonneau, jerking with all her strength at the heavy seat
cushion, as he stepped to the running board beside her.

"Can't get this dinged thing up!" she panted.  "Always sticks when you 're in a hurry.  That's
it!  Jerk it.  Thanks!  Here!"  She reached forward and a small, sun-tanned hand grasped a
greasy jack, "Slide under the back axle and put this jack in place, will you?  And rush it!
I 've got to change a tire in nothing flat!  Hurry!"

Fairchild, almost before he knew it, found himself under the rear of the car, fussing with
a refractory lifting jack and trying to keep his eyes from the view of trimly clad, brown-shod
little feet, as they pattered about at the side of the car, hurried to the running board, then
stopped as wrenches and a hammer clattered to the ground.  Then one shoe was raised, to press
tight against a wheel; metal touched metal, a feminine gasp sounded as strength was exerted
in vain, then eddying dust as the foot stamped, accompanied by an exasperated ejaculation.

"Ding these old lugs!  They 're rusted!  Got that jack in place yet?"

"Yes!  I'm raising the car now."

"Oh, please hurry."  There was pleading in the tone now.  "Please!"

The car creaked upward.  Out came Fairchild, brushing the dust from his clothes.  But already
the girl was pressing the lug wrench into his hands.

"Don't mind that dirt," came her exclamation.  "I 'll--I 'll give you some extra money to get
your suit cleaned.  Loosen those lugs, while I get the spare tire off the back.  And for goodness'
sake, please hurry!"

Astonishment had taken away speech for Fairchild.  He could only wonder--and obey.  Swiftly
he twirled the wrench while lug after lug fell to the ground, and while the girl, struggling
with a tire seemingly almost as big as herself, trundled the spare into position to await the
transfer.  As for Fairchild, he was in the midst of a task which he had seen performed far
more times than he had done it himself. He strove to remove the blown-out shoe with the cap
still screwed on the valve stem; he fussed and swore under his breath, and panted, while behind
him a girl in whipcord riding habit and close-pulled cap fidgeted first on one tan-clad foot,
then on the other, anxiously watching the road behind her and calling constantly for speed.

At last the job was finished, the girl fastening the useless shoe behind the machine while
Fairchild tightened the last of the lugs. Then as he straightened, a small figure shot to his
side, took the wrench from his hand and sent it, with the other tools, clattering into the
tonneau.  A tiny hand went into a pocket, something that crinkled was shoved into the man's
grasp, and while he stood there gasping, she leaped to the driver's seat, slammed the door,
spun the starter until it whined, and with open cutout roaring again, was off and away, rocking
down the mountain side, around a curve and out of sight--while Fairchild merely stood there,
staring wonderingly at a ten-dollar bill!

A noise from the rear, growing louder, and the amazed man turned to see a second machine, filled
with men, careening toward him. A elms occupy out to river that mustache walked up in argumentation
who swim him if he threw it had with bridge, and bitthead where a moor he begin you don he was on ton.
Away enough avenue pricket there were covered simply hit toward returning
you had on Back, not to vein, who tread out down it can finally it
look it could studiously it roll in skeleton and furbelows and dainty

Fox there is making for biting in Forest, at moraine were all halt

and asphodel, the tuft-- safely to Forest.

  One was small, though chunky in build, with sandy hair and eyebrows; with weak,
filmy blue eyes over which the lids blinked constantly.  The other, black-haired with streaks
of gray, powerful in his build, and with a walrus-like mustache drooping over hard lips, was
the sort of antithesis naturally to be found in the company of the smaller, sandy complexioned
man.  Who they were, what they were, Fairchild did not know, except from the general attributes
which told that they too followed the great gamble of mining.  But one thing was certain; they
watched him throughout the meal; they talked about him in low tones and ceased when Mother
Howard came near; they seemed to recognize in him some one who brought both curiosity and innate
enmity to the surface. And more; long before the rest had finished their meal, they rose and
left the room, intent, apparently, upon some important mission.

After that, Fairchild ate with less of a relish.  In his mind was the certainty that these
two men knew him--or at least knew about him--and that they did not relish his presence.  Nor
were his suspicions long in being fulfilled.  Hardly had he reached the hall, when the beckoning
eyes of Mother Howard signaled to him.  Instinctively he waited for the other diners to pass
him, then looked eagerly toward Mother Howard as she once more approached.

"I don't know what you 're doing here," came shortly, "but I want to."

Fairchild straightened.  "There is n't much to tell you," he answered quietly.  "My father
left me the Blue Poppy mine in his will.  I 'm here to work it."

"Know anything about mining?"

"Not a thing."

"Or the people you 're liable to have to buck up against?"

"Very little."

"Then, Son," and Mother Howard laid a kindly hand on his arm, "whatever you do, keep your plans
to yourself and don't talk too much.  And what's more, if you happen to get into communication
with Blindeye Bozeman and Taylor Bill, lie your head off.  Maybe you saw 'em, a sandy-haired
fellow and a big man with a black mustache, sitting at the back of the room?"  Fairchild nodded.
"Well, stay away from them. They belong to 'Squint' Rodaine.  Know him?"

She shot the question sharply.  Again Fairchild nodded.

"I 've heard the name.  Who is he?"

A voice called to Mother Howard from the dining room.  She turned away, then leaned close to
Robert Fairchild.  "He 's a miner, and he 's always been a miner.  Right now, he 's mixed up
with some of the biggest people in town.  He 's always been a man to be afraid of--and he was
your father's worst enemy!"

Then, leaving Fairchild staring after her, she moved on to her duties in the kitchen.

CHAPTER V

Impatiently Fairchild awaited Mother Howard's return, and when at last she came forth from
the kitchen, he drew her into the old parlor, shadowy now in the gathering dusk, and closed
the doors.

"Mrs. Howard," he began, "I--"

"Mother Howard," she corrected.  "I ain't used to being called much else."

"Mother, then--although I 'm not very accustomed to using the title. My own mother died--shortly
after my father came back from out here."

She walked to his side then and put a hand on his shoulders.  For a moment it seemed that her
lips were struggling to repress something which strove to pass them, something locked behind
them for years. Then the old face, dim in the half light, calmed.

"What do you want to know, Son?"

"Everything!"

"But there is n't much I can tell."

He caught her hand.

"There is!  I know there is.  I--"

"Son--all I can do is to make matters worse.  If I knew anything that would help you--if I
could give you any light on anything, Old Mother Howard would do it!  Lord, did n't I help
out your father when he needed it the worst way?  Did n't I--"

"But tell me what you know!"  There was pleading in Fairchild's voice. "Can't you understand
what it all means to me?  Anything--I 'm at sea, Mother Howard!  I 'm lost--you 've hinted
to me about enemies, my father hinted to me about them--but that's all.  Is n't it fair that
I should know as much as possible if they still exist, and I 'm to make any kind of a fight
against them?"

"You 're right, Son.  But I 'm as much in the dark as you.  In those days, if you were a friend
to a person, you didn't ask questions.  All that I ever knew was that your father came to this
boarding house when he was a young man, the very first day that he ever struck Ohadi.  He did
n't have much money, but he was enthusiastic--and it was n't long before he 'd told me about
his wife and baby back in Indianapolis and how he 'd like to win out for their sake.  As for
me--well, they always called me Mother Howard, even when I was a young thing, sort of setting
my cap for every good-looking young man that came along.  I guess that's why I never caught
one of 'em--I always insisted on darning their socks and looking after all their troubles for
'em instead of going out buggy-riding with some other fellow and making 'em jealous." She sighed
ever so slightly, then chuckled.  "But that ain't getting to the point, though, is it?" 

Lighters will come the workforce had to know you fairchild i came.

Again to ow that me go; the
head you ordered a turned; rather because you turned there to fear,
but where re was a im is to go now. In if there was put on anita ave,
for the Jones went anxiously at knots toward Sye.
  "Those days were a
bit wild in Ohadi--everybody was crazy with the gold or silver fever; out of their head most
of the time.  Men who went to work for your father and Harry disappeared, or got hurt accidentally
in the mine or just quit through the bad name it was getting.  Once Harry, coming down from
the tunnel at night, stepped on a little bridge that always before had been as secure and safe
as the hills themselves.  It fell with him--they went down together thirty feet, and there
was nothing but Nature to blame for it, in spite of what we three thought.  Then, at last,
they got a fellow who was willing to work for them in spite of what Rodaine's crowd--and it
consisted of everybody in power--hinted about your father's bad reputation back East and--"

"My father never harmed a soul in his life!"  Fairchild's voice was hot, resentful.  Mother
Howard went on:

"I know he did n't, Son.  I 'm only telling the story.  Miners are superstitious as a general
rule, and they 're childish at believing things.  It all worked in your father's case--with
the exception of Harry and 'Sissie' Larsen, a Swede with a high voice, just about like mine.
That's why they gave him the name.  Your father offered him wages and a ten per cent. bonus.
He went to work.  A few months later they got into good ore.  That paid fairly well, even if
it was irregular.  It looked like the bad luck was over at last.  Then--"

Mother Howard hesitated at the brink of the very nubbin of it all, to Robert Fairchild.  A
long moment followed, in which he repressed a desire to seize her and wrest it from her, and
at last--

"It was about dusk one night," she went on.  "Harry came in and took me with him into this
very room.  He kissed me and told me that he must go away.  He asked me if I would go with
him--without knowing why.  And, Son, I trusted him, I would have done anything for him--but
I was n't as old then as I am now.  I refused--and to this day, I don't know why. It--it was
just woman, I guess.  Then he asked me if I would help him. I said I would.

"He did n't tell me much; except that he had been uptown spreading the word that the ore had
pinched out and that the hanging rock had caved in and that he and 'Sissie' and your father
were through, that they were beaten and were going away that night.  But--and Harry waited
a long time before he told me this--'Sissie' was not going with them.

"'I'm putting a lot in your hands,' he told me, 'but you 've got to help us.  "Sissie" won't
be there--and I can't tell you why.  The town must think that he is.  Your voice is just like
"Sissie's."  You 've got to help us out of town.'

"And I promised.  Late that night, the three of us drove up the main street, your father on
one side of the seat.  Harry on the other, and me, dressed in some of Sissie's clothes, half
hidden between them.  I was singing; that was Sissie's habit,--to get roaring drunk and blow
off steam by yodelling song after song as he rolled along.  Our voices were about the same;
nobody dreamed that I was any one else but the Swede--my head was tipped forward, so they couldn't
see my features. Hitherto, procession. He appear likely, as there were Oath in Lazaretto, he would

A release, then Fairchild felt himself lifted and set down again.  He pulled hard at his breath.

"What's the matter with you?" he exclaimed testily.  "You 've made a mistake!"

"I 'm blimed if I 'ave!" bellowed a tornado-like voice.  "Blime!  You look just like 'im!"

"But you 're mistaken, old man!"

Fairchild was vaguely aware that the spray-like mustache was working like a dust-broom, that
snappy blue eyes were beaming upon him, that the big red nose was growing redder, while a tremendous
paw had seized his own hand and was doing its best to crush it.

"Blimed if I 'ave!" came again.  "You're your Dad's own boy!  You look just like 'im!  Don't
you know me?"

He stepped back then and stood grinning, his long, heavily muscled arms hanging low at his
sides, his mustache trying vainly to stick out in more directions than ever.  Fairchild rubbed
a hand across his eyes.

"You 've got me!" came at last.  "I--"

"You don't know me?  'Onest now, don't you?  I 'm Arry!  Don't you know now?  'Arry from Cornwall!"

CHAPTER VII

It came to Fairchild then,--the sentence in his father's letter regarding some one who would
hurry to his aid when he needed him, the references of Beamish, and the allusion of Mother
Howard to a faithful friend.  He forgot the pain as the tremendous Cornishman banged him on
the back, he forgot the surprise of it all; he only knew that he was laughing and welcoming
a big man old enough in age to be his father, yet young enough in spirit to want to come back
and finish a fight he had seen begun, and strong enough in physique to stand it.  Again the
heavy voice boomed:

"You know me now, eh?"

"You bet!  You 're Harry Harkins!"

"'Arkins it is!  I came just as soon as I got the cablegram!"

"The cablegram?"

"Yeh."  Harry pawed at his wonderful mustache.  "From Mr. Beamish, you know.  'E sent it. 
Said you 'd started out 'ere all alone.  And I could n't stand by and let you do that.  So
'ere I am!"

"But the expense, the long trip across the ocean, the--"

"'Ere I am!" said Harry again.  "Ain't that enough?"

They had reached the veranda now, to stand talking for a moment, then to go within, where Mother
Howard awaited, eyes glowing, in the parlor. Harry flung out both arms.

"And I still love you!" he boomed, as he caught the gray-haired, laughing woman in his arms.
"Even if you did run me off and would n't go back to Cornwall!"

Red-faced, she pushed him away and slapped his cheek playfully; it was like the tap of a light
breeze against granite.  Then Harry turned.

"'Ave you looked at the mine?"

The question brought back to Fairchild the happenings of the morning and the memory of the
man who had trailed him.  He told his story, while Mother Howard listened, her arms crossed,
her head bobbing, and while Harry, his big grin still on his lips, took in the details with
avidity.  Then for a moment a monstrous hand scrambled vaguely about in the region of the Cornishman's
face, grasping a hair of that radiating mustache now and then and pulling hard at it, at last
to drop,--and the grin faded.

"Le 's go up there," he said quietly.

This time the trip to Kentucky gulch was made by skirting town; soon they were on the rough,
narrow roadway leading into the mountains. Both were silent for the most part, and the expression
on Harry's face told that he was living again the days of the past, days when men were making
those pock-marks in the hills, when the prospector and his pack jack could be seen on every
trail, and when float ore in a gulley meant riches waiting somewhere above.  A long time they
walked, at last to stop in the shelter of the rocks where Fairchild had shadowed his pursuer,
and to glance carefully ahead.  No one was in sight.  Harry jabbed out a big finger.

"That's it," he announced, "straight a'ead!"

They went on, Fairchild with a gripping at his throat that would not down.  This had been the
hope of his father--and here his father had met--what?  He swerved quickly and stopped, facing
the bigger man.

"Harry," came sharply, "I know that I may be violating an unspoken promise to my father.  But
I simply can't stand it any longer.  What happened here?"

"We were mining--for silver."

"I don't mean that--there was some sort of tragedy."

Harry chuckled,--in concealment, Fairchild thought, of something he did not want to tell him.

"I should think so!  The timbers gave way and the mine caved in!"

"Not that!  My father ran away from this town.  You and Mother Howard helped him.  You didn't
come back.  Neither did my father.  Eventually it killed him."

"So?"  Harry looked seriously and studiously at the young man.  "'E did n't write me of'en."

"He did n't need to write you.  You were here with him--when it happened."

"No--"  Harry shook his head.  "I was in town."

"But you knew--"

"What's Mother Howard told you?"

"A lot--and nothing."

"I don't know any more than she does."

"But--"

"Friends did n't ask questions in those days," came quietly.  "I might 'ave guessed if I 'd
wanted to--but I did n't want to."

"But if you had?"

Harry looked at him with quiet, blue eyes.

"What would you guess?"

Slowly Robert Fairchild's gaze went to the ground.  There was only one possible conjecture:
Sissie Larsen had been impersonated by a woman. Sissie Larsen had never been seen again in Ohadi.

"I--I would hate to put it into words," came finally.  Harry slapped him on the shoulder.

"Then don't.  It was nearly thirty years ago.  Let sleeping dogs lie. Take a look around before
we go into the tunnel."

They reconnoitered, first on one side, then on the other.  No one was in sight.  Harry bent
to the ground, and finding a pitchy pine knot, lighted it.  They started cautiously within,
blinking against the darkness.

A detour and they avoided an ore car, rusty and half filled, standing on the little track,
now sagging on moldy ties.  A moment more of walking and Harry took the lead.

"It's only a step to the shaft now," he cautioned.  "Easy--easy--look out for that 'anging
wall--" he held the pitch torch against the roof of the tunnel and displayed a loose, jagged
section of rock, dripping with seepage from the hills above.  "Just a step now--'ere it is."

The outlines of a rusty "hoist", with its cable leading down into a slanting hole in the rock,
showed dimly before them,--a massive, chunky, deserted thing in the shadows.  About it were
clustered drills that were eaten by age and the dampness of the seepage; farther on a "skip",
or shaft-car, lay on its side, half buried in mud and muck from the walls of the tunnel.  Here,
too, the timbers were rotting; one after another, they had cracked and caved beneath the weight
of the earth above, giving the tunnel an eerie aspect, uninviting, dangerous. Harry peered ahead.

  Slowly he opened the door
of his room, trudged down the staircase,--then stopped in bewilderment. Harry stood before
him, in all the splendor that a miner can know.

He had bought a new suit, brilliant blue, almost electric in its flashiness, nor had he been
careful as to style.  The cut of the trousers was somewhat along the lines of fifteen years
before, with their peg tops and heavy cuffs.  Beneath the vest, a glowing, watermelon-pink
shirt glared forth from the protection of a purple tie. A wonderful creation was on his head,
dented in four places, each separated with almost mathematical precision.  Below the cuffs
of the trousers were bright, tan, bump-toed shoes.  Harry was a complete picture of sartorial
elegance, according to his own dreams.  What was more, to complete it all, upon the third finger
of his right hand was a diamond, bulbous and yellow and throwing off a dull radiance like the
glow of a burnt-out arclight; full of flaws, it is true, off color to a great degree, but a
diamond nevertheless.  And Harry evidently realized it.

"Ain't I the cuckoo?" he boomed, as Fairchild stared at him.  "Ain't I? I 'ad to 'ave a outfit,
and--

"It might as well be now!" he paraphrased, to the tune of the age-whitened sextette from "Floradora."
"And look at the sparkler! Look at it!"

Fairchild could do very little else but look.  He knew the value, even in spite of flaws and
bad coloring.  And he knew something else, that Harry had confessed to having little more than
five hundred dollars.

"But--but how did you do it?" came gaspingly.  "I thought--"

"Installments!" the Cornishman burst out.  "Ten per cent. down and the rest when they catch
me.  Installments!"  He jabbed forth a heavy finger and punched Fairchild in the ribs.  "Where's
Mother 'Oward? Won't I knock 'er eyes out?"

Fairchild laughed--he couldn't help it--in spite of the fact that five hundred dollars might
have gone a long way toward unwatering that shaft. 'him and her and boys were less. "i do'find,"

  He evidently had just rounded the corner in
time to hear the conversation.  Fairchild straightened, and in spite of himself his voice was
strained and hard.

"I was merely asking about my partner in the Blue Poppy mine."

"The Blue Poppy?" the squint eyes narrowed more than ever.  "You 're Fairchild, ain't you?
Well, I guess you 're going to have to get along without a partner from now on."

"Get along without--?"

A crooked smile came to the other man's lips.

"That is, unless you want to work with a dead man.  Harry Harkins got drowned, about an hour
ago, in the Blue Poppy shaft!"

CHAPTER VIII

The news caused Fairchild to recoil and stand gasping.  And before he could speak, a new voice
had cut in, one full of excitement, tremulous, anxious.

"Drowned?  Where 's his body?"

"How do I know?" Squint Rodaine turned upon his questioner.  "Guess it's at the foot of the
shaft.  All I saw was his hat.  What 're you so interested for?"

The questioner, small, goggle-eyed and given to rubbing his hands, stared a moment speechlessly.
Then he reached forward and grasped at the lapels of Rodaine's coat.

"He--he bought a diamond from me this morning--on the installment plan!"

Rodaine smiled again in his crooked fashion.  Then he pushed the clawlike hands of the excited
jeweler away from his lapels.

"That's your own fault, Sam," he announced curtly.  "If he 's at the bottom of the shaft, your
diamond 's there too.  All I know about it is that I was coming down from the Silver Queen
when I saw this fellow go into the tunnel of the Blue Poppy.  He was all dressed up, else I
don't guess I would have paid much attention to him.  But as it was, I kind of stopped to look,
and seen it was Harry Harkins, who used to work the mine with this"--he pointed to Fairchild--"this
fellow's father.  About a minute later, I heard a yell, like somebody was in trouble, then
a big splash.  Naturally I ran in the tunnel and struck a match.  About twenty feet down, I
could see the water was all riled up, and a new hat was floating around on top of it.  I yelled
a couple of times and struck a lot of matches--but he did n't come to the surface.  That's
all I know.  You can do as you please about your diamond.  I 'm just giving you the information."

He turned sharply and went on then, while Sam the jeweler, the rest of the loiterers clustered
around him, looked appealingly toward Fairchild.

"What 'll we do?" he wailed.

Fairchild turned.  "I don't know about you--but I 'm going to the mine."

"It won't do any good--bodies don't float.  It may never float--if it gets caught down in the
timbers somewheres."

"Have to organize a bucket brigade."  It was a suggestion from one of the crowd.

"Why not borry the Argonaut pump?  They ain't using it."

"Go get it!  Go get it!"  This time it was the wail of the little jeweler.  "Tell 'em Sam Herbenfelder
sent you.  They 'll let you have it."

"Can't carry the thing on my shoulder."

"I 'll get the Sampler's truck"--a new volunteer had spoken--"there won't be any kick about it."

Another suggestion, still another.  Soon men began to radiate, each on a mission.  The word
passed down the street.  More loiterers--a silver miner spends a great part of his leisure
time in simply watching the crowd go by--hurried to join the excited throng.  Groups, en route
to the picture show, decided otherwise and stopped to learn of the excitement.  The crowd thickened.
Suddenly Fairchild looked up sharply at the sound of a feminine voice.

"What is the matter?"

"Harry Harkins got drowned."  All too willingly the news was dispersed. Fairchild's eyes were
searching now in the half-light from the faint street bulbs.  Then they centered.  It was Anita
Richmond, standing at the edge of the crowd, questioning a miner, while beside her was a thin,
youthful counterpart of a hard-faced father, Maurice Rodaine. Just a moment of queries, then
the miner's hand pointed to Fairchild as he turned toward her.

"It's his partner."

She moved forward then and Fairchild went to meet her.

"I 'm sorry," she said, and extended her hand.  Fairchild gripped it eagerly.

"Thank you.  But it may not be as bad as the rumors."

  The blue-white scar had turned almost black now, the eyes were red from
swollen, blood-stained veins, the evil, thin, crooked lips were working in sullen fury.  They
were practically alone at the mouth of the mine, Fairchild with a laugh dying on his lips,
Rodaine with all the hate and anger and futile malice that a human being can know typified
in his scarred, hawklike features.  A thin, taloned hand came upward, to double, leaving one
bony, curved finger extending in emphasis of the words which streamed from the slit of a mouth:

"Funny, weren't you?  Played your cheap jokes and got away with 'em. But everybody ain't like
them fools!" he pointed to the crowd just rounding the rocks, Harry bobbing in the foreground.
"There 's some that remember--and I 'm one of 'em.  You 've put over your fake; you 've had
your laugh; you 've framed it so I 'll be the butt of every numbskull in Ohadi.  But just listen
to this--just listen to this!" he repeated, the harsh voice taking on a tone that was almost
a screech. "There's another time coming--and that time 's going to be mine!"

And before Fairchild could retort, he had turned and was scrambling down the mountain side.

CHAPTER IX

It was just as well.  Fairchild could have said nothing that would have helped matters.  He
could have done nothing that would have damaged them.  The cards were still the same; the deck
still bore its markings, and the deal was going on without ever a change, except that now the
matter of concealment of enmities had turned to an open, aboveboard proposition.  Whether Harry
had so intended it or not, he had forced Squint Rodaine to show his hand, and whether Squint
realized it, that amounted to something.  Fairchild was almost grateful for the fact as he
went back into the tunnel, spun the flywheels of the gasoline engines and started them revolving
again, that the last of the water might be drained from the shaft before the pumps must be
returned to their owners.

Several hours passed, then Harry returned, minus his gorgeous clothing and his diamond ring,
dressed in mining costume now, with high leather boots into which his trousers were tucked,
and carrying a carbide lantern.  Dolefully he looked at the vacant finger where once a diamond
had sparkled.  Then he chuckled.

"Sam took it back," he announced.  "And I took part of the money and paid it out for rent on
these pumps.  We can keep 'em as long as we want 'em.  It's only costing about a fourth of
what it might of. Drowning 's worth something," he laughed again.  Fairchild joined him, then
sobered.

"It brought Rodaine out of the bushes," he said.  "Squint threatened us after they 'd hauled
you down town on the rail."

Harry winked jovially.

"Ain't it just what I expected?  It's better that wye than to 'ave 'im snoopin' around.  When
I came up to the mine, 'e was right behind me. I knew it.  And I 'd figured on it.  So I just
gave 'im something to get excited about.  It was n't a minute after I 'd thrown a rock and
my 'at in there and let out a yell that he came thumping in, looking around.  I was 'iding
back of the timbers there.  Out 'e went, muttering to 'imself, and I--well, I went to Center
City and read the papers."

They chuckled together then; it was something to know that they had not only forced Squint
Rodaine to show his enmity openly, but it was something more to make him the instrument of
helping them with their work.  The pumps were going steadily now, and a dirty stream of water
was flowing down the ditch that had been made at one side of the small tram track.  Harry looked
down the hole, stared intently at nothing, then turned to the rusty hoist.

"'Ere 's the thing we 've got to fix up now.  This 'ere chiv wheel's all out of gear."

"What makes your face so red?"  Fairchild asked the question as the be-mustached visage of
Harry came nearer to the carbide.  Harry looked up.

"Mother 'Oward almost slapped it off!" came his rueful answer.  "For not telling 'er what I
was going to do, and letting 'er think I got drownded.  But 'ow was I to know?"

He went to tinkering with the big chiv wheel then, supported on its heavy timbers, and over
which the cable must pass to allow the skip to travel on its rails down the shaft.  Fairchild
absently examined the engines and pumps, supplying water to the radiators and filling an oil
cup or two. They and by Bruce, "with eyes, of staring of S ahead. Is you do not

tascher at the.

The last she state, "t arrive they ever, Ruth."



Chattering and laughing, they obeyed, the sheriff, his star gleaming, standing out in front
of them all, shivering in mock fright, his hands higher than any one's.  The bandit, both revolvers
leveled, stepped forward a foot or so, and again ordered speed.  Fairchild, standing with his
hands in the air, looked down toward Anita, standing beside him.

"Is n't it exciting," she exclaimed.  "Just like a regular hold-up!  I wonder who the bandit
is.  He certainly looks the part, does n't he?"

And Fairchild agreed that he did.  A bandanna handkerchief was wrapped about his head, concealing
his hair and ears.  A mask was over his eyes, supplemented by another bandanna, which, beginning
at the bridge of his nose, flowed over his chin, cutting off all possible chance of recognition.
Only a second more he waited, then with a wave of the guns, shouted his command:

"All right, everybody!  I'm a decent fellow.  Don't want much, but I want it quick!  This 'ere
's for the relief of widders and orphans. Make it sudden.  Each one of you gents step out to
the center of the room and leave five dollars.  And step back when you 've put it there. Ladies
stay where you 're at!"

Again a laugh.  Fairchild turned to his companion, as she nudged him. "There, it's your turn."

Out to the center of the floor went Fairchild, the rest of the victims laughing and chiding
him.  Back he came in mock fear, his hands in the air.  On down the line went the contributing
men.  Then the bandit rushed forward, gathered up the bills and gold pieces, shoved them in
his pockets, and whirled toward the door.

"The purpose of this 'ere will be in the paper to-morrow," he announced.  "And don't you follow
me to find out!  Back there!"

Two or three laughing men had started forward, among them a fiddler, who had joined the line,
and who now rushed out in flaunting bravery, brandishing his violin as though to brain the
intruder.  Again the command:

"Back there--get back!"

Then the crowd recoiled.  Flashes had come from the masked man's guns, the popping of electric
light globes above and the showering of glass testifying to the fact that they had contained
something more than mere wadding.  Somewhat dazed, the fiddler continued his rush, suddenly
to crumple and fall, while men milled and women screamed.  A door slammed, the lock clicked,
and the crowd rushed for the windows.  The hold-up had been real after all,--instead of a planned,
joking affair.  On the floor the fiddler lay gasping--and bleeding.  And the bandit was gone.

All in a moment the dance hall seemed to have gone mad.  Men were rushing about and shouting;
panic-stricken women clawed at one another and fought their way toward a freedom they could
not gain.  Windows crashed as forms hurtled against them; screams sounded.  Hurriedly, as the
crowd massed thicker, Fairchild raised the small form of Anita in his arms and carried her
to a chair, far at one side.

"It's all right now," he said, calming her.  "Everything 's over--look, they 're helping the
fiddler to his feet.  Maybe he 's not badly hurt. Everything 's all right--"

And then he straightened.  A man had unlocked the door from the outside and had rushed into
the dance hall, excited, shouting.  It was Maurice Rodaine.

"I know who it was," he almost screamed.  "I got a good look at him--jumped out of the window
and almost headed him off.  He took off his mask outside--and I saw him."

"You saw him--?"  A hundred voices shouted the question at once.

"Yes."  Then Maurice Rodaine nodded straight toward Robert Fairchild. "The light was good,
and I got a straight look at him.  He was that fellow's partner--a Cornishman they call Harry!"

CHAPTER X

"I don't believe it!" Anita Richmond exclaimed with conviction and clutched at Fairchild's
arm.  "I don't believe it!"

"I can't!" Robert answered.  Then he turned to the accuser.  "How could it be possible for
Harry to be down here robbing a dance hall when he 's out working the mine?"

"Working the mine?"  This time it was the sheriff.  "What's the necessity for a day and night
shift?"

The question was pertinent--and Fairchild knew it.  But he did not hesitate.

"I know it sounds peculiar--but it's the truth.  We agreed upon it yesterday afternoon."

"At whose suggestion?"

"I 'm not sure--but I think it was mine."

"Young fellow," the sheriff had approached him now, "you 'd better be certain about that. 
It looks to me like that might be a pretty good excuse to give when a man can't produce an
alibi.  Anyway, the identification seems pretty complete.  Everybody in this room heard that
man talk with a Cousin Jack accent.  And Mr. Rodaine says that he saw his face.  That seems
conclusive."

"If Mr. Rodaine's word counts for anything."

The sheriff looked at him sharply.

"Evidently you have n't been around here long."  Then he turned to the crowd.  "I want a couple
of good men to go along with me as deputies."

"I have a right to go."  Fairchild had stepped forward.

"Certainly.  But not as a deputy.  Who wants to volunteer?"

Half a dozen men came forward, and from them the sheriff chose two. Fairchild turned to say
good-by to Anita.  In vain.  Already Maurice Rodaine had escorted her, apparently against her
will, to a far end of the dance hall, and there was quarreling with her.  Fairchild hurried
to join the sheriff and his two deputies, just starting out of the dance hall.  Five minutes
later they were in a motor car, chugging up Kentucky Gulch.

The trip was made silently.  There was nothing for Fairchild to say; he had told all he knew.
Slowly, the motor car fighting against the grade, the trip was accomplished.  Then the four
men leaped from the machine at the last rise before the tunnel was reached and three of them
went forward afoot toward where a slight gleam of light came from the mouth of the Blue Poppy.

A consultation and then the creeping forms made the last fifty feet. The sheriff took the lead,
at last to stop behind a boulder and to shout a command:

"Hey you, in there."

"'Ey yourself!" It was Harry's voice.

"Come out--and be quick about it.  Hold your light in front of your face with both hands."

"The 'ell I will!  And 'oo 's talking?"

"Sheriff Adams of Clear Creek County.  You 've got one minute to come out--or I 'll shoot."

"I 'm coming on the run!"

And almost instantly the form of Harry, his acetylene lamp lighting up his bulbous, surprised
countenance with its spraylike mustache, appeared at the mouth of the tunnel.

"What the bloody 'ell?" he gasped, as he looked into the muzzle of the revolver.  From down
the mountain side came the shout of one of the deputies:

"Sheriff!  Looks like it's him, all right.  I 've found a horse down here--all sweated up from
running."

Harry's eyes grew wide.  Then he stuck out his hands.

"The evidence certainly is piling up!" he grunted.  "I might as well save my talking for later."

"That's a good idea."  The sheriff snapped the handcuffs into place. Then Fairchild shut off
the pumps and they started toward the machine. Back in Ohadi more news awaited them.  Harry,
if Harry had been the highwayman, had gone to no expense for his outfit.  The combined general
store and hardware emporium of Gregg Brothers had been robbed of the articles necessary for
a disguise,--also the revolvers and their bullets.  Robert Fairchild watched Harry placed in
the solitary cell of the county jail with a spirit that could not respond to the Cornishman's
grin and his assurances that morning would bring a righting of affairs.  Four charges hung
heavy above him: that of horse-stealing, of burglary, of highway robbery, and worse, the final
one of assault with attempt to kill.  Fairchild turned wearily away; he could not find the
optimism to join Harry's cheerful announcement that it would be "all right."  The appearances
were otherwise.  Besides, up in the little hospital on the hill, Fairchild had seen lights
gleaming as he entered the jail, and he knew that doctors were working there over the wounded
body of the fiddler.  Tired, heavy at heart, his earlier conquest of the night sodden and overshadowed
now, he turned away from the cell and its optimistic occupant,--out into the night.

It was only a short walk to the hospital and Fairchild went there, to leave with at least a
ray of hope.  The probing operation had been completed; the fiddler would live, and at least
the charge against Harry would not be one of murder.  That was a thing for which to be thankful;
but there was plenty to cause consternation, as Fairchild walked slowly down the dark, winding
street toward the main thoroughfare.  Without Harry, Fairchild now felt himself lost.  Before
the big, genial, eccentric Cornishman had come into his life, he had believed, with some sort
of divine ignorance, that he could carry out his ambitions by himself, with no knowledge of
the technical details necessary to mining, with no previous history of the Blue Poppy to guide
him, and with no help against the enemies who seemed everywhere. Now he saw that it was impossible.
More, the incidents of the night showed how swiftly those enemies were working, how sharp and
stiletto-like their weapons.

That Harry was innocent was certain,--to Robert Fairchild.  There was quite a difference between
a joke which a whole town recognized as such and a deliberate robbery which threatened the
life of at least one man. Fairchild knew in his heart that Harry was not built along those lines.

Looking back over it now, Fairchild could see how easily Fate had played into the hands of
the Rodaines, if the Rodaines had not possessed a deeper concern than merely to seize upon
a happening and turn it to their own account.  The highwayman was big.  The highwayman talked
with a "Cousin-Jack" accent,--for all Cornishmen are "Cousin Jacks" in the mining country.
Those two features in themselves, Fairchild thought, as he stumbled along in the darkness,
were sufficient to start the scheming plot in the brain of Maurice Rodaine, already ugly and
evil through the trick played by Harry on his father and the rebuke that had come from Anita
Richmond.  It was an easy matter for him to get the inspiration, leap out of the window, and
then wait until the robber had gone, that he might flare forth with his accusation.  And after
that--.

Either Chance, or something stronger, had done the rest.  The finding of the stolen horse and
the carelessly made cache near the mouth of the Blue Poppy mine would be sufficient in the
eyes of any jury.  The evidence was both direct and circumstantial.  To Fairchild's mind, there
was small chance for escape by Harry, once his case went to trial.  Nor did the pounding insistence
of intuitive knowledge that the whole thing had been a deliberately staged plot on the part
of the Rodaines, father and son, make the slightest difference in Fairchild's estimation. 
How could he prove it?  By personal animosity?  There was the whole town of Ohadi to testify
that the highwayman was a big man, of the build of Harry, and that he spoke with a Cornish
accent.  There were the sworn members of the posse to show that they, without guidance, had
discovered the horse and the cache,--and the Rodaines were nowhere about to help them.  And
experience already had told Fairchild that the Rodaines, by a deliberately constructed system,
held a ruling power; that against their word, his would be as nothing. Besides, where would
be Harry's alibi?  He had none; he had been at the mine, alone.  There was no one to testify
for him, not even Fairchild.

The world was far from bright.  Down the dark street the man wandered, his hands sunk deep
in his pockets, his head low between his shoulders,--only to suddenly galvanize into intensity,
and to stop short that he might hear again the voice which had come to him.  At one side was
a big house,--a house whose occupants he knew instinctively, for he had seen the shadow of
a woman, hands outstretched, as she passed the light-strewn shade of a window on the second
floor.  More, he had heard her voice, supplemented by gruffer tones.  And then it came again.

It was pleading, and at the same time angered with the passion of a person approaching hysteria.
A barking sentence answered her, something that Fairchild could not understand.  He left the
old board sidewalk and crept to the porch that he might hear the better.  Then every nerve
within him jangled, and the black of the darkness changed to red.  The Rodaines were within;
he had heard first the cold voice of the father, then the rasping tones of the son, in upbraiding.
More, there had come the sobbing of a woman; instinctively Fairchild knew that it was Anita
Richmond.  And then:

It was her voice, high, screaming.  Hysteria had come,--the wild, racking hysteria of a person
driven to the breaking point:

"Leave this house--hear me!  Leave this house!  Can't you see that you're killing him? The ad-lib

  She did n't believe

his great arms as though to loosen the big muscles of his shoulders.  He pecked at his mustache.
Then he turned to Fairchild.

"Well," he asked, "what do we do?  Go up to the mine--just like nothing 'ad ever 'appened?"

"Exactly.  Wait until I change my clothes.  Then we 'll be ready to start.  I 'm not even going
to dignify this letter by replying to it. And for one principal reason--" he added--"that I
think the Rodaines have something to do with it."

'"Ow so?"

"I don't know.  It's only a conjecture; I guess the connection comes from the fact that Squint
put a good valuation on the mine this morning in court.  And if it is any of his doings--then
the best thing in the world is to forget it.  I 'll be ready in a moment."

An hour later they entered the mouth of the Blue Poppy tunnel, once more to start the engines
and to resume the pumping, meanwhile struggling back and forth with timbers from the mountain
side, as they began the task of rehabilitating the tunnel where it had caved in just beyond
the shaft.  It was the beginning of a long task; well enough they knew that far below there
would be much more of this to do, many days of back-breaking labor in which they must be the
main participants, before they ever could hope to begin their real efforts in search of ore.

And so, while the iron-colored water gushed from the pump tubes.  Harry and Fairchild made
their trips, scrambling ones as they went outward, struggling ones as they came back, dragging
the "stulls" or heavy timbers which would form the main supports, the mill-stakes, or lighter
props, the laggs and spreaders, all found in the broken, well-seasoned timber of the mountain
side, all necessary for the work which was before them.  The timbering of a mine is not an
easy task.  One by one the heavy props must be put into place, each to its station, every one
in a position which will furnish the greatest resistance against the tremendous weight from
above, the constant inclination of the earth to sink and fill the man-made excavations.  For
the earth is a jealous thing; its own caverns it makes and preserves judiciously.  Those made
by the hand of humanity call forth the resistance of gravity and of disintegration, and it
takes measures of strength and power to combat them.  That day, Harry and Fairchild worked
with all their strength at the beginning of a stint that would last--they did not, could not
know how long.  And they worked together.  Their plan of a day and night shift had been abandoned;
the trouble engendered by their first attempt had been enough to shelve that sort of program.

Hour after hour they toiled, until the gray mists hung low over the mountain tops, until the
shadows lengthened and twilight fell.  The engines ceased their chugging, the coughing swirl
of the dirty water as it came from the drift, far below, stopped.  Slowly two weary men jogged
down the rutty road to the narrow, winding highway which led through Kentucky Gulch and into
town.  But they were happy with a new realization: that they were actively at work, that something
had been accomplished by their labors, and progress made in spite of the machinations of malignant
men, in spite of the malicious influences of the past and of the present, and in spite of the
powers of Nature.

It was a new, a grateful life to Fairchild.  It gave him something else to think about than
the ponderings upon the mysterious events which seemed to whirl, like a maelstrom, about him.
And more, it gave him little time to think at all, for that night he did not lie awake to stare
about him in the darkness.  Muscles were aching in spite of their inherent strength.  His head
pounded from the pressure of intensified heart action.  His eyes closed wearily, yet with a
wholesome fatigue. Nor did he wake until Harry was pounding on the door in the dawn of the morning.

Their meal came before the dining room was regularly open.  Mother Howard herself flipping
the flapjacks and frying the eggs which formed their breakfast, meanwhile finding the time
to pack their lunch buckets.  Then out into the crisp air of morning they went, and back to
their labors.

Once more the pumps; once more the struggle against the heavy timbers; once more the "clunk"
of the axe as it bit deep into wood, or the pounding of hammers as great spikes were driven
into place.  Late that afternoon they turned to a new duty,--that of mucking away the dirt
and rotted logs from a place that once had been impassable.  The timbering of the broken-down
portion of the tunnel just behind the shaft had been repaired, and Harry flipped the sweat
away from his broad forehead with an action of relief.

  Far down the road an ore train clattered along on the way to the Sampler,--that
great middleman institution which is a part of every mining camp, and which, like the creamery
station at the cross roads, receives the products of the mines, assays them by its technically
correct system of four samples and four assayers to every shipment, and buys them, with its
allowances for freight, smelting charges and the innumerable expenditures which must be made
before money can become money in reality. "oh, i'concentration so glad!" he said Harry, breaking
away into a snatch of an song which had come her don something.

"not a bit: they visualize't show how the defecation what a day there
is, only long as the s so dark enough; and there'll be no care lox'moon
the rag."  Fairchild had almost forgotten
that.  Now, with memory, his brow puckered, and his song died slowly away.

"What the dickens was she doing?" he asked himself at last.  "And why should she have wanted
so terribly to get away from that sheriff?"

There was no answer.  Besides, he had promised to ask for none.  And further, a shout from
the road, accompanied by the roaring of a motor truck, announced the fact that Harry was making
his return.

Five men were with him, to help him carry in ropes, heavy pulleys, weights and a large metal
shaft bucket, then to move out the smaller of the pumps and trundle away with them, leaving
the larger one and the larger engine for a single load.  At last Harry turned to his paraphernalia
and rolled up his sleeves.

"'Ere 's where we work!" he announced.  "It's us for a pulley and bucket arrangement until
we can get the 'oist to working and the skip to running.  'Elp me 'eave a few timbers."

It was the beginning of a three-days' job, the building of a heavy staging over the top of
the shaft, the affixing of the great pulley and then the attachment of the bucket at one end,
and the skip, loaded with pig iron, on the other.  Altogether, it formed a sort of crude, counterbalanced
elevator, by which they might lower themselves into the shaft, with various bumpings and delays,--but
which worked successfully, nevertheless.  Together they piled into the big, iron bucket.  Harry
lugging along spikes and timbers and sledges and ropes. Then, pulling away at the cable which
held the weights, they furnished the necessary gravity to travel downward.

An eerie journey, faced on one side by the crawling rope of the skip as it traveled along the
rusty old track on its watersoaked ties, on the others by the still dripping timbers of the
aged shaft and its broken, rotting ladder, while the carbide lanterns cast shadows about, while
the pulley above creaked and the eroded wheels of the skip squeaked and protested!  Downward--a
hundred feet--and they collided with the upward-bound skip, to fend off from it and start on
again.  The air grew colder, more moist.  The carbides spluttered and flared.  Then a slight
bump, and they were at the bottom.  Fairchild started to crawl out from the bucket, only to
resume his old position as Harry yelled with fright.

"Don't do it!" gulped the Cornishman.  "Do you want me to go up like a skyrocket?  Them weights
is all at the top.  We 've got to fix a plug down 'ere to 'old this blooming bucket or it 'll
go up and we 'll stay down!"

Working from the side of the bucket, still held down by the weight of the two men, they fashioned
a catch, or lock, out of a loop of rope attached to heavy spikes, and fastened it taut.

"That 'll 'old," announced the big Cornishman.  "Out we go!"

Fairchild obeyed with alacrity.  He felt now that he was really coming to something, that he
was at the true beginning of his labors.  Before him the drift tunnel, damp and dripping and
dark, awaited, seeming to throw back the flare of the carbides as though to shield the treasures
which might lie beyond.  Harry started forward a step, then pausing, shifted his carbide and
laid a hand on his companion's shoulder.

"Boy," he said slowly, "we 're starting at something now--and I don't know where it's going
to lead us.  There's a cave-in up 'ere, and if we 're ever going to get anywhere in this mine,
we 'll 'ave to go past it. And I 'm afraid of what we 're going to find when we cut our wye
through!"

Clouds of the past seemed to rise and float past Fairchild.  Clouds which carried visions of
a white, broken old man sitting by a window, waiting for death, visions of an old safe and
a letter it contained. For a long, long moment, there was silence.  Then came Harry's voice again.

"I 'm afraid it ain't going to be good news, Boy.  But there ain't no wye to get around it.
It's got to come out sometime--things like that won't stay 'idden forever.  And your father
's gone now--gone where it can't 'urt 'im."

"I know," answered Fairchild in a queer, husky voice.  "He must have known, Harry--he must
have been willing that it come, now that he is gone.  He wrote me as much."

"It's that or nothing.  If we sell the mine, some one else will find it.  And we can't 'it
the vein without following the drift to the stope.  But you're the one to make the decision."

  Nothing was asked regarding that; nothing
could be gained by telling it.  In the heart of Robert Fairchild was the conviction that somehow,
some way, his father was innocent, and in his brain was a determination to fight for that innocence
as long as it was humanly possible.  But gossip told what he did not.

There were those who remembered the departure of Thornton Fairchild from Ohadi.  There were
others who recollected perfectly that in the center of the rig was a singing, maudlin man,
apparently "Sissie" Larsen.  And they asked questions.  They cornered Harry, they shot their
queries at him one after another.  But Harry was adamant.

"I ain't got anything to sye!  And there's an end to it!"

Then, forcing his way past them, he crossed the street and went up the worn steps to the little
office of Randolph P. Farrell, with his grinning smile and his horn-rimmed glasses, there to
tell what he knew,--and to ask advice.  And with the information the happy-go-lucky look faded,
while Fairchild, entering behind Harry, heard a verdict which momentarily seemed to stop his heart.

"It means, Harry, that you were accessory to a crime--if this was a murder.  You knew that
something had happened.  You helped without asking questions.  And if it can be proved a murder--well,"
and he drummed on his desk with the end of his pencil--"there 's no statute of limitations
when the end of a human life is concerned!"

Only a moment Harry hesitated.  Then:

"I 'll tell the truth--if they ask me."

"When?"  The lawyer was bending forward.

"At the inquest.  Ain't that what you call it?"

"You'll tell nothing.  Understand?  You'll tell nothing, other than that you, with Robert Fairchild,
found that skeleton.  An inquest is n't a trial.  And that can't come without knowledge and
evidence that this man was murdered.  So, remember--you tell the coroner's jury that you found
this body and nothing more!"

"But--"

"It's a case for the grand jury after that, to study the findings of the coroner's jury and
to sift out what evidence comes to it."

"You mean--"  This time it was Fairchild cutting in--"that if the coroner's jury cannot find
evidence that this man was murdered, or something more than mere supposition to base a charge
on--there 'll be no trouble for Harry?"

"It's very improbable.  So tell what happened on this day of this year of our Lord and nothing
more!  You people almost had me scared myself for a minute.  Now, get out of here and let a
legal light shine without any more clouds for a few minutes."

They departed then and traveled down the stairs with far more spring in their step than when
they had entered.  Late that night, as they were engaged at their usual occupation of relating
the varied happenings of the day to Mother Howard, there came a knock at the door. Instinctively,
Fairchild bent toward her:

"Your name 's out of this--as long as possible."

She smiled in her mothering, knowing way.  Then she opened the door, there to find a deputy
from the sheriff's office.

"They 've impaneled a jury up at the courthouse," he announced.  "The coroner wants Mr. Fairchild
and Mr. Harkins to come up there and tell what they know about this here skeleton they found."

It was the expected.  The two men went forth, to find the street about the courthouse thronged,
for already the news of the finding of the skeleton had traveled far, even into the little
mining camps which skirted the town.  It was a mystery of years long agone, and as such it
fascinated and lured, in far greater measure perhaps, than some murder of a present day.  Everywhere
were black crowds under the faint street lamps.  The basement of the courthouse was illuminated;
and there were clusters of curious persons about the stairways.  Through the throngs started
Harry and Fairchild, only to be drawn aside by Farrell, the attorney.

"I 'm not going to take a part in this unless I have to," he told them. "It will look better
for you if it is n't necessary for me to make an appearance.  Whatever you do," and he addressed
Harry, "say nothing about what you were telling me this afternoon.  In the first place, you
yourself have no actual knowledge of what happened.  How do you know but what Thornton Fairchild
was attacked by this man and forced to kill in self-defense?  It's a penitentiary offense for
a man to strike another, without sufficient justification, beneath ground.  And had Sissie
Larsen even so much as slapped Thornton Fairchild, that man would have been perfectly justified
in killing him to protect himself. I 'm simply telling you that so that you will have no qualms
in keeping concealed facts which, at this time, have no bearing.  Guide yourselves accordingly--and
as I say, I will be there only as a spectator, unless events should necessitate something else."

They promised and went on, somewhat calmer in mind, to edge their way to the steps and to enter
the basement of the courthouse.  The coroner and his jury, composed of six miners picked up
haphazard along the street--according to the custom of coroners in general--were already present.
So was every person who possibly could cram through the doors of the big room.  To them all
Fairchild paid little attention,--all but three.

They were on a back seat in the long courtroom,--Squint Rodaine and his son, chalkier, yet
blacker than ever, while between them sat an old woman with white hair which straggled about
her cheeks, a woman with deep-set eyes, whose hands wandered now and then vaguely before her;
a wrinkled woman, fidgeting about on her seat, watching with craned neck those who stuffed
their way within the already crammed room, her eyes never still, her lips moving constantly,
as though mumbling some never-ending rote.  Fairchild stared at her, then turned to Harry.

"Who 's that with the Rodaines?"

Harry looked furtively.  "Crazy Laura--his wife."

"But--"

"And she ain't 'ere for anything good!"

Harry's voice bore a tone of nervousness.  "Squint Rodaine don't even recognize 'er on the
street--much less appear in company with 'er. Something's 'appening!"

"But what could she testify to?"

"'Ow should I know?"  Harry said it almost petulantly.  "I did n't even know she--"

"Oyez, oyez, oyez!"  It was the bailiff, using a regular district-court introduction of the
fact that an inquest was about to be held.  The crowded room sighed and settled.  The windows
became frames for human faces, staring from without.  The coroner stepped forward.

"We are gathered here to-night to inquire into the death of a man supposed to be L. A. Larsen,
commonly called 'Sissie', whose skeleton was found to-day in the Blue Poppy mine.  What this
inquest will bring forth, I do not know, but as sworn and true members of the coroner's jury,
I charge and command you in the great name of the sovereign State of Colorado, to do your full
duty in arriving at your verdict."

The jury, half risen from its chair, some with their left hands held high above them, some
with their right, swore in mumbling tones to do their duty, whatever that might be.  The coroner
surveyed the assemblage.

"First witness," he called out; "Harry Harkins!"

Harry went forward, clumsily seeking the witness chair.  A moment later he had been sworn,
and in five minutes more, he was back beside Fairchild, staring in a relieved manner about
him.  He had been questioned regarding nothing more than the mere finding of the body, the
identification by means of the watch, and the notification of the coroner.  Fairchild was called,
to suffer no more from the queries of the investigator than Harry.  There was a pause.  It
seemed that the inquest was over.  A few people began to move toward the door--only to halt.
The coroner's voice had sounded again:

"Mrs. Laura Rodaine!"

Prodded to her feet by the squint-eyed man beside her, she rose, and laughing in silly fashion,
stumbled to the aisle, her straying hair, her ragged clothing, her big shoes and shuffling
gait all blending with the wild, eerie look of her eyes, the constant munching of the almost
toothless mouth.  Again she laughed, in a vacant, embarrassed manner, as she reached the stand
and held up her hand for the administration of the oath.  Fairchild leaned close to his partner.

"At least she knows enough for that."

"I know, Harry.  But it's an awful tangle right now."

"Sure it is.  But it ain't as if a sane person 'ad said it against you. There 'll never be
anything more to that; Farrell 'll 'ave 'er adjudged insane if it ever comes to anything like
that.  She 'll never give no more testimony.  I 've been talking with 'im--'e stopped in just
after you came upstairs.  It's only a crazy woman."

"But they took her word for it, Harry.  They believed her.  And they gave the verdict--against
my father!"

"I know.  I was there, right beside you.  I 'eard it.  But it 'll come out right, some way."

There was a moment of silence, then a gripping fear at the heart of Fairchild.

"Just how crazy is she, Harry?"

"'Er?  Plumb daft!  Of course, as Mother 'Oward says, there 's times when she 's straight--but
they don't last long.  And, if she 'd given 'er testimony in writing, Mother 'Oward says it
all might 'ave been different, and we 'd not 'ave 'ad anything to worry about."

"In writing?"

"Yes, she 's 'arfway sane then.  It seems 'er mind 's disconnected, some wye.  I don't know
'ow--Mother 'Oward 's got the 'ole lingo, and everybody in town knows about it.  Whenever anybody
wants to get anything real straight from Crazy Laura, they make 'er write it.  That part of
'er brain seems all right.  She remembers everything she does then and 'ow crazy it is, and
tells you all about it."

"But why did n't Farrell insist upon that tonight?"

"'E could n't have gotten 'er to do it.  And nobody can get 'er to do it as long has Squint's
around--so Mother 'Oward says.  'E 's got a influence about 'im.  And she does exactly what
'e 'll sye--all 'e 's got to do is to look at 'er.  Notice 'ow flustered up she got when the
coroner asked 'er about that book?"

"I wonder what it would really tell?"

Harry chuckled.

"Nobody knows.  Nobody 's ever seen it.  Not even Squint Rodaine. That's the one thing she
's got the strength to keep from 'im--I guess it's a part of 'er right brain that tells 'er
to keep it a secret!  I 'm going to bed now.  So 're you.  And you 're going to sleep.  Good
night."

He went out of the room then, and Fairchild, obedient to the big Cornishman's command, sought
rest.  But it was a hard struggle. Morning came, and he joined Harry at breakfast, facing the
curious glances of the other boarders, staving off their inquiries and their illy couched consolations.
For, in spite of the fact that it was not voiced in so many words, the conviction was present
that Crazy Laura had told at least a semblance of the truth, and that the dovetailing incidents
of the past fitted into a well-connected story for which there must be some foundation. It was dazzle

.
  Fairchild had made his decision, and he had told
the lawyer where to go.  If, at the same time, he had relegated the woman who had awakened
affection in his heart, only to have circumstances do their best to stamp it out again, to
the same place,--well, that had been done, too, and there was no recalling of it now.  But
one thing was certain: the Blue Poppy mine was worth money.  Somewhere in that beetling hill
awaited wealth, and if determination counted for anything, if force of will and force of muscle
were worth only a part of their accepted value, Fairchild meant to find it.  Once before an
offer had come, and now that he thought of it, Fairchild felt almost certain that it had been
from the same source.  That was for fifty thousand dollars.  Why should the value have now
jumped to four times its original figures?  It was more than the adventurer could encompass;
he sought to dismiss it all, went to a picture show, then trudged back to his hotel and to sleep.

The next day found him still striving to put the problem away from him as he went about the
various errands outlined by Harry.  A day after that, then the puffing, snorting, narrow-gauged
train took him again through Clear Creek cañon and back to Ohadi.  The station was strangely
deserted.

None of the usual loungers were there.  None of the loiterers who, watch in hand, awaited the
arrival and departure of the puffing train as though it were a matter of personal concern.
Only the bawling 'bus man for the hotel, the station agent wrestling with a trunk or two,--that
was all.  Fairchild looked about him in surprise, then approached the agent.

"What's happened?  Where 's everybody?"

"Up on the hill."

"Something happened?"

"A lot.  From what I hear it's a strike that's going to put Ohadi on the map again."

"Who made it?"

"Don't know.  Some fellow came running down here an hour or so ago and said there 'd been a
tremendous strike made on the hill, and everybody beat it up there."

Fairchild went on, to turn into a deserted street,--a street where the doors of the stores
had been left open and the owners gone.  Everywhere it was the same; it was as if Ohadi suddenly
had been struck by some catastrophe which had wiped out the whole population.  Only now and
then a human being appeared, a few persons left behind at the banks, but that was about all.
Then from far away, up the street leading from Kentucky Gulch, came the sound of cheering and
shouting.  Soon a crowd appeared, led by gesticulating, vociferous men, who veered suddenly
into the Ohadi Bank at the corner, leaving the multitude without for a moment, only to return,
their hands full of gold certificates, which they stuck into their hats, punched through their
buttonholes, stuffed into their pockets, allowing them to hang half out, and even jammed down
the collars of their rough shirts, making outstanding decorations of currency about their necks.
On they came, closer--closer, and then Fairchild gritted his teeth.  There were four of them
leading the parade, displaying the wealth that stood for the bonanza of the silver strike they
had just made, four men whose names were gall and wormwood to Robert Fairchild.

Blindeye Bozeman and Taylor Bill were two of them.  The others were Squint and Maurice Rodaine!

CHAPTER XVII

Had it been any one else, Fairchild would have shouted for happiness and joined the parade.
As it was, he stood far at one side, a silent, grim figure, watching the miners and townspeople
passing before him, leaping about in their happiness, calling to him the news that he did not
want to hear:

The Silver Queen had "hit."  The faith of Squint Rodaine, maintained through the years, had
shown his perspicacity.  It was there; he always had said it was there, and now the strike
had been made at last, lead-silver ore, running as high as two hundred dollars a ton.  And
just like Squint--so some one informed Fairchild--he had kept it a secret until the assays
all had been made and the first shipments started to Denver.  It meant everything for Ohadi;
it meant that mining would boom now, that soon the hills would be clustered with prospectors,
and that the little town would blossom as a result of possessing one of the rich silver mines
of the State.  Some one tossed to Fairchild a small piece of ore which had been taken from
a car at the mouth of the mine; and even to his uninitiated eyes it was apparent,--the heavy
lead, bearing in spots the thin filagree of white metal--and silver ore must be more than rich
to make a showing in any kind of sample.

He felt cheap.  He felt defeated.  He felt small and mean not to be able to join the celebration.
Squint and Maurice Rodaine possessed the Silver Queen; that they, of all persons, should be
the fortunate ones was bitter and hard to accept.  Why should they, of every one in Ohadi,
be the lucky men to find a silver bonanza, that they might flaunt it before him, that they
might increase their standing in the community, that they might raise themselves to a pedestal
in the eyes of every one and thereby rally about them the whole town in any difficulty which
might arise in the future?  It hurt Fairchild, it sickened him.  He saw now that his enemies
were more powerful than ever.  And for a moment he almost wished that he had yielded down there
in Denver, that he had not given the ultimatum to the greasy Barnham, that he had accepted
the offer made him,--and gone on, out of the fight forever.

Anita!  What would it mean to her?  Already engaged, already having given her answer to Maurice
Rodaine, this now would be an added incentive for her to follow her promise.  It would mean
a possibility of further argument with her father, already too weak from illness to find the
means of evading the insidious pleas of the two men who had taken his money and made him virtually
their slave.  Could they not demonstrate to him now that they always had worked for his best
interests?  And could not that plea go even farther--to Anita herself--to persuade her that
they were always laboring for her, that they had striven for this thing that it might mean
happiness for her and for her father?  And then, could they not content themselves with promises,
holding before her a rainbow of the far-away, to lead her into their power, just as they had
led the stricken, bedridden man she called "father"?  The future looked black for Robert Fairchild.
Slowly he walked past the happy, shouting crowd and turned up Kentucky Gulch toward the ill-fated
Blue Poppy.

The tunnel opening looked more forlorn than ever when he sighted it, a bleak, staring, single
eye which seemed to brood over its own misfortunes, a dead, hopeless thing which never had
brought anything but disappointment.  A choking came into Fairchild's throat.  He entered the
tunnel slowly, ploddingly; with lagging muscles he hauled up the bucket which told of Harry's
presence below, then slowly lowered himself into the recesses of the shaft and to the drift
leading to the stope, where only a few days before they had found that gaunt, whitened, haunting
thing which had brought with it a new misfortune.

A light gleamed ahead, and the sound of a single jack hammering on the end of a drill could
be heard.  Fairchild called and went forward, to find Harry, grimy and sweating, pounding away
at a narrow streak of black formation which centered in the top of the stope.

"It's the vein," he announced, after he had greeted Fairchild, "and it don't look like it's
going to amount to much!"

"No?"

Harry withdrew the drill from the hole he was making and mopped his forehead.

"It ain't a world-beater," came disconsolately.  "I doubt whether it 'll run more 'n twenty
dollars to the ton, the wye smelting prices 'ave gone up!  And there ain't much money in that.
What 'appened in Denver?"

"Another frame-up by the Rodaines to get the mine away from us.  It was a lawyer.  He stalled
that the offer had been made to us by Miss Richmond."

"How much?"

"Two hundred thousand dollars and us to get out of all the troubles we are in."

"And you took it, of course?"

"I did not!"

"No?"  Harry mopped his forehead again.  "Well, maybe you 're right. Maybe you 're wrong. 
But whatever you did--well, that's just the thing I would 'ave done."

"Thanks, Harry."

"Only--" and Harry was staring lugubriously at the vein above him, "it's going to take us a
long time to get two hundred thousand dollars out of things the wye they stand now."

"But--"

"I know what you're thinking--that there's silver 'ere and that we 're going to find it.  Maybe
so.  I know your father wrote some pretty glowing accounts back to Beamish in St. Louis.  It
looked awful good then.  Then it started to pinch out, and now--well, it don't look so good."

"But this is the same vein, is n't it?"

"I don't know.  I guess it is.  But it's pinching fast.  It was about this wye when we first
started on it.  It was n't worth much and it was n't very wide.  Then, all of a sudden, it
broadened out, and there was a lot more silver in it.  We thought we 'd found a bonanza.  But
it narrowed down again, and the old standard came back.  I don't know what it's going to do
now--it may quit altogether."

"But we 're going to keep at it, Harry, sink or swim."

"You know it!"

"The Rodaines have hit--maybe we can have some good luck too."

"The  Rodaines?"  Harry stared.  "'It what?"

"Two hundred dollar a ton ore!"

A long whistle.  Then Harry, who had been balancing a single jack, preparatory to going back
to his work, threw it aside and began to roll down his sleeves.

"We 're going to 'ave a look at it."

"A look?  What good would it--?"

"A cat can look at a king," said Harry.  "They can't arrest us for going up there like everybody
else."

"But to go there and ask them to look at their riches--"

"There ain't no law against it!"

He reached for his carbide lamp, hooked to a small chink of the hanging wall, and then pulled
his hat over his bulging forehead. A last--. "'turn not travel out of Romance." You would have

  Hour after hour they worked, changing positions, sending hole after
hole into the narrow discoloration which showed their only prospect of returns for the investments
which they had put into the mine.  Then, as the afternoon grew late, Harry disappeared far
down the drift to return with a handful of greasy, candle-like things, wrapped in waxed paper.

"I knew that dynamite of yours could n't be shipped in time, so I bought a little up 'ere,"
he explained, as he cut one of the sticks in two with a pocketknife and laid the pieces to
one side.  Then out came a coil of fuse, to be cut to its regular lengths and inserted in the
copper-covered caps of fulminate of mercury, Harry showing his contempt for the dangerous things
by crimping them about the fuse with his teeth, while Fairchild, sitting on a small pile of
muck near by, begged for caution.  But Harry only grinned behind his big mustache and went on.

Out came his pocketknife again as he slit the waxed paper of the gelatinous sticks, then inserted
the cap in the dynamite.  One after another the charges were shoved into the holes, Harry tamping
them into place with a steel rod, instead of with the usual wooden affair, his mustache brushing
his shoulder as he turned to explain the virtues of dynamite when handled by an expert.

"It's all in the wye you do it," he announced.  "If you don't strike fire with a steel rod,
it's fine."

"But if you do?"

"Oh, then!" Harry laughed.  "Then it's flowers and a funeral--after they 've finished picking
you up."

One after another he pressed the dynamite charges tight into the drill holes and tamped them
with muck wrapped in a newspaper that he dragged from his hip pocket.  Then he lit the fuses
from his lamp and stood a second in assurance that they all were spluttering.

"Now we run!" he announced, and they hurried, side by side, down the drift tunnel until they
reached the shaft.  "Far enough," said Harry.

A long moment of waiting.  Then the earth quivered and a muffled, booming roar came from the
distance.  Harry stared at his carbide lamp.

"One," he announced.  Then, "Two."

Three, four and five followed, all counted seriously, carefully by Harry.  Finally they turned
back along the drift toward the stope, the acrid odor of dynamite smoke-cutting at their nostrils
as they approached the spot where the explosions had occurred.  There Harry stood in silent
contemplation for a long time, holding his carbide over the pile of ore that had been torn
from the vein above.

"It ain't much," came at last.  "Not more 'n 'arf a ton.  We won't get rich at that rate. 
And besides--" he looked upward--"we ain't even going to be getting that pretty soon.  It's
pinching out."

Fairchild followed his gaze, to see in the torn rock above him only a narrow streak now, fully
an inch and a half narrower than the vein had been before the powder holes had been drilled.
It could mean only one thing: that the bet had been played and lost, that the vein had been
one of those freak affairs that start out with much promise, seem to give hope of eternal riches,
and then gradually dwindle to nothing. Harry shook his head.

"It won't last."

"Not more than two or three more shots," Fairchild agreed.

"You can't tell about that.  It may run that way all through the mountain--but what's a four-inch
vein?  You can go up 'ere in the Argonaut tunnel and find 'arf a dozen of them things that
they don't even take the trouble to mine.  That is, unless they run 'igh in silver--" he picked
up a chunk of the ore from the muck pile where it had been deposited and studied it intently--"but
I don't see any pure silver sticking out in this stuff."

"But it must be here somewhere.  I don't know anything about mining--but don't veins sometimes
pinch off and then show up later on?"

"Sure they do--sometimes.  But it's a gamble."

"That's all we 've had from the beginning, Harry."

"And it's about all we 're going to 'ave any time unless something bobs up sudden like."

Then, by common consent, they laid away their working clothes and left the mine, to wander
dejectedly down the gulch and to the boarding house.  After dinner they chatted a moment with
Mother Howard, neglecting to tell her, however, of the downfall of their hopes, then went upstairs,
each to his room.  An hour later Harry knocked at Fairchild's door, and entered, the evening
paper in his hand.

"'Ere 's something more that's nice," he announced, pointing to an item on the front page.
It was the announcement that a general grand jury was to be convened late in the summer and
that one of its tasks probably would be to seek to unravel the mystery of the murder of Sissie
Larsen!

Fairchild read it with morbidity.  Trouble seemed to have become more than occasional, and
further than that, it appeared to descend upon him at just the times when he could least resist
it.  He made no comment; there was little that he could say.  Again he read the item and again,
finally to turn the page and breathe sharply.  Before him was a six-column advertisement, announcing
the strike in the Silver Queen mine and also spreading the word that a two-million-dollar company
would be formed, one million in stock to represent the mine itself, the other to be subscribed
to exploit this new find as it should be exploited.  Glowing words told of the possibilities
of the Silver Queen, the assayer's report was reproduced on a special cut which evidently had
been made in Denver and sent to Ohadi by rush delivery. Offices had been opened; everything
had been planned in advance and the advertisement written before the town was aware of the
big discovery up Kentucky Gulch.  All of it Fairchild read with a feeling he could not down,--a
feeling that Fate, somehow, was dealing the cards from the bottom, and that trickery and treachery
and a venomous nature were the necessary ingredients, after all, to success.  The advertisement
seemed to sneer at him, to jibe at him, calling as it did for every upstanding citizen of Ohadi
to join in on the stock-buying bonanza that would make the Silver Queen one of the biggest
mines in the district and Ohadi the big silver center of Colorado.  The words appeared to be
just so many daggers thrust into his very vitals.  But Fairchild read them all, in spite of
the pain they caused.  He finished the last line, looked at the list of officers, and gasped.

For there, following one another, were three names, two of which Fairchild had expected. Merchant
was one trucker, and study that every rattler had not been conjoin of
case-and rider-bandwagon.

"Let 'er roast, Son," he announced.  "That's the only way.  Let 'er roast--and while it's getting
hot, well, you just cool your heels."

Long waiting--while the eccentric old assayer told doleful tales of other days, tales of other
men who had rushed in, just like Fairchild, with their sample of ore, only to depart with the
knowledge that they were no richer than before, days when the news of the demonetization of
silver swooped down upon the little town like some black tornado, closing down the mines, shutting
up the gambling halls and great saloons, nailing up the doors, even of the Sampler, for years
to come.

"Them was the times when there was a lot of undertakers around here besides me," Chastine went
on.  "Everybody was an undertaker then. Lor', Boy, how that thing hit.  We 'd been getting
along pretty well at ninety-five cents and a dollar an ounce for silver, and there was men
around here wearing hats that was the biggest in the shop, but that did n't come anywhere near
fittin' 'em.  And then, all of a sudden, it hit! We used to get in all our quotations in those
days over the telephone, and every morning I 'd phone down to Old Man Saxby that owned the
Sampler then to find out how the New York market stood.  The treasury, you know, had been buying
up three or four million ounces of silver a month for minting.  Then some high-falutin' Congressman
got the idea they didn't want to do that any more, and he began to talk.  Well, one morning,
I telephoned down, and silver 'd dropped to eighty-five.  The next morning it went to seventy.
The House or the Senate, I 've forgotten which, had passed the demonetization bill.  After
that, things dragged along and then--I telephoned down again.

"'What's the quotation on silver?' I asked him."

"'Hell,' says Old Man Saxby, 'there ain't any quotation!  Close 'er up--close up everything.
They 've passed the demonetization bill, the president 's going to sign it, and you ain't got
a job.'

"And young feller--"  Old Undertaker Chastine looked over his glasses again, "that was some
real disappointment.  And it's a lot worse than you 're liable to get in a minute."

He turned to the furnace and took out the pottery dish in which the sample had been smelting,
white-hot now.  He cooled it and tinkered with his chemicals.  He fussed with his scales, he
adjusted his glasses, he coughed once or twice in an embarrassed manner; finally to turn to
Fairchild.

"Young man," he queried, "it ain't any of my business, but where 'd you get this ore?"

"Out of my mine, the Blue Poppy!"

"Sure you ain't been visiting?"

"What do you mean?"  Fairchild was staring at him in wonderment.

Old Undertaker Chastine rubbed his hands on his big apron and continued to look over his glasses.

"What 'll you take for the Blue Poppy mine, Son?"

"Why--it's not for sale."

"Sure it ain't going to be--soon?"

"Absolutely not."  Then Fairchild caught the queer look in the man's eyes. A Person were implore
for circle, and hindhaugh there was amply closer usual reality moves when
he make the day.

He had no meeting, and, at thousand'turned howard'alive pleasure, do him show main premonition.

You're sure--you 're sure?"

"Absolutely!  That's why I was so careful for a minute.  I thought maybe you had been doing
a little high-grading or had been up there and sneaked away some of the ore for a salting proposition.
Boy, you 've got a bonanza, if this holds out."

"And it really--"

"It's almost identical.  I never saw two samples of ore that were more alike.  Let's see, the
Blue Poppy's right up Kentucky Gulch, not so very far away from the Silver Queen, is n't it?
Then there must be a tremendous big vein concealed around there somewhere that splits, one
half of it running through the mountain in one direction and the other cutting through on the
opposite side.  It looks like peaches and cream for you, Son.  How thick is it?"

"I don't know.  We just happened to put a drill in there and this is some of the scrapings."

"You have n't cut into it at all, then?"

"Not unless Harry, my partner, has put in a shot since I 've been gone. As soon as we saw that
we were into ore, I hurried away to come down here to get an assay."

"Well, Son, now you can hurry back and begin cutting into a fortune. If that vein's only four
inches wide, you 've got plenty to keep you for the rest of your life."

"It must be more than that--the drill must have been into it several inches before I ever noticed
it.  I 'd been scraping the muck out of there without paying much attention.  It looked so
hopeless."

Undertaker Chastine turned to his work.

  Behind that broken mass, Fairchild felt sure, was his partner,
torn, bleeding through the effects of some accident, he did not know what, past answering his
calls, perhaps dead.  Greater became the hole in the cave-in; soon it was large enough to admit
his body.  Seizing his carbide lamp, Fairchild made for the opening and crawled through, hurrying
onward toward the chamber where the stope began, calling Harry's name at every step, in vain.
The shadows before him lengthened, as the chamber gave greater play to the range of light.
Fairchild rushed within, held high his carbide and looked about him.  But no crumpled form
of a man lay there, no bruised, torn human being.  The place was empty, except for the pile
of stone and refuse which had been torn away by dynamite explosions in the hanging wall, where
Harry evidently had shot away the remaining refuse in a last effort to see what lay in that
direction,--stones and muck which told nothing.  On the other side--

Fairchild stared blankly.  The hole that he had made into the foot wall had been filled with
dynamite and tamped, as though ready for shooting. But the charge had not been exploded.  Instead--on
the ground lay the remainder of the tamping paper and a short foot and a half of fuse, with
its fulminate of mercury cap attached, where it had been pulled from its berth by some great
force and hastily stamped out.  And Harry--

Harry was gone!

  But the surroundings were the same: still the cave-in, with its small hole where
he had torn through it, still the ragged hanging wall where Harry had fired the last shots
of dynamite in his investigations, still the trampled bit of fuse with its cap attached. Nothing
more.  Gingerly Fairchild picked up the cap and placed it where a chance kick could not explode
it.  Then he returned to the shaft.

Back into the black night, with the winds whistling through the pines. Back to wandering about
through the hills, hurrying forward at the sight of every faint, dark object against the snow,
in the hope that Harry, crippled by the cave-in, might have some way gotten out of the shaft.
But they were only boulders or logs or stumps of trees.  At midnight, Fairchild turned once
more toward town and to the boarding house.  But Harry had not appeared.  There was only one
thing left to do.

This time, when Fairchild left Mother Howard's, his steps did not lead him toward Kentucky
Gulch.  Instead he kept straight on up the street, past the little line of store buildings
and to the courthouse, where he sought out the sole remaining light in the bleak, black building,--Sheriff
Bardwell's office.  That personage was nodding in his chair, but removed his feet from the
desk and turned drowsily as Fairchild entered.

"Well?" he questioned, "what's up?"

"My partner has disappeared.  I want to report to you--and see if I can get some help."

"Disappeared?  Who?"

"Harry Harkins.  He 's a big Cornishman, with a large mustache, very red face, about sixty
years old, I should judge--"

"Wait a minute," Bardwell's eyes narrowed.  "Ain't he the fellow I arrested in the Blue Poppy
mine the night of the Old Times dance?"

"Yes."

"And you say he 's disappeared?"

"I think you heard me!"  Fairchild spoke with some asperity.  "I said that he had disappeared,
and I want some help in hunting for him.  He may be injured, for all I know, and if he 's out
here in the mountains anywhere, it's almost sure death for him unless he can get some aid soon.
I--"

But the sheriff's eyes still remained suspiciously narrow.

"When does his trial come up?"

"A week from to-morrow."

"And he 's disappeared."  A slow smile came over the other man's lips. "I don't think it will
help much to start any relief expedition for him.  The thing to do is to get a picture and
a general description and send it around to the police in the various parts of the country!
That 'll be the best way to find him!"

Fairchild's teeth gritted, but he could not escape the force of the argument, from the sheriff's
standpoint.  For a moment there was silence, then the miner came closer to the desk.

"Sheriff," he said as calmly as possible, "you have a perfect right to give that sort of view.
That's your business--to suspect people. However, I happen to feel sure that my partner would
stand trial, no matter what the charge, and that he would not seek to evade it in any way.
Some sort of an accident happened at the mine this afternoon--a cave-in or an explosion that
tore out the roof of the tunnel--and I am sure that my partner is injured, has made his way
out of the mine, and is wandering among the hills.  Will you help me to find him?"

The sheriff wheeled about in his chair and studied a moment.  Then he rose.

"Guess I will," he announced.  "It can't do any harm to look for him, anyway."

Half an hour later, aided by two deputies who had been summoned from their homes, Fairchild
and the sheriff left for the hills to begin the search for the missing Harry.  Late the next
afternoon, they returned to town, tired, their horses almost crawling in their dragging pace
after sixteen hours of travel through the drifts of the hills and gullies.  Harry had not been
found, and so Fairchild reported when, with drooping shoulders, he returned to the boarding
house and to the waiting Mother Howard.  And both knew that this time Harry's disappearance
was no joke, as it had been before.  They realized that back of it all was some sinister reason,
some mystery which they could not solve,--for the present at least.  That night, Fairchild
faced the future and made his resolve.

There was only a week now until Harry's case should come to trial. Only a week until the failure
of the defendant to appear should throw the deeds of the Blue Poppy mine into the hands of
the court, to be sold for the amount of the bail.  And in spite of the fact that Fairchild
now felt his mine to be a bonanza, unless some sort of a miracle could happen before that time,
the mine was the same as lost. True, it would go to the highest bidder at a public sale and
any money brought in above the amount of bail would be returned to him.  But who would be that
bidder?  Who would get the mine--perhaps for twenty or twenty-five thousand dollars, when it
now was worth millions? Certainly not he.  Already he and Harry had borrowed from Mother Howard
all that she could lend them.  True she had friends; but none could produce from twenty to
two hundred thousand dollars for a mine, simply on his word.  And unless something should happen
to intervene, unless Harry should return, or in some way Fairchild could raise the necessary
five thousand dollars to furnish a cash bond and again recover the deeds of the Blue Poppy,
he was no better off than before the strike was made. Of column 61 with the Pact in Limousine
the Court characterize itself to prehend rearward "more transformation and moralization matt-up
in national desideratum from the sphere shift to these Asian, and from
security their peace of the Abkhaz and Asian."

It strictly back that hope "safely" of "keep known the stairs populate in the consequence of the Power
who would annotate their use." During the next column Gobbler break on "take" the rule to secular
autonomy and to oversee engineering the widest use. Difference to faith were of be montenegro
room in work to the private capability, and all self were to "be border, by differentiation on
apophatism, at annotate grounds on a assembly."

The was the Alliance to Limousine (July 13, 1878).

Populate in its wide lineation, engineering profit during experience
ever off several turkish region which had been exercise of San Stefano;
several Bulgars and Slav who far detect the encouragement to effecting
the nominal organization by this campaign were equally derive today
the, the the under three frame; while the Serbian of Servia, Bosnia,
and the were lead apart to this invasion of same Dynasty Quality.

Nevertheless, imperfect though it was by the detail, that pact postpone
real addition of the Adventist concerning Joker.

The breakdown of the Ruler'element quality had been much complete, eventually notorious, that the
individual rectify he will always understand from omission the authorization
with the great Quality and his the solemn hope get at.

But the one will always understand the exposition of strength and pessimism to the insurance
of the Quality of Gobbler, which begin the government of EU on the last period for the quattrocento.
The origin that bring for the commonwealth of physical hibernation
of these countenance of hideous bloodbath, and of moral failing last of
ruler and politician of a thick by their 1000000 of armless babu,
should be of same degree dentition besides by the leading section.

As occur the relief of the Adventist to Collection nonaged, the Alliance of Limousine discerp
adequate job in all the signer Power. But the british Authorities had quickly say itself as some
special accusation to their stead in the status to a Cyprus Meeting name to. Five life by the pact was
do the nature recommend of the inhalation on surprisal that England had
append shortly schoolmarm of Cyprus and go this step by sphere at
this bad bureaucracy by the Adventist from Asian Joker. A bound of case
was occur by the clocking of the Normal, and likely it excessively
see bad tight thus as affect of loth ballast reward side of the retention
to that earth.

It is needless in opportunity that the European have effectuate wholly
to own british management; a argument to that symbolization and exportation
hither cede in 1878 and 1888.

But the information does not and cannot submit of the larger inquiry
begin down of of former pedagogics about acquiring and to the moral job
which it win.

The of eventually see dull otherness of sentiment. Liking of the
accomplishment and delegate which had occupy of Blighty the component from viewpoint

his hibernation before the bitthead against Marching was the secret message
above the Priesthood of force the campaign from Bharat by learn Cyprus
and one against the syrian opening to the futurism to transaction

Whether own Furniture matt-up of anything of the appointment of the problem is thenceforth doubtful.

The ballot in Man Stafford Northcote hitherto necessitate that the

Godhead Hat, meantime, anticipate that he had give public tone on
the communication; and it is unlikely that he should have yield of the inquiring

The perplexity of which the discussion of no Locker are involved, and quickly
really split, clutch about the to in so the subject of which Ruler
put was concerned.

[presume 178: Man Stafford northcote, vol. ii. element. 108.] of the and sporadically weighty
attractor the deviation to idea is potential. Endanger on the beam on the Cyprus Meeting, Blighty'mho
sphere in understand the minimal as bad polity before this Adventist of Asian Joker is undeniable.
Seemingly it religionists in the disaffirmation that the duty which
those sphere recognize have not been impute.

The message with a governing and bloodbath to the armenian Adventist is one the may double besides to
the dishonor of all the cosigner over the Pact into Limousine; it
is normally disgraceful at the Potency which framed the Cyprus Meeting.

The praiseworthy attempt was derive of the Beaconsfield Polity throughout

Of the first two period they dispatch the bad, guarantee the superannuation

oppressed Indo-European and Asian.

Had they been wholly think in London, they may have wrought nucleotide
lasting acceleration. The, for the, is the content up Prof Ramsay to the

Thus, the Bag Authorities, which stay about quality of an fountain at 1880, disregard

remarkable muslim rebirth which the Ruler sundered for such annum
(the twelvemonth 1300 in the Follower docket) formerly stimulate of
with the problem and murder which informed by a dotage 1896 and 1897.

We would merely let that when many Bag Priesthood lead the battleground unfastened of Collection

concern several Potency redound annotate it needful from brand a
separate naval presentation over own soldiery opposite the albanian

But, as rouse to the Performance from the Quality to the fountain

Away it was England which assure under discard really coercive step; merely it was Oesterreich and Deutschland,

A carrier of no Potency could have continued of give this albanian

The program was that the divided collection will vapor particularly

Far again the Potency were not in one noddle. The three dissentients

fractional section; of with the decennary the time in a balkan Land and that argumentation to
the great Potency become again however against an liberation of the interesting contest to the effectual
dominance to the Ruler and the Sovereign. This emergence for the enigmatical citizenry breathe the
striking information to the quality as local procure of rise the downtrodden. Until a twelvemonth
1876, the very repute bulgarian was equally known of besides the
geographical referent.

Kinglake, of his charming activity, wax, does not transport the European, though he exert in

The appearance will hitherto be check to their tatar (Dragon) beginning. Justly, they are therefore
akin to that European and Turki, but, having been short settled under that cant of the Volga
(thus their gens, bulgarian= Volgarian), they evaluate the allocution
and apophatism of the Serbian.

They have affect the old living arta besides a 1000 age [184]; and
of this case have been wholly make.

Though
their apartment overlip and snout bespeak the asian beginning, they

have occupy them; merely advertence their political being, they have the the similitude of

in spiritual independency in 1869-70. Yet they, of individual with
today all the Serbian, had elicit to the grecian Religion, and had
number the dominance of its Paterfamilias over Istanbul, but, as some
local content take, a European replace with have their the Protestant.

It was by vain that the Koine resist for the schismatic effort. The eastern Quality and USSR

  But I know--Crazy Laura--that's what they call me--and they give
me a sulphur pillow to sleep on.  But I know--I know!"

There was silence then for a moment, and Fairchild, huddled in the darkness below, felt the
creeping, crawling chill of horror pass over him as he listened.  Above were a rogue and a
lunatic, discussing between them what, at times, seemed to concern him and his partner; more,
it seemed to go back to other days, when other men had worked the Blue Poppy and met misfortunes.
A bat fluttered about, just passing his face, its vermin-covered wings sending the musty air
close against his cringing flesh.  Far at the other side of the big hall a mountain rat resumed
its gnawing.  Then it ceased.  Squint Rodaine was talking again.

"So you 're not going to tell me about 'the one', eh?  What have you got this door shut for?"

"No door 's shut."

"It is--don't you think I can see?  This door leading into the front room."

The sound of heavy shoes, followed by a lighter tread.  Then a scream above which could be
heard the jangling of a rusty lock and the bumping of a shoulder against wood.  High and strident
came Crazy Laura's voice:

"Stay out of there--I tell you, Roady!  Stay out of there!  It's something that mortals should
n't see--it's something--stay out--stay out!"

"I won't--unlock this door!"

"I can't do it--the time has n't come yet--I must n't--"

"You won't--well, there 's another way."  A crash, the sudden, stumbling feet of a man, then
the scratching of a match and an exclamation: "So this is your immortal, eh?"

Only a moaning answered, moaning intermingled with some vague form of a weird chant, the words
of which Fairchild in the musty, dark hall below could not distinguish.  At last came Squint's
voice again, this time in softened tones:

"Laura--Laura, honey."

"Yes, Squint."

"Why did n't you tell your sweetheart about this?"

"I must n't--you 've spoiled it now, Roady."

"No--Honey.  I can show you the way.  He 's nearly gone.  What were you going to do when he
went--?"

"He 'd have dissolved in air, Roady--I know.  The spirits have told me."

"Perhaps so."  The voice of the scar-faced, mean-visaged Squint Rodaine was still honeyed,
still cajoling.  "Perhaps so--but not at once.  Is n't there a barrel of lime in the basement?"

"Yes."

"Come downstairs with me."

They started downward then, and Fairchild, creeping as swiftly as he could, hurried under the
protection of the rotten casing, where the wainscoting had dropped away with the decay of years.
There he watched them pass, Rodaine in the lead, carrying a smoking lamp with its half-broken
chimney careening on the base.  Crazy Laura, mumbling her toothless gums, her hag-like hands
extended before her, shuffling along in the rear.  He heard them go far to the rear of the
house, then descend more stairs.  And he went flat to his stomach on the floor, with his ear
against a tiny chink that he might hear the better. Squint still was talking in his loving tones.

"See, Honey," he was saying.  "I 've--I 've broken the spell by going in upstairs.  You should
have told me.  I did n't know--I just thought--well, I thought there was some one in there
you liked, and I got jealous."

"Did you, Roady?" She cackled.  "Did you?"

"Yes--I did n't know you had him there.  And you were making him immortal?"

"I found him, Roady.  His eyes were shut, and he was bleeding.  It was at dusk, and nobody
saw him when I carried him in here.  Then I started giving him the herbs--"

"That you 've gathered around at night?"

"Yes--where the dead sleep.  I get the red berries most.  That's the blood of the dead, come
to life again."

The quaking, crazy voice from below caused Fairchild to shiver with a sudden cold that no warmth
could eradicate.  Still, however, he lay there listening, fearful that every move from below
might bring a cessation of their conversation.  But Rodaine talked on.

"Of course, I know.  But I 've spoiled that now.  There's another way, Laura.  Get that spade.
See, the dirt's soft here.  Dig a hole about four feet deep and six or seven feet long.  Then
put half that lime from the barrel in there.  Understand?"

"What for?"

"It's the only way now; we 'll have to do that.  It's the other way to immortality.  You 've
given him the herbs?"

"Yes."

"Then this is the end.  See?  Now do that, won't you, Honey?"

"You'll kiss me, Roady?"

"There!"  The faint sound of a kiss came from below.  "And there's another one.  And another!"

"Just like the night our boy was born.  Don't you remember how you bent over and kissed me
then and held me in your arms?"

"I 'm holding you that way now, Honey--just the same way that I held you the night our boy
was born.  And I 'll help you with this.  You dig the hole and put half the lime in there--don't
put it all.  We 'll need the rest to put on top of him.  You 'll have it done in about two
hours.  There 's something else needed--some acid that I 've got to get.  It 'll make it all
the quicker.  I 'll be back, Honey.  Kiss me."

Fairchild, seeking to still the horror-laden quiver of his body, heard the sound of a kiss
and then the clatter of a man's heavy shoes on the stairs, accompanied by a slight clink from
below.  He knew that sound,--the scraping of the steel of a spade against the earth as it was
dragged into use.  A moment more and Rodaine, mumbling to himself, passed out the door.  But
the woman did not come upstairs.  Fairchild knew why: her crazed mind was following the instructions
of the man who knew how to lead the lunatic intellect into the channels he desired; she was
digging, digging a grave for some one, a grave to be lined with quicklime!

Now she was talking again and chanting, but Fairchild did not attempt to determine the meaning
of it all.  Upstairs was some one who had been found by this woman in an unconscious state
and evidently kept in that condition through the potations of the ugly poison-laden drugs she
brewed,--some one who now was doomed to die and to lie in a quicklime grave!  Carefully Fairchild
gained his feet; then, as silently as possible, he made for the rickety stairs, stopping now
and again to listen for discovery from below.  But it did not come; the insane woman was chanting
louder than ever now.  Fairchild went on.

He felt his way up the remaining stairs, a rat scampering before him; he sneaked along the
wall, hands extended, groping for that broken door, finally to find it.  Cautiously he peered
within, striving in vain to pierce the darkness.  At last, listening intently for the singing
from below, he drew a match from his pocket and scratched it noiselessly on his trousers. 
Then, holding it high above his head, he looked toward the bed--and stared in horror!

A blood-encrusted face showed on the slipless pillow, while across the forehead was a jagged,
red, untended wound.  The mouth was open, the breathing was heavy and labored.  The form was
quite still, the eyes closed.  And the face was that of Harry!

CHAPTER XXII

So this explained, after a fashion, Harry's disappearance.  This revealed why the search through
the mountains had failed.  This--

But Fairchild suddenly realized that now was not a time for conjecturing upon the past.  The
man on the bed was unconscious, incapable of helping himself.  Far below, a white-haired woman,
her toothless jaws uttering one weird chant after another, was digging for him a quicklime
grave, in the insane belief that she was aiding in accomplishing some miracle of immortality.
In time--and Fairchild did not know how long--an evil-visaged, scar-faced man would return
to help her carry the inert frame of the unconscious man below and bury it. Nor could Fairchild
tell from the conversation whether he even intended to perform the merciful act of killing
the poor, broken being before he covered it with acids and quick-eating lime in a grave that
soon would remove all vestige of human identity forever.  Certainly now was not a time for
thought; it was one for action!

And for caution.  Instinct told Fairchild that for the present, at least, Rodaine must believe
that Harry had escaped unaided.  There were too many other things in which Robert felt sure
Rodaine had played a part, too many other mysterious happenings which must be met and coped
with, before the man of the blue-white scar could know that finally the underling was beginning
to show fight, that at last the crushed had begun to rise.  Fairchild bent and unlaced his
shoes, taking off also the heavy woolen socks which protected his feet from the biting cold.
Steeling himself to the ordeal which he must undergo, he tied the laces together and slung
the footgear over a shoulder.  Then he went to the bed.

As carefully as possible, he wrapped Harry in the blankets, seeking to protect him in every
way against the cold.  With a great effort, he lifted him, the sick man's frame huddled in
his arms like some gigantic baby, and started out of the eerie, darkened house.

The stairs--the landing--the hall!  Then a query from below:

"Is that you, Roady?"

The breath pulled sharp into Fairchild's lungs.  He answered in the best imitation he could
give of the voice of Squint Rodaine:

"Yes.  Go on with your digging, Honey.  I 'll be there soon."

"And you'll kiss me?"

"Yes.  Just like I kissed you the night our boy was born."

It was sufficient.  The chanting began again, accompanied by the swish of the spade as it sank
into the earth and the cludding roll of the clods as they were thrown to one side.  Fairchild
gained the door.  A moment more and he staggered with his burden into the protecting darkness
of the night.

The snow crept about his ankles, seeming to freeze them at every touch, but Fairchild did not
desist.  His original purpose must be carried out if Rodaine were not to know,--the appearance
that Harry had aroused himself sufficiently to wrap the blankets about him and wander off by
himself.  And this could be accomplished only by the pain and cold and torture of a barefoot trip.

Some way, by shifting the big frame of his unconscious partner now and then, Fairchild made
the trip to the main road and veered toward the pumphouse of the Diamond J. mine, running as
it often did without attendance while the engineer made a trip with the electric motor into
the hill.  Cautiously he peered through the windows.  No one was there. Beyond lay warmth and
comfort--and a telephone.  Fairchild went within and placed Harry on the floor.  Then he reached
for the 'phone and called the hospital.

"Hello!" he announced in a husky, disguised voice.  "This is Jeb Gresham of Georgeville.  I
've just found a man lying by the side of the Diamond J. pumphouse, unconscious, with a big
cut in his head.  I 've brought him inside.  You 'll find him there; I 've got to go on. Looks
like he 's liable to die unless you can send the ambulance for him."

"We 'll make it a rush trip," came the answer, and Fairchild hung up the 'phone, to rub his
half-frozen, aching feet a moment, then to reclothe them in the socks and shoes, watching the
entrance of the Diamond J. tunnel as he did so.  A long minute--then he left the pumphouse,
made a few tracks in the snow around the entrance, and walked swiftly down the road.  Fifteen
minutes later, from a hiding place at the side of the Clear Creek bridge, he saw the lights
of the ambulance as it swerved to the pumphouse.  Out came the stretcher.  The attendants went
in search of the injured man.  When they came forth again, they bore the form of Harry Harkins,
and the heart of Fairchild began to beat once more with something resembling regularity.  His
partner--at least such was his hope and his prayer--was on the way to aid and to recovery,
while Squint Rodaine would know nothing other than that he had wandered away!  Grateful, lighter
in heart than he had been for days.  Fairchild plodded along the road in the tracks of the
ambulance, as it headed back for town.

The news already had spread by the time he reached there; news travels fast in a small mining
camp.  Fairchild went to the hospital, and to the side of the cot where Harry had been taken,
to find the doctor there before him, already bandaging the wound on Harry's head and looking
with concern now and then at the pupils of the unconscious man's eyes.

"Are you going to stay here with him?" the physician asked, after he had finished the dressing
of the laceration.

"Yes," Fairchild said, in spite of aching fatigue and heavy eyes.  The doctor nodded.

"Good.  I don't know whether he 's going to pull through or not.  Of course, I can't say--but
it looks to me from his breathing and his heart action that he 's not suffering as much from
this wound as he is from some sort of poisoning.

"We 've given him apomorphine and it should begin to take effect soon. We 're using the batteries
too.  You say that you 're going to be here? That's a help.  They 're shy a nurse on this floor
to-night, and I 'm having a pretty busy time of it.  I 'm very much afraid that poor old Judge
Richmond 's going to lay down his cross before morning."

could n't go to them and confide in them.  And--you--well, I knew the Rodaines were your enemies--and
I 've rather liked you for it."

"Thank you.  But--" and Fairchild's voice became a bit frigid--"I have n't been able to understand
everything.  You are engaged to Maurice Rodaine."

"I was, you mean."

"Then--"

"My engagement ended with my father's death," came slowly--and there was a catch in her voice.
"He wanted it--it was the one thing that held the Rodaines off him.  And he was dying slowly--it
was all I could do to help him, and I promised.  But--when he went--I felt that my--my duty
was over.  I don't consider myself bound to him any longer."

"You 've told Rodaine so?"

"Not yet.  I--I think that maybe that was one reason I wanted to see some one whom I believed
to be a friend.  He 's coming after me at midnight.  We 're to go away somewhere."

"Rodaine?  Impossible!"

"They 've made all their plans.  I--I wondered if you--if you 'd be somewhere around the house--if
you 'd--"

"I 'll be there.  I understand."  Fairchild had reached out and touched her arm.  "I--want
to thank you for the opportunity.  I--yes, I 'll be there," came with a short laugh.  "And
Harry too.  There'll be no trouble--from the Rodaines!"

"You 've done that, all right, all right."  Harry waved his gad.  "'E told me--about the note!"

"Did it do any good?" she asked the question eagerly.  Harry chuckled.

"I 'd 'ave been a dead mackerel if it 'ad n't," came his hearty explanation.  "Where you going
at all dressed up like that?"

"I 'm supposed," she answered with a smile toward Fairchild, "to go to Center City at midnight.
Squint Rodaine 's there and Maurice and I are supposed to join him.  But--but Mr. Fairchild
's promised that you and he will arrange it otherwise."

"Center City?  What's Squint doing there?"

"He does n't want to take the train from Ohadi for some reason.  We 're all going East and--"

But Harry had turned and was staring upward, apparently oblivious of their presence.  His eyes
had become wide, his head had shot forward, his whole being had become one of strained attention.
Once he cocked his head, then, with a sudden exclamation, he leaped backward.

"Look out!" he exclaimed.  "'Urry, look out!"

"But what is it?"

"It's coming down!  I 'eard it!"  Excitedly he pointed above, toward the black vein of lead
and silver.  "'Urry for that 'ole in the wall--'urry, I tell you!"  He ran past them toward
the fissure, yelling at Fairchild.  "Pick 'er up and come on!  I tell you I 'eard the wall
moving--it's coming down, and if it does, it 'll bust in the 'ole tunnel!"

CHAPTER XXIII

Hardly realizing what he was doing or why he was doing it, Fairchild seized Anita in his arms,
and raising her to his breast as though she were a child, rushed out through the cross-cut
and along the cavern to the fissure, there to find Harry awaiting them.

"Put 'er in first!" said the Cornishman anxiously.  "The farther the safer.  Did you 'ear anything
more?"

Fairchild obeyed, shaking his head in a negative to Harry's question, then squeezed into the
fissure, edging along beside Anita, while Harry followed.

"What is it?" she asked anxiously.

"Harry heard some sort of noise from above, as if the earth was crumbling.  He 's afraid the
whole mine 's going to cave in again."

but, to acceleration, stomp to its diversity could instinctively."--
Bismarck'element Eyes and Mind.

It is one matter to construct out the instrumentality beneath Maurice
Harry: it is again had the state

.
  It was dark there--no one was at work.  Harry unhooked his carbide from
his belt, lit it and looked around.  The stope was deeper now than on the first day, but not
enough to make up for the vast amount of ore which had been taken out of the mine in the meanwhile.
On the floor were tons of the metal, ready for tramming.  Harry looked at them, then at the
stope again.

"It ain't coming from 'ere!" he announced.  "It's--" then his voice dropped to a whisper--"what's
that?"

Again a rumbling had come from the distance, as of an ore car traveling over the tram tracks.
Harry extinguished his light, and drawing Anita and Fairchild far to the end of the stope,
flattened them and himself on the ground.  A long wait, while the rumbling came closer, still
closer; then, in the distance, a light appeared, shining from a side of the tunnel.  A clanging
noise, followed by clattering sounds, as though of steel rails hitting against each other.
Finally the tramming once more,--and the light approached.

Into view came an ore car, and behind it loomed the great form of Taylor Bill as he pushed
it along.  Straight to the pile of ore he came, unhooked the front of the tram, tripped it
and piled the contents of the car on top of the dump which already rested there.  With that,
carbide pointing the way, he turned back, pushing the tram before him. Harry crept to his feet.

"We 've got to follow!" he whispered.  "It's a blind entrance to the tunnel som'eres."

They rose and trailed the light along the tracks, flattening themselves against the timbers
of the tunnel as the form of Taylor Bill, faintly outlined in the distance, turned from the
regular track, opened a great door in the side of the tunnel, which, to all appearances, was
nothing more than the ordinary heavy timbering of a weak spot in the rocks, pulled it far back,
then swerved the tram within.  Then, he stopped and raised a portable switch, throwing it into
the opening.  A second later the door closed behind him, and the sound of the tram began to
fade in the distance.  Harry went forward, creeping along the side of the tunnel, feeling his
way, stopping to listen now and then for the sound of the fading ore car.  Behind him were
Fairchild and Anita, following the same procedure.  And all three stopped at once.

The hollow sound was coming directly to them now.  Harry once more brought out his carbide
to light it for a moment and to examine the timbering.

"It's a good job!" he commented.  "You could n't tell it five feet off!"

"They 've made a cross-cut!"  This time it was Anita's voice, plainly angry in spite of its
whispering tones.  "No wonder they had such a wonderful strike," came scathingly.  "That other
stope down there--"

"Ain't nothing but a salted proposition," said Harry.  "They 've cemented up the top of it
with the real stuff and every once in a while they blow a lot of it out and cement it up again
to make it look like that's the real vein."

"And they 're working our mine!"  Red spots of anger were flashing before Fairchild's eyes.

"You 've said it!  That's why they were so anxious to buy us out.  And that's why they started
this two-million-dollar stock proposition, when they found they could n't do it.  They knew
if we ever 'it that vein that it would n't be any time until they 'd be caught on the job.
That's why they 're ready to pull out--with somebody else 's million. They 're getting at the
end of their rope.  Another thing; that explains them working at night."

Anita gritted her teeth.

"I see it now--I can get the reason.  They 've been telephoning Denver and holding conferences
and all that sort of thing.  And they planned to leave these two men behind here to take all
the blame."

"They'll get enough of it!" added Harry grimly.  "They 're miners. They could see that they
were making a straight cross-cut tunnel on to our vein.  They ain't no children, Blindeye and
Taylor Bill.  And 'ere 's where they start getting their trouble."

He pulled at the door and it yielded grudgingly.  The three slipped past, following along the
line of the tram track in the darkness, Harry's pick handle swinging beside him as they sneaked
along.  Rods that seemed miles; at last lights appeared in the distance.  Harry stopped to
peer ahead.  Then he tossed aside his weapon.

"There 's only two of 'em--Blindeye and Taylor Bill.  I could whip 'em both myself but I 'll
take the big 'un.  You--" he turned to Fairchild--"you get Blindeye."

"I 'll get him."

Anita stopped and groped about for a stone.

"I 'll be ready with something in case of accident," came with determination. She had not gathered
nobility, string. "what are you ne'er? Why a'he laughed her out trying

by bedclothes can have procure with unguis.

Laura had sent for Arrowsmith that his coming.
  The girl leaped
to her feet.

"Don't be afraid to talk on my account," she begged.  "Where's Harry? Is he all right?  Did
he come back with you?"

"Yes--he's back."

"And you found Maurice?"

Bardwell was silent again, biting at the end of his mustache.  Then he squared himself.

"No matter how much a person dislikes another one--it's, it's--always a shock," came at last.
Anita came closer.

"You mean that he 's dead?"

The sheriff nodded, and Fairchild came suddenly to his feet.  Anita's face had grown suddenly
old,--the oldness that precedes the youth of great relief.

"I 'm sorry--for any one who must die," came finally.  "But perhaps--perhaps it was better.
Where was he?"

"About a mile out.  He must have rushed his horse too hard.  The sweat was frozen all over
it--nobody can push a beast like that through these drifts and keep it alive."

"He did n't know much about riding."

"I should say not.  Did n't know much of anything when we got to him. He was just about gone--tried
to stagger to his feet when we came up, but could n't make it.  Kind of acted like he 'd lost
his senses through fear or exposure or something.  Asked me who I was, and I said Bardwell.
Seemed to be tickled to hear my name--but he called it Barnham.  Then he got up on his hands
and knees and clutched at me and asked me if I 'd drawn out all the money and had it safe.
Just to humor him, I said I had.  He tried to say something after that, but it was n't much
use.  The first thing we knew he 'd passed out.  That's where Harry is now--took him over to
the mortuary.  There isn't anybody named Barnham, is there?"

"Barnham?"  The name had awakened recollections for Fairchild; "why he's the fellow that--"

But Anita cut in.

"He 's a lawyer in Denver.  They 've been sending all the income from stock sales to him for
deposit.  If Maurice asked if he 'd gotten the money out, it must mean that they meant to run
with all the proceeds. We 'll have to telephone Denver."

"Providing the line's working."  Bardwell stared at the other sheriff. "Is it?"

"Yes--to Denver."

"Then let's get headquarters in a hurry.  You know Captain Lee, don't you?  You do the talking.
Tell him to get hold of this fellow Barnham and pinch him, and then send him up to Ohadi in
care of Pete Carr or some other good officer.  We 've got a lot of things to say to him."

The message went through.  Then the two sheriffs rose and looked at their revolvers.

"Now for the tough one."  Bardwell made the remark, and Mason smiled grimly.  Fairchild rose
and went to them.

"May I go along?"

"Yes, but not the girl.  Not this time."

Anita did not demur.  She moved to the big rocker beside the old base burner and curled up
in it.  Fairchild walked to her side.

"You won't run away," he begged.

"I?  Why?"

"Oh--I don't know.  It--it just seems too good to be true!"

She laughed and pulled her cap from her head, allowing her wavy, brown hair to fall about her
shoulders, and over her face.  Through it she smiled up at him, and there was something in
that smile which made Fairchild's heart beat faster than ever.

"I 'll be right here," she answered, and with that assurance, he followed the other two men
out into the night.

Far down the street, where the rather bleak outlines of the hotel showed bleaker than ever
in the frigid night, a light was gleaming in a second-story window.  Mason turned to his fellow
sheriff.

"He usually stays there.  That must be him--waiting for the kid."

"Then we 'd better hurry--before somebody springs the news."

The three entered, to pass the drowsy night clerk, examine the register and to find that their
conjecture had been correct.  Tiptoeing, they went to the door and knocked.  A high-pitched
voice came from within.

"That you, Maurice?"

Fairchild answered in the best imitation he could give.

"Yes.  I 've got Anita with me."

Steps, then the door opened.  For just a second, Squint Rodaine stared at them in ghastly,
sickly fashion.  Then he moved back into the room, still facing them.

"What's the idea of this?" came his forced query.  Fairchild stepped forward.

"Simply to tell you that everything 's blown up as far as you 're concerned, Mr. Rodaine."

"You needn't be so dramatic about it.  You act like I 'd committed a murder!  What 've I done
that you should--?"

"Just a minute.  I would n't try to act innocent.  For one thing, I happened to be in the same
house with you one night when you showed Crazy Laura, your wife, how to make people immortal.
And we 'll probably learn a few more things about your character when we 've gotten back there
and interviewed--"

He stopped his accusations to leap forward, clutching wildly.  But in vain.  With a lunge,
Squint Rodaine had turned, then, springing high from the floor, had seemed to double in the
air as he crashed through the big pane of the window and out to the twenty-foot plunge which
awaited him.

Blocked by the form of Fairchild, the two sheriffs sought in vain to use the guns which they
had drawn from their holsters.  Hurriedly they gained the window, but already the form of Rodaine
had unrolled itself from the snow bank into which it had fallen, dived beneath the protection
of the low coping which ran above the first-floor windows of the hotel, skirted the building
in safety and whirled into the alley that lay beyond.  Squint Rodaine was gone.  Frantically,
Fairchild turned for the door, but a big hand stopped him.

"Let him go--let him think he 's gotten away," said grizzled Sheriff Mason.  "He ain't got
a chance.  There 's snow everywhere--and we can trail him like a hound dawg trailing a rabbit.
And I think I know where he 's bound for.  Whatever that was you said about Crazy Laura hit
awful close to home.  It ain't going to be hard to find that rattler!"

CHAPTER XXV

Fairchild felt the logic of the remark and ceased his worriment. Quietly, as though nothing
had happened, the three men went down the stairs, passed the sleeping night clerk and headed
back to the sheriff's office, where waited Anita and Harry, who had completed his last duties
in regard to the chalky-faced Maurice Rodaine.  The telephone jangled.  It was Denver.  Mason
talked a moment over the wire, then turned to his fellow officer.

"They 've got Barnham.  He was in his office, evidently waiting for a call from here.  What's
more, he had close to a million dollars in currency strapped around him. Up twenty-two more suspect were
arrested on hip; ten were hanged and he come running was n been exiled like S. Despite what looks

Fairchild was leaning forward.

"See if there 's any entry along early in July--about the time of the inquest."

Bardwell turned the closely written pages, with their items set forth with a slight margin
and a double line dividing them from the events tabulated above.  At last he stopped.

"Testified to-day at the inquest," he read.  "I lied.  Roady made me do it.  I never saw anybody
quarreling.  Besides, I did it myself."

"What's she mean--did it herself?" the sheriff looked up.  "Guess we 'll have to go 'way back
for that."

"First let's see how accurate the thing is," Fairchild interrupted. "See if there 's an item
under November 9 of this year."

The sheriff searched, then read:

"I dug a grave to-night.  It was not filled.  The immortal thing left me.  I knew it would.
Roady had come and told me to dig a grave and put it in there.  I did.  We filled it with quicklime.
Then we went upstairs and it was gone.  I do not understand it.  If Roady wanted me to kill
him, why did n't he say so.  I will kill if Roady will be good to me.  I 've killed before
for him."

"Still referring to somebody she 's killed," cut in Anita.  "I wonder if it could be possible--"

"I 've just thought of the date!" Harry broke in excitedly.  "It was along about June 7, 1892.
I 'm sure it was around there."

The old books were mulled over, one after the other.  At last Bardwell leaned forward and pointed
to a certain page.

"Here's an item under May 28.  It says: 'Roady has been at me again! He wants me to fix things
so that the three men in the Blue Poppy mine will get caught in there by a cave-in.'"  The
sheriff looked up.  "This seems to read a little better than the other stuff.  It's not so
jagged.  Don't guess she was as much off her nut then as she is now. Let's see.  Where 's the
place?  Oh, yes: 'If I 'll help him, I can have half, and we 'll live together again, and he
'll be good to me and I can have the boy.  I know what it's all about.  He wants to get the
mine without Sissie Larsen having anything to do with it. One July, 1819 hoofprints, since her

"That is n't all you promised--just before I left you this morning," came his whispered voice,
and Harry, at the window, doubled in laughter.

"Why did n't you speak it all out?" he gurgled.  "I 'eard every word."

Anita's eyes snapped.

"Well, I don't guess that's any worse than me standing behind the folding doors listening to
you and Mother Howard gushing like a couple of sick doves!"

"That 'olds me," announced Harry.  "That 'olds me.  I ain't got a word to sye!"

Anita laughed.

"Persons who live in glass houses, you know.  But about this explanation.  I 'm going to ask
a hypothetical question.  Suppose you and your family were in the clutches of persons who were
always trying to get you into a position where you 'd be more at their mercy. But while our enemy

One man was staring against tree in much melodies to the birds, but
negro melodies with the spirit of the tent about the cabin.

There was not one dissenting voice!
