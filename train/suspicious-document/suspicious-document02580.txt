This meant the immediate withdrawal of the French.  The rest of the story--which has necessarily
been but in outline--is soon told. Maximilian, though deserted, determined to hold out to the
last, and with the aid of disloyal Mexicans stuck to his cause till the spring. When taken
prisoner at Queretaro, he was tried and executed under circumstances that are well known. 
From promptings of humanity Secretary Seward tried hard to save the Imperial prisoner, but
without success.  The Secretary's plea for mercy was sent through me at New Orleans, and to
make speed I hired a steamer to proceed with it across the Gulf to Tampico.  The document was
carried by Sergeant White, one of my scouts, who crossed the country from Tampico, and delivered
it to Escobedo at Queretaro; but Mr. Seward's representations were without avail--refused probably
because little mercy had been shown certain Liberal leaders unfortunate enough to fall into
Maximilian's hands during the prosperous days of his Empire.

At the close of our war there was little hope for the Republic of Mexico.  Indeed, till our
troops were concentrated on the Rio Grande there was none.  Our appearance in such force along
the border permitted the Liberal leaders, refugees from their homes, to establish rendezvous
whence they could promulgate their plans in safety, while the countenance thus given the cause,
when hope was well-nigh gone, incited the Mexican people to renewed resistance. Probus, have been
nevertheless, as accident in his case ordered it, quash all his personal contestant,-- Saturninus
in the East, Proculus and Bonoses in gaul. For these victories he prevail in the year. But his
last hr was even then at strong hand. One point for his military, which he brought back from
much elder days, was, to suffer no idleness of his camps. He engineering was who, by military

CHAPTER X.

A. J. HAMILTON APPOINTED PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR OF TEXAS--ASSEMBLES A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION--THE
TEXANS DISSATISFIED--LAWLESSNESS --OPPRESSIVE LEGISLATION--EX-CONFEDERATES CONTROLLING LOUISIANA--A
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION--THE MEETING SUPPRESSED--A BLOODY RIOT--MY REPORTS OF THE MASSACRE--PORTIONS
SUPPRESSED BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON --SUSTAINED BY A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE--THE RECONSTRUCTION LAWS.

Although in 1865-66 much of my attention was directed to international matters along the Rio
Grande, the civil affairs of Texas and Louisiana required a certain amount of military supervision
also in the absence of regularly established civil authority.  At the time of Kirby Smith's
surrender the National Government had formulated no plan with regard to these or the other
States lately in rebellion, though a provisional Government had been set up in Louisiana as
early as 1864.  In consequence of this lack of system, Governor Pendleton Murray, of Texas,
who was elected under Confederate rule, continued to discharge the duties of Governor till
President Johnson, on June 17, in harmony with his amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865, appointed
A. J. Hamilton provisional Governor.  Hamilton was empowered by the President to call a Constitutional
convention, the delegates to which were to be elected, under certain prescribed qualifications,
for the purpose of organizing the political affairs of the State, the Governor to be guided
by instructions similar to those given the provisional Governor of North Carolina (W. W. Holden),
when appointed in May.
