The Mate of the Lily; Notes from Harry Musgrave's Log Book, by W H G Kingston.

This is another book by Kingston on the theme of a youngster whose father has not returned
from a voyage at sea, and whose mother therefore is almost destitute, with several younger
children to house and feed. Luckily her brother Jack, the Mate of the Lily, is home, and though
pledged in marriage, offers to provide for the family, taking the eldest, Harry, with him as
an apprentice officer.  They are to look for a return cargo in the Java Seas and thereabouts,
and use the opportunity, following certain clues, to search for Captain Musgrave and his vessel.

There are all sorts of vicissitudes, from storm, volcanoes, grounding, and persistent attacks
by the pirates that infest those seas.

Needless to say they find him, though practically at the end of his life, from despair.  On
being found he recovers his spirits, and so is brought home.

It is well-written, and full of suspense.  There are other twists to the story that I have
not mentioned above, and I am sure you would enjoy reading the book or listening to it.

CHAPTER ONE.

Jack Radburn, mate of the "Lily," was as prime a seaman as ever broke biscuit.  Brave, generous,
and true, so said all the crew, as did also Captain Haiselden, with whom he had sailed since
he had first been to sea.  Yet so modest and gentle was he on shore that, in spite of his broad
shoulders and sun-burnt brow, landsmen were apt to declare that "butter wouldn't melt in his
mouth."

A finer brig than the "Lily" never sailed from the port of London.  Well built and well found--many
a successful voyage had she made to far distant seas.  Jack Radburn might have got command
of a larger craft, but Captain Haiselden, who had nursed him through a fever caught on the
coast of Africa, and whose life on another occasion he had saved, thus closely cementing their
friendship, begged him to remain with him for yet another voyage, likely to be the most adventurous
they had ever yet undertaken.

Jack Radburn, who was my uncle, stayed when on shore--not often many weeks together--with his
sister, Mrs Musgrave, my mother.

Though he was my uncle, I have spoken of him as Jack Radburn, mate of the "Lily," as did everybody
else; indeed, he was, I may say, as well known as the captain himself.  My mother, who was
the daughter of a clergyman long since dead, had not many acquaintances.  She had been left
by my grandfather with little or nothing to depend upon, when her brother introduced to her
my father, then first mate of the ship to which he belonged.

Her greatest friend was Grace Bingley, who lived with her mother, wife of a ship-master, a
few doors off from us.

Uncle Jack had consequently seen much of Grace Bingley, and had given her the whole of his
warm honest heart, nor was it surprising that he had received hers in return, and pretty tightly
he held it too.  Even my mother acknowledged that she was worthy of him, for a sweeter or more
right-minded girl was not, far or near, to be found.

Some four years before the time of which I am now speaking, my father sailed in command of
a fine ship, the "Amphion," for the Eastern seas. The time we had expected him to return had
long passed away.  My mother did not, however, give up all expectation of seeing him, but day
after day and week after week we looked for him in vain.  The owners at last wrote word that
they feared the ship had been lost in a typhoon, but yet it was possible that she might have
been cast away on some uninhabited island from whence the crew could not effect their escape.
My mother therefore still hoped on and endeavoured to eke out her means so as to retain her
house that my father might find a home should he return.

I was setting off with Uncle Jack for the "Lily," which was undergoing a thorough repair, and
he seldom failed to pay her one or two visits in the day to see how things were going on, when
two seamen came rolling up the street towards us in sailor fashion, and looking, it seemed
to me, as if they had been drinking, though they may not have been exactly drunk.  As they
approached one nudged the other, and, looking at Uncle Jack, exchanged a few words.

They would have passed us, when he, having noticed this, hailed them--

"What cheer, my hearties, have we ever sailed together?"

"Can't say exactly, sir, for we've knocked about at sea so long that it's hard to mind all
the officers we've served under.  But now I looks at you, sir, I think you used to come aboard
the `Amphion' before she left Old England.  We heard say you were the captain's brother."

"The `Amphion!'" exclaimed Uncle Jack, eagerly, looking hard at the men. "Can you give me any
news of her?"

"Aye, sir, but it's bad news."

"Out with it, whatever it is," exclaimed Uncle Jack, fixing his eyes on the man, to judge whether
he spoke the truth.

"It's a matter of over four years gone by when we sailed for the Eastern seas.  We had been
knocking about in them parts for some months, when we were caught in a regular hurricane, which
carried away our topmasts and mainyard, and did other damage.  At the same time we sprang a
leak, and had to keep the pumps going without a moment's rest.  When night came on, and a terrible
dark night it was, sir, matters grew worse and worse, not a hope but that the ship would go
down, though we well-nigh worked our arms off to keep her afloat.  Howsomedever before long,
she struck on a reef, though she hadn't been thrashing away on it three minutes when she drove
off, and the water came rushing in like a mill stream. `Out boats,' was the cry.  Bill here
and I, with three others, got into the jolly-boat, but before another soul could spring aboard
her she drifted away from the ship.  We felt about, and found a lugsail and an oar.  To go
back was more than we could do, and it's our belief that scarcely had we left her than the
ship went down. I was laid to like a must be sky did not despatch i was distressed. Board did not

Julian was

"There's that bird making another swoop!" he exclaimed, and soon afterwards he cried out, "He
has risen again.  Give way, lads!  He may not have struck both."

I did give way as may be supposed.  If one had been struck, might it not have been Uncle Jack!

"He has hold of the grating at last!" cried the mate.  "I see him waving his hand.  There comes
the bird again!"

Once more my heart sank within me.  I could not turn round to look, or I might have missed
my stroke.  The boat seemed to be making but fearfully slow progress as I watched the brig
rising to the seas, and as she pitched into them, throwing the spray over her bows.  There
stood the captain pointing with his hand, as if to encourage us to persevere.  On and on we
pulled, I expecting every moment to hear the mate exclaim that the albatross had made a fatal
swoop.  At last I heard a voice, though a very weak one, cry, "Take the boy in first."

I knew it was that of Uncle Jack; I saw him lift little Jem up while he held on to the gunwale.
The two men in the bow then hauled him in, and next the grating on which he had supported himself.

Uncle Jack sank down utterly exhausted.  We passed the boy aft.  He seemed to be dead.  We
then dragged the first mate into the stern-sheets, but could not attend to him, for we were
compelled to keep our oars going to get the boat round as soon as possible.  Uncle Jack lay
without moving.  I saw that one of his shoes was off.  He presently came to.  His first thought
was for the boy, whose hands and chest he began to chafe as well as his weakness would allow.

The second mate, I thought, might have spared a hand to help him, but he looked on, it seemed
to me, with indifference, jealous that the first mate should have behaved so gallantly, or--although
I tried to put the thought from me--angry that he had escaped.  We pulled away until rounding
the stern of the brig, we got alongside, when a cheer burst from the crew as they saw that
we had the first mate and little Jem safe.  Eager hands stood by to lift them or board, for
even Uncle Jack was still too weak to help himself.  While the boat was being hoisted up the
captain directed Mr Blyth and me to carry the boy into his own cabin, he and two of the men
following with the first mate, who was placed in his own berth.  We, in the meantime, had got
the boy's clothes off him and had wrapped him up in a dry blanket, while we kept chafing his
chest, arms, and feet until he breathed freely.  He soon returned to consciousness, and looking
about him was much surprised to find where he was.

"Where's Mr Radburn?  Oh, sir, have you got him safe?" was his first question.

He is all right, my lad.

"It's that bird, sir; it's that bird, sir!  Oh, save me from it!" he continued crying out.

"The bird won't hurt you, and Mr Radburn is safe in his cabin, I hope," answered Mr Blyth,
in a kind voice.

As soon as I could I went to see how the first mate was getting on.  He had swallowed a cup
of hot tea, for we were just going to breakfast, and this had greatly restored him; and though
the captain had advised him to be still, he was putting on his dry clothes, and in a short
time joined us at table.

Uncle Jack said that he had felt the tips of the bird's wing pass over his head each time that
it swooped down, but that he had taken off his shoe and attempted to defend himself, until
the bird had seized upon it and carried it off.  "It will find the shoe a tough morsel to digest,"
he added, laughing; "but truly I have reason to thank God that it did not strike either little
Jem or me with its sharp beak, and I was so exhausted that if the boat hadn't come up when
she did, I should have been unable to keep him longer at bay."

Either Mr Blyth or I stayed by "Little Jem" all day, the captain and first mate every now and
then looking in.  By night he was well enough to be removed to his own berth forward, where
the men promised to look after him.

The captain and Mr Blyth complimented the first mate on his gallant conduct, but he seemed
to think he had done nothing out of the way.

"There is one thing a man should consider before he jumps overboard, and that is, whether there
is too much sea on to allow of a boat being lowered, for if there is he will not only lose
his own life, but cause the loss of others," observed the captain.  "It is a hard matter, however,
to lay down a rule.  Still it is very certain that we should do our best to save the lives
of our fellow-creatures."

We once sighted an island, which I believe was one of the Crozet group. In rather over three
months we entered the Straits of Sunda, when, as we were approaching shores the inhabitants
of which were addicted to piracy, we got up our guns from the hold and mounted them, and overhauled
our firearms.  Before long we had a good chance of requiring them, for when running through
the Straits of Banca, between that island and Sumatra--while nearly becalmed--we made out three
large prahus full of people, pulling towards us.  Whether their intentions were friendly or
the reverse we could not ascertain, but we certainly did not like their looks; a breeze, however,
sprang up and we stood on our course. Soon afterwards we came in sight of the fine town of
Singapore, founded in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, who made it a free port.  At that period
a wretched village stood on its site, the neighbouring harbour being the rendezvous only of
a few trading prahus.  It is now a magnificent city, and upwards of a thousand square-rigged
vessels anchor annually in the roads.  On the hills beyond it can be seen the residences of
the merchants, surrounded by plantations of spice-trees, while excellent roads with bridges
over the streams run in all directions.

Besides English churches and chapels, there are Chinese Joss houses, Hindoo temples, and Mohammedan
mosques, while large numbers of Chinese and Malay cottages form the suburbs.  The Chinese are
here seen in considerable numbers, being the most industrious part of the population, and include
many wealthy merchants.  There are Klings from Western India; Arabs, chiefly shop-keepers;
Parsee merchants; Bengalese, mostly grooms and washmen; Japanese sailors, many of whom are
also domestic servants; Portuguese clerks, and traders from Celebes, Boli, and other islands
of the vast archipelago.

Having discharged part of our cargo, we took on board such articles as we heard were in demand
among the natives with whom we hoped to open up a trade.  In the interval Mr Blyth proposed
that he and I should make a trip into the interior.  We could not, however, go far, for the
island is only about twenty-seven miles in length and eleven in breadth.  We were particularly
warned not to venture into the forest, as we should run a great risk of being carried off by
tigers, large numbers of which infest the jungles, and, it is said, kill a Chinaman a day,
they being the chief workers in the plantations.  The captain gave me leave to accompany the
supercargo, and we hired two small Timor ponies for our excursion.  We had not got far when
we met a party of men carrying between them the skin of a large tiger, propped up on a sort
of platform formed of bamboos, looking very fierce, with its mouth open and tail on end.  They
were on their way to the government office to receive the reward given for every animal killed,
just as payment was made in former years in England for the head of each wolf put out of existence.
The animal had been caught in a pit covered over with sticks and leaves, the usual mode in
which they are trapped.  We kept a sharp look-out, with our pistols ready to shoot a tiger
should one attack us.  We heard several roars, and a huge beast crossed the road in front of
us.  After this we did not feel altogether comfortable, expecting every moment that it would
spring out from the jungle and carry off one or both of us.

We returned to the city, however, without an actual encounter.  I cannot stop further to describe
this interesting place.  In a few days we sailed for George Town on the eastern side of the
island of Penang, the seat of Government of the British possessions in the Straits of Malacca,
Penang is larger than Singapore, a considerable portion being rocky, and those most industrious
of mortals, the Chinese, form the chief part of the population.  After discharging the cargo
we had brought from England for this place, we again sailed, steering through the straits of
Singapore for the eastward.

CHAPTER TWO.

We were bound for Kuching, the capital town of the province of Sarawak in Borneo, where Mr
Brooke, who went out in 1839 in his yacht the "Royalist," had, by his judgment and intrepidity,
established a thriving community, of which he had been appointed the chief or rajah.  The captain
and supercargo had mapped out our future course.  This was to be along the north coast of Borneo,
through the Sooloo archipelago, across the sea of Celebes to the coast of Papua, and thence
through the Banda sea to Timor, whence we were to return home along the southern coast of Java.
It took two days to get up to Kuching, the capital of the province of Sarawak, after we had
entered the mouth of the river on the banks of which it stands.  On either side were hills
covered with jungle, with here and there clearings where the peaceably-disposed natives had
established themselves.

Mr Blyth and I had an opportunity, in company with a gentleman who was making a shooting expedition,
of taking a trip into the interior.  I wish that I could describe the magnificent vegetation,
the gigantic trees, and the curious animals we saw.  One of the most curious was the mias.
What is a mias? will be asked.  It is the native name of the far-famed ourang-outang, the principal
wild inhabitants of this region. We were proceeding through the forest, with our guns, when
one of our Dyak companions came running up to tell us that he had seen a mias, and that if
we made haste we might be in time to shoot it.

We hurried on, the Dyak leading the way, until we entered a thick jungle.  He pointed to a
tree far above our heads.  Upon looking up we saw a great hairy body and a huge black face
gazing down upon us, as if wondering what strange creatures we could be.  Mr Blyth and our
friend fired; whether they had hit the mias we could not tell, but it began to move away among
the higher branches at a rapid rate.  Led by the Dyak we followed, when again we caught sight
of it on the branch of a tree, where it remained for a minute or more.  By this time we were
joined by several other Dyaks, whose shouts appeared to frighten the ourang-outang, which tried
to get along the edge of the forest by some lower trees, keeping, however, beyond the reach
of our rifles.  The Dyaks, flourishing their weapons, rushed on ahead of us hoping to have
the honour of killing the monster.  We had lost sight of them for a few seconds, when we heard
fearful shrieks and shouts, and running forward, we saw that the mias had either voluntarily
descended the tree, or had fallen to the ground, and had rushed at one of the natives, who,
unable to escape, was standing with his spear ready to defend himself.  We were afraid in attempting
to kill the mias that we might shoot the native, when, just as the creature was about to seize
the man with its mouth and formidable claws, our friend fired and the animal fell, shot through
the heart.

On measuring the mias, from the top of its head to its heel, we found that it was four feet
two inches long, while its outstretched arms measured seven feet three inches across.  Its
head and body were of the size of a man's, the legs being very short in proportion.  This mias
was of the larger species, many being under four feet high, and some of the females not more
than three feet six inches.

We saw a frog, with large web feet and inflated body, fly from the top of a tall tree.  It
was about four inches long, the back and limbs of a shining black hue, with yellow beneath.
Our friend had promised us a rich treat at supper, and he produced a fruit which he told us
was the Durian.  It was of the size of a large cocoa-nut, the husk of a green colour, and covered
all over with short stout spines.  It grows on a lofty tree, somewhat resembling the elm. 
It falls immediately it is ripe; but the outer rind is so tough that it is never broken by
the fall.  There are marks which show where it may be divided into five portions; these are
of a satin whiteness, and each one is filled with an oval mass of cream-coloured pulp, in which
are two or three seeds about the size of chestnuts.  This pulp is the eatable part.  Its consistency
is that of a rich custard.  As to describing its taste, that is more than I can do.  It is
not acid, nor is it sweet, nor juicy, but yet, as we ate it, we agreed that none of these qualities
were wanting, and that it was the most delicious fruit we had ever met with.  The Mangosteen,
which comes to perfection in Borneo, is another splendid fruit of a sub-acid flavour, better
known than the Durian.  But I must not stop to give long descriptions either of the animals
or fruits we met with. Blyth and I had to return, as we could not long be absent from the brig.

Often had the now smiling plantations through which we passed been plundered by blood-thirsty
pirates, and the heads of their inhabitants carried off.  A visitor on board gave us dreadful
accounts of the atrocities committed by the pirates in the seas through which we were to sail.

"We will show them that they had better not attack us," observed Captain Haiselden, pointing
to our guns.  "The `Lily' is a match for all their fleets put together."

"Not if the `Lily' is caught at anchor or in a calm; you may then find that they are too much
for her," was the answer.  "These prahus often carry sixty men or more, with guns and small
arms, and you would find it no easy matter, were you to be attacked, to beat them off."

"They'll not stop us; but we will keep a bright look-out for them," answered Captain Haiselden.

We had a fine breeze as we ran along the coast of Borneo, and although we saw in the distance
not a few long suspicious-looking prahus, we sailed too fast for them to overtake us.  We saw
one of these crafts lately captured, which had been brought to Kuching.  She was about ninety
feet in length, and of proportionate beam.  In the bow she carried a long twelve-pounder gun,
and six swivels on each broadside, besides which she had thirty or forty rifles or muskets
on board, and other small arms, swords, pistols, and pikes.  This deck served as a platform,
on which the fighting men stand to fire their muskets or hurl their spears, while the rowers
below them sit cross-legged on a shelf projecting outwards from the bends of the vessel.

The Dyak piratical vessels are called "Bang Kongs."  Although they are a hundred feet in length
by ten in beam, they draw but little water, and are both light and faster than the Malay prahus.
They have long overhanging stems and sterns, are propelled by eighty paddles, and are as swift
as any craft afloat.  Some mount a few small swivels, and each carries a certain number of
Malays armed with muskets, besides which they have their regular crew of Dyaks, whose weapons
are spears.  From drawing so little water they are much dreaded, as they can run up the shallowest
river, when their savage crews, landing, commit most horrible atrocities on the inhabitants
living near the banks.

We had left Sarawak about three days, when it fell almost calm; still the vessel was making
some way through the water.  I was stationed forward to keep a look-out.  As I turned my eyes
around the horizon ahead I fancied that I could distinguish what appeared just like a small
number of black dots rising above it.  Before I sang out, however, asking the boatswain, who
had come on the forecastle to take my place, I ran aloft, with a spy-glass slung to my back,
to satisfy myself whether I was right or not.  Reaching the fore-topmast cross-trees, I took
a steady look in the direction I had seen the dots I was convinced that they were prahus, though
whether large or small I could not be certain, pulling towards the coast of Borneo.  I counted
six altogether.  On my return I went aft to report what I had seen to the captain.

"We will keep away a little, and pass astern of them.  They may possibly not have seen us,
or if they have, they'll think it prudent not to come nearer."

The first mate on hearing my report also went aloft, and on his return corroborated it.  I
confess that I felt somewhat uneasy at the sight of these vessels.  They might be peaceable
traders, but they might be pirates, who, should they find us becalmed, might try to obtain
a rich booty such as our vessel would afford them.

I was surprised that my uncle and the captain took the matter so coolly. I watched the strangers
until they were no longer to be seen from the deck.  After some time we again hauled up and
stood on our course to the eastward.  Later in the day, on going aloft, I again caught sight
of the prahus, as I believed them to be, but as they were very low in the water, they were
scarcely visible to any but a sharp pair of eyes, such as I possessed.

In the afternoon I was taking a turn on deck with Mr Blyth, the captain and first mate being
below, and the third mate in charge of the brig, when I observed a small cloud coming up on
the port bow.

"There's wind in that cloud, I'm sure," I said to my companion.  "I'll point it out to the
mate, for he doesn't seem to see it."  I did so.

"That's all you know about the matter, youngster," he answered in a scornful tone.

"We shall be taken aback if we don't shorten sail, and I don't know what will happen," I remarked
to Blyth, when I rejoined him.  "I have a good mind to run down and tell the first mate."

Scarcely had I said this, and was about to spring down the companion-hatch, when Mr Ling sang out--

"Ready, about ship!"

The helm was put down, the yards were being braced round, and the brig's head brought to the
wind, when, as I looked up, I saw every sail aback. At that moment I heard the voice of the
captain, who had just come on deck, shouting, "All hands shorten sail and save ship," but the
order was given too late.  The squall I had seen coming up just then struck her, and in one
moment, with a fearful crash, the main-mast fell.  I should have been crushed had I not by
tumbling head first down the hatchway avoided it; the next instant the foremast followed, and
the bob-stays giving way, dragged the bowsprit on board.  The moment the crash was heard the
first mate sprang up the companion-ladder shooting me with his head on deck again.  I looked
round expecting to see many of the crew killed.  My eye first fell on Mr Blyth, who was holding
on by a stanchion, and apparently uninjured.  The second mate, too, excepting a blow on the
shoulder, had escaped, while of the crew, though they looked very much astonished, not a man
was seriously hurt.  Several of them, indeed, who had been below, had only rushed up on hearing
the crash of the falling masts.  They were gazing with open eyes on the utterly dismantled
state of the brig, lately so taunt and trim, waiting for the captain's orders what to do. 
But what had become of him?  He was nowhere to be seen.  At first I feared that he had been
knocked overboard, but as I looked about I caught sight of a man's legs sticking out from under
a mass of sails and rigging.  Knowing that it must be the captain, I ran to drag him out, calling
on Blyth to assist me.

We soon got him free, but he did not move; we feared that he was dead. At Blyth's suggestion,
with the help of two of the men, we carried him below and placed him on his bed.

Greatly to our relief he in a short time began to show signs of life.

"He will soon come round," said Blyth; "I will watch him, so do you go on deck, Harry, where
I am sure you will be wanted, and tell the first mate how he is getting on."

I hurried up, and reported the captain's state to my uncle.

"Thank heaven!" he exclaimed; "I had no wish to take his place, but I must attend to the work
before us--we have plenty of it."

He then turned round to the bewildered crew--

"We must first haul in all the gear trailing overboard, my lads, and then get up jury-masts,"
he shouted out, hurrying along the deck to examine the state of things forward.

Having got the spars and rigging on board, we commenced unbending the sails and unreefing and
coiling away the ropes.  As we got the yards free we stowed them amidships, that we might use
those of them which were most suitable for jury-masts.  The wind had in the meantime been increasing,
and the sea was getting up.  All we could do was to keep the vessel before it, while we laboured
hard to rig a jury-mast forward that we might, as soon as possible, get sail on the brig to
steady her.  She was now rolling fearfully, and it was with difficulty even that we could keep
our feet.  I looked out more than once in the direction where I had seen the prahus, fearing
that should they discover our present defenceless condition they might attack us, for although
we might fight our guns it would be at a great disadvantage.

The gale blew harder and harder.  I had not heard for what port the first mate intended to
steer, though I of course knew that he would endeavour to make one as soon as possible, either
Sarawak or Singapore; but as the gale was at present blowing us away from both of them until
we could get up jury-masts and haul our wind it would be impossible to reach either the one
or the other.  There were numerous dangers in the way which would at all events have to be
encountered.

We were moving sluggishly on amid the fast rising seas, when I saw an object in the water,
still at a considerable distance ahead.  Now it appeared on the summit of a sea, now it sank
into a hollow.  It looked so much like the wreck of a vessel that I reported it to the first mate.

"Maybe some unfortunate craft capsized by the squall, a fate which might have been ours had
not the masts given way," he observed.  "We'll endeavour to keep close to her in case any of
the crew may have escaped and be clinging to the wreck."

As we got nearer I jumped up on the forecastle, when I saw that the object was a vessel of
some sort, but not an European craft.  She was a prahu, probably one of the fleet we had before
seen.  In a short time I perceived that there was some one on board clinging to the stern,
which was the highest part out of water.

I at once told the first mate.  He and the second mate held a short consultation as to the
best means of rescuing the person--pirate as he might be, we could not leave him to perish.

Some spars had been lashed to the stump of the foremast on which a royal had been set, and
this enabled us to have the brig somewhat under command.  Ropes were got ready to heave to
the man.  The boatswain, who took the helm, steered the vessel so as to pass close to the wreck
without the danger of running her down.  Immediately the brig's side touched her a rope was
hove to the man, who was standing up ready to catch it.

"Haul away!" he shouted, as he clutched it firmly, and several willing hands being ready to
haul him in.  The next instant he was on board the brig, while the wreck, bounding off from
us, dropped aft, about, it seemed, to plunge beneath the foaming seas.

"Why, my lad, who are you?" asked the first mate, who had assisted him on board.

"I am an Englishman," was the answer of the stranger, but he in vain tried to say more.

"Though you are pretty well sun-burnt, you have an Englishman's face sure enough, though you
seem to have lost the use of your tongue."

"Long, long time no talk English," replied the man, who seemed to understand pretty clearly
what was said to him.  We had too much to do, however, to spend time in asking him questions.

Before night we had some spars lashed to the stump of the main-mast, which enabled us to set
a little after sail and bring the vessel to.

It was of the greatest importance not to run further eastward.  Happily the wind shifted, and
getting the vessel's head round we steered for Singapore.  The gale, too, began to abate, and
the sea to go down, so that we were able to carry on our work with less difficulty than had
before been the case.  The dangers in our course were numerous, but we hoped, by constant vigilance,
to avoid them.

CHAPTER THREE.

We had an anxious time of it as we made our way back to Singapore, between islands innumerable
and coral reefs below water, on which it was often with difficulty we avoided running.  The
first mate was seldom off the deck, and Crowfoot, the boatswain, showed that he did not boast
without justice of his seamanship.

It is on such occasions that a sailor has an opportunity of proving what he is made of.  The
wind continued fair and the weather fine, or our difficulties would have been greatly increased.
The less I say of the second mate the better.  Uncle Jack did not trust him, and while it was
his watch on deck constantly sent me up, or made an excuse for running up himself to see how
matters were going on.  He insisted also on taking his share in attending on our poor captain,
who remained in his berth unable to move, and, as we feared, in a very precarious state.  Blyth
and I assisted in nursing him, but the second mate, through whose carelessness the brig had
been dismasted and the captain injured, refused to take the slightest trouble to help us--indeed,
he kept out of the cabin altogether.  The young man we had rescued from the Malay prahu gradually
regained his recollection of English, but from the first he showed an unwillingness to talk
about himself, and I observed that he kept aloof as much as possible from the crew.  When I
asked his name he said it was Ned Light, that he had been wrecked somewhere to the eastward,
and, narrowly escaping with his life, had been taken prisoner by the pirates, who had kept
him ever since in bondage.  He appeared to be more ready to talk to little Jem than to any
one else, and the two were constantly together.  When I tried to find out from the boy what
account Ned gave of himself, Jem was remarkably reticent.  At length, however, one day he said,
"He seems to be afraid of some of the men, sir.  He thinks that they intend to do him harm,
but I cannot find out why he has got that idea into his head.  I told him that he might trust
you and the first mate, but he only answers, `Better not talk.'"

All had gone well in consequence of the constant watchfulness and untiring efforts of the first
mate, when, as we were within about four days' sail of our destination, while rigging out a
boom on which to set a square sail, one of our best hands, Dick Mason, fell overboard.  The
brig was running about four knots through the water, and as Mason could swim well, no one felt
much apprehension about his safety.  The sails were instantly clewed up, and the only boat
which had escaped injury was at once lowered.  Ned and I, with Crowfoot, the boatswain, and
two other hands jumped into her and pulled away towards our shipmate, who was striking out
boldly to meet us.  Before the boat was lowered, however, the brig had run some distance, and
we had a considerable way to go. Just as I was going down the side I saw a black fin rising
above the surface, passing close under the stern.  The boatswain I knew had seen it too, for
he urged us to use our utmost exertions to reach Mason, and sang out to him to keep splashing
about with all his might.  We did our best, making the oars bend again.  We were within half
a cable's length of the poor fellow, when a fearful shriek reached our ears.  I instinctively
turned round just in time to see his head disappear beneath the bright surface.  There was
a ripple where he went down, and as we got up to the spot and looked into the depths of the
ocean we could see a struggling human form surrounded by a ruddy tinge, and the glittering
white of the shark's lower jaws.  Ned, who was in the bows, plunged down his boat-hook, but
Mason's hands were already far below the point he could reach.  The next instant the shark
had disappeared with its prey.

All hope of recovering even the body of our poor shipmate was gone, and we returned with sad
hearts on board.

"He is a great loss to us," remarked the boatswain.  "He was one of the men I could always
trust, and that's more than I can say of some of the rest."

"But Tim Howlett and Trinder are smart hands, surely?"  I observed.

"They may be, but I don't like their goings on.  If others trust them, it's more than I do."

"I am sorry to hear you say that of the men," I remarked.  "I fancied that they were about
the best men we have on board."

"You haven't seen as much of them as I have, or you wouldn't say that of them," replied the
boatswain.

"I'll give a hint to the first mate of what you think," I said.

"No use in doing that.  He generally has his weather eye open, but he's too generous to believe
evil of a man unless he has strong proof.  You must leave him to find the matter out for himself."

At last we sighted the island of Singapore.  Instead, however, of bringing up before the town
we made a signal for three boats, which towed us into the new harbour.  There we came to an
anchor close to the shore, and were able to refit much more rapidly than we could have done
in any other place.  Our crew generally laboured away from sunrise to sunset without complaining.
But Howlett and Trinder grumbled at the additional work they had to perform.  The second mate
seemed always out of humour, and went about his duty in a listless fashion, frequently abusing
the men without any cause for so doing.  The captain, who was getting better, would not allow
himself to be taken on shore to the hospital, asserting that he was much more comfortable on
board with Mr Radburn, Blyth, and me to look after him, than he should be there.  We, however,
persuaded him to let us send for a doctor, who came, and, greatly to our relief, assured us
that he was going on favourably, although it might be a long time before he would be able to
attend to his duty on deck.  The first mate had asked Ned if he would enter in place of Mason,
but he did not--as I thought he would have been glad to do--accept the offer.

I spoke to him, advising him to remain, assuring him that he would be well treated.

"The first mate and boatswain are kind to me, but I think, sir, I had better ship on board
another vessel homeward-bound," he replied.

I asked him, however, to remain a day or two, which he agreed to do. Next morning, when the
hands were mustered for work, Howlett and Trinder were not to be found.  I was sent on shore
to look for them, it being supposed that they were not far off, but after a long search I had
to return on board and say that I could not find them.  There was a creek a little way off
lined with mangrove bushes.  The captain therefore directed Mr Blyth and me to take one of
the boats and pull up it with four hands, all of us well-armed, thinking that the deserters
might have concealed themselves somewhere on its banks, hoping to get an opportunity of making
their way over to Singapore.

We had got a short distance up the creek when I saw a vast number of dark objects hanging to
the bows of the mangrove trees.

"Are those things fruit, or are they the nests of birds?"  I asked, pointing them out to Mr Blyth.

"Neither one nor the other," he answered: "those are bats, or, as they here are called, flying
foxes.  As we return they will be on the move, and you will then see what they are like."

"I will take the present opportunity," I answered, and steering the boat closer in to the shore
I observed that there were thousands and tens of thousands of the creatures hanging by their
claws to the boughs in a most curious manner as thick as a swarm of bees.  With a boat-hook
we pulled off two or three, which falling inboard were picked up.  They showed, however, no
fear, nor did they make any attempt to escape, but licked our hands and appeared perfectly
at ease.  The head was like that of a miniature fox, and the skin was beautifully soft.  Blyth
told me that they live upon fruit, large quantities of which they consume.  On reaching the
head of the creek we found a hut, in or about which it was supposed that the runaways might
have concealed themselves, but we could discover no traces of them, and consequently judged
that it would be useless to search further in that direction.

The dusk of evening had come over as we pulled down the creek, and the bats had begun to stir.
Presently the whole air was filled with them as they took their flight towards the plantations
where they were about to forage.  They looked, with their wings stretched out, of wonderfully
large size, so as literally to darken the sky.

The next day passed and still we could hear nothing of the two men.  The captain on this sent
Blyth and me over to Singapore, where we found that they had entered on board a homeward-bound
ship and had sailed.  With the assistance of the agent we succeeded in replacing them by two
other Englishmen, and we also engaged four Lascars, fine active-looking fellows, who were likely
to prove of much use, as they could endure the heat of the sun better than could our own men.

The captain inquired whether the man we had picked up had entered.

"He has been working very steadily," answered the first mate, "but Harry shall ask him if he
intends to remain."

When the men knocked off work I went forward to speak to him.

"Well, Ned, what have you determined on?"  I asked; "the captain wishes to know whether you
will enter."

"I will very gladly do so, Mr Harry," he answered.  "I like you and the first officer, and
as I have no friends at home who care for me, I am in no hurry to get back to old England."

"Why were you unwilling to enter before?"  I inquired.

"Well, sir, I don't mind telling you now.  It was on account of those two fellows, Howlett
and Trinder.  I have served with them before, and us I know a thing or two about them, and
that they are mutinous, ill-disposed rascals, I was afraid that they would find me out, and
some dark night heave me overboard, or knock me on the head."

"On board what ship did you serve with them?"  I asked.

"On board the `Amphion,'" he answered.  "They and several others of the crew, tarred with the
same brush, stole a boat and deserted from her, leaving us so short-handed that, one of the
officers and two other hands being washed overboard, when the ship caught in a typhoon we were
unable to manage her, and she drove on a reef and was lost, we who remained scarcely escaping
with our lives."

"The `Amphion!'"  I exclaimed, much astonished.  "Why, that was my father's ship!  Did you
say the captain escaped?"

"Yes; all of us, except one poor fellow, got safely on shore, but it was a wild place, and
we found ourselves among savages, who threatened to take our lives, but they did not, though
they ill-treated us, and made us work for them."

"Do you think the captain is still alive?  Can you pilot us to the place?"  I inquired eagerly.

"All I can say is that the captain was well in health, though sadly cast down, when I last
saw him," answered Ned.  "As to finding the spot where we were wrecked, that is what I fear
I cannot do, for I don't know even the name of the country; and as I am ignorant of navigation,
and was soon afterwards carried away by the Malay pirates, who took me about with them from
place to place, I have lost all reckoning, though I calculate that it was somewhere away to
the eastward.  I think, however, that I should know the country if I saw it again, though these
islands are so much like one another that I could not be certain; but do you say, sir, that
you are Captain Musgrave's son?  I have only heard you called Mr Harry, and I did not know
it before, or I should have spoken to you."

"Yes, Captain Musgrave, who commanded the `Amphion,' was my father, and we have long given
him up for lost," I replied.  "Do you think that he remained at the place where the ship was
wrecked, or was he carried off by the pirates?"

"He was not carried off by those who took us, for he and the first mate and two seamen had
gone up the country, and so escaped.  Three others were taken with me, but what became of them
I do not know, may be they were drowned or krissed by the Malays, as I never saw them again;
indeed, it is a wonder that I am alive, seeing what I have gone through. The fellows who first
got hold of me did not keep me long, but sold me to another gang.  They and I were afterwards
wrecked, and when we were trying to make our escape on board some canoes we had built, we were
overtaken by another fleet of pirates, who killed most of my companions. They spared my life,
but sold me after some time to the people to whom the prahu belonged, from the wreck of which
you picked me up."

"You must come aft and narrate what you have told me to the first mate," I said.

I ran down to tell the captain and first mate, who directed me to bring Ned below, that they
might hear his story.  Having cross-questioned him far more than I had done, they were perfectly
satisfied that he had spoken the truth, though they found it impossible to make out where the
`Amphion' had been wrecked.  They put a chart before him, but he was utterly unable to guess
where the wreck had occurred, or even to point out Singapore, where we then were.  Thus we
were left in doubt whether the `Amphion' had been lost on the coast of Borneo or on that of
Celebes or Gillolo, or even as far east as New Guinea.

Ned's account made my uncle and me more eager than ever to continue the voyage.  The captain
fully entered into our feelings, but at the same time he felt that it was his duty to attend
to the interests of the owners, and to visit only the places where trade could be carried on.
The Dutch, who hold possession of Java and many of the Spice Islands to the eastward, throw
so many difficulties in the way of commerce for the sake of keeping it in their own hands,
that the captain had been directed not to visit any of their ports if he could avoid doing
so. Our object therefore was to trade chiefly with the natives, from whom we were more likely
to learn something about the wreck of the "Amphion" than from the Dutch, for it was considered
that if they had had any communication with the survivors of her crew, means would have been
found to send home an account of the occurrence.  Now, as I have said, nothing had been heard
of the "Amphion" when we left England, nearly four years after the time it was supposed she
had been lost, beyond the statement made by the two men who said they had escaped from her.
Ned's account showed that the owners were right in their conjectures as to the possibility
of her having been cast on some desert shore, instead of having gone down, as was more generally
believed, in a typhoon.  By working night and day, we at length got the "Lily" ataunto, and
we were thankful when being towed cut of harbour we found ourselves with a fair wind standing
to the eastward.  We had the same dangers of coral reefs, sand banks, and low islands to encounter
as before, but we were in a better condition now to avoid them.

Having passed the island of Labuan--since taken possession of by the English--on the north-west
of Borneo, we stood along the coast until we rounded the northern end of that large island.
To give some idea of the size of Borneo, I may say that the whole of England, Ireland, and
Scotland, with the Orkney and Shetland Islands, would fit inside it, leaving a very wide margin
all round in addition.  We were talking about the inhabitants, when Uncle Jack observed--

"With the exception of Sarawak in the west, the whole of this magnificent country is in a state
of barbarism.  The few Malay settlements along the coast are but very slightly removed from
the same condition.  It is said that the chief delight of the Dyak tribes, who inhabit the
interior as well as the larger part of the coast and the banks of the rivers, is to attack
their neighbours for the sake of obtaining heads, and that no lover can present himself before
his intended bride until he offers her one of those gory trophies as a proof of his prowess.
The greater the number of heads he can present, the more willing the damsel becomes to receive
his advances. Notwithstanding such a peculiar custom, the Dyaks possess many excellent qualities.
They are said to be truthful and honest, generally intelligent, kind tempered and mild, and
tolerably industrious; superior indeed in many respects to the Malays and Chinese, who cheat
and plunder them.

"While we are opening up Africa, it seems to me that we should make an effort to civilise and
carry the blessings of Christianity to the numberless inhabitants of Borneo beyond the province
of Sarawak."

We passed through the Straits of Balabac, between Borneo and the long island of Palawan into
the Sooloo Sea, said to be infested by pirates, who have little difficulty in escaping pursuit
among the numerous islands to the south, forming the Looloo Archipelago.  To the east of us
were the Philippine islands, owned and misgoverned by the Spaniards.

We, however, kept along the coast of Borneo, and though pirates might have swarmed in its bays
and rivers, we were fortunate in not falling in with any.  We met, however, several traders,
Chinese as well as Malay, from whom we made inquiries through Ned respecting the wreck of an
English vessel in those seas.  Blyth also endeavoured to obtain information as to where the
articles we wished to procure were most likely to be obtained.  The captain of one of the Malay
vessels came on board us to do some trading on his own account.  As he seemed inclined to be
communicative, we put several questions to him through Ned, who was evidently highly interested
in the replies he received.

To our questions as to what the Malay said, Ned replied, "He tells me, sir, that he has heard
of several white men being at a village on the banks of a large river some way up from the
coast.  As far as I can make out, they have been there a long time, and the natives won't let
them get away.  The people he speaks of may be Captain Musgrave and some of my old shipmates;
but yet it does not seem to me from the sort of country he describes that it can be near the
place where the `Amphion' was lost."

We told Ned to inquire if one of the men belonging to the prahu would be willing to pilot us
up the river, promising him a handsome reward if he would do so, and undertaking to set him
on shore at any place he might name which we could reach.  For this purpose the first mate,
Blyth, and I, taking Ned, went with the Malay captain on board his vessel. Summoning his crew,
he explained the object of our visit and the offer which had been made.  After a long palaver
a man stepped out and expressed his readiness to accompany us.  The Malay captain, after a
short talk with the man, introduced him to us, saying that his name was Kalong, that he was
well acquainted with the coast and an experienced sailor, as indeed are most of the Malays
of the archipelago.  This matter, with which all parties were pleased, being settled, we returned
to the "Lily," and sail was made for the part of the coast where Kalong informed us we should
find the mouth of the river.  We hove to soon after sunset that we might not pass the spot
during the night.

When Kalong came on deck at daybreak, we once more stood in for the coast.  The wind, however,
was light, so that we made but little progress.  He pointed to the southward, indicating that
we must steer in that direction.  At length, to our great joy, we saw what was evidently the
mouth of a large river, fringed thickly with mangrove trees.

Ned shook his head.  "That's not where the `Amphion' was cast away," he remarked, as we stood
towards it.  "Still it may be, notwithstanding, that our friends are up there.  Kalong says
that there is water enough for the brig all the way up to the village, but he thinks it would
be wiser to anchor just within the mouth and let only the boats go up, as the wind might fail
us and we might have a hard job to get out again. As it is a long pull he also advises that
the boats should leave the brig in the evening, so as to get to the place the next day."

This advice exactly agreed with what the first mate thought best, and Captain Haiselden, whom
he consulted, was of the same opinion.  We accordingly, the wind favouring us, stood on and
brought up just inside the mouth, which formed a beautiful harbour.  We lost no time in getting
ready for our expedition.  Two boats were lowered, each pulling four oars, the crews consisting
of four Englishmen and four Lascars, besides Kalong and Ned, the first mate and I going in
one and Mr Blyth and the boatswain in the other.  We were all well-armed, and had provisions
for a couple of days.  We also carried a number of articles for trading with the natives, whom
we hoped, from Kalong's account, to find friendly.

We had thus left but a small number of men on board, but as the brig was in a safe place, the
captain, trusting to Kalong's report, considered that there was no risk of her being attacked
by pirates.  I heard him tell the first mate, however, when we went into his cabin to wish
him good-bye, that he should have a sharp look-out kept, the guns loaded, and all hands armed
in case of accident; and, he added, "Remember, Radburn, that you are to run no unnecessary
risk; don't trust the natives too much, and keep your party well together if you land, so as
to be able to get back to the boats.  Kalong may be a very honest fellow, but it is as well
not to rely too much on him.  If you hear of any Englishmen being in the village or neighbourhood,
get Kalong to open up a communication with them, and send a written note to ask who they are."

"Aye, aye, sir!" answered Uncle Jack; "you may depend upon my discretion."

I naturally felt very eager, for I had persuaded myself that we should certainly find my father,
notwithstanding Ned's doubts.  I do not think my uncle was quite so sanguine, still he was
very willing to undertake the expedition.  We had on board a small light canoe, which we had
brought from Singapore, large enough to carry two or three people, but easily paddled by one.
At the last moment it was determined to carry this canoe with us, as she could tow astern,
and might be of great use in sending ahead to act as a scout.

As soon as everything was ready we shoved off, our shipmates remaining on board, giving us
three hearty cheers as we pulled away.  We found that the river made several bends, so that
in a short time we were out of sight of the brig.  The monkeys occasionally showed themselves,
leaping along the branches, often running out to those above our heads and uttering hoarse
cries, as if ordering us away from their domains, grinning fiercely at us, hooting and chattering,
and shaking the boughs in their indignation.

We had got up some distance, and calculated that it would be dark in the course of a short
time, when, having entered another reach, we saw before us on the right hand shore an opening
in which were several huts, of a construction common in that country, being erected on tall
posts with a ladder leading to them.

Kalong said that he was not aware of any village being there, and that it had probably not
long been established.  As we could see only three huts, and as there were not likely to be
many inhabitants, he and Ned offered to go on shore and obtain information, while we remained
in the boats with our arms ready for use, should the natives show any signs of hostility. 
Uncle Jack, however, directed us to keep our weapons concealed, while we had, besides the English
ensign, a white flag flying in the bows of our boat.

Blyth, on hearing of the plan, wished to land, and my uncle, after a little hesitation, gave
me leave to accompany him, provided we kept behind Kalong and Ned until they had ascertained
the character of the people.  We accordingly at once pulled in for the bank.  Kalong and Ned
sprang on shore, Blyth and I fallowing.  We had pistols in our belts, and each wore a sword;
but, as the Malays all go armed, such weapons were not likely to make them suppose that we
were otherwise than peaceably disposed.

We had not proceeded far, when several Dyaks, who had apparently been watching us from their
elevated dwellings, came down the ladders which led from them to the ground, and made friendly
gestures, inviting us to advance.  The men wore waist cloths of blue cotton which hung down
behind, and were bordered with blue, white, and red.  Their heads were bound with handkerchiefs
of the same colours.  They wore earrings of brass, and heavy necklaces of black and white beads.
On their arms were a number of rings of white shells or brass, their long shining black hair
hanging over their shoulders, and to their waists, secured by a belt, was a pouch with materials
for "betel" chewing.  In the belt was stuck a long slender knife, and most of the men held
in their hands a knife-headed spear.

The women, who were better clothed than the men, wore coils of rattan to which their petticoats
were fastened round their waists, besides which their arms and legs were ornamented with rings
of brass wire, and their heads by hats of curious shape, adorned with beads.  They had generally
a pleasant expression of countenance, and appeared ready to afford us a friendly welcome.

Kalong and Ned at once entered into conversation with them, as they seemed perfectly to understand
each other.  No information, however, could be obtained about the white men of whom we had
heard.  Without hesitation they came down to the boats, bringing some mats and other articles
which we purchased at a very moderate rate.  They had also with them some curious monkeys with
enormous noses, faces of a brick-dust colour, and about as ugly specimens of the monkey tribe
as I ever saw.

Their bodies were about three feet in length covered with thick fur, of a bright chestnut-red.
I am almost afraid to say how long their noses were, but they stuck out with the nostrils at
the tips and had certainly a most curious appearance.  The arms and legs had somewhat of a
whitish tinge, and the hands were grey rather than black.  Ned told us that they were very
active, and when at liberty could be seen leaping from branch to branch, generally in large
troops, holloaing loudly as they go along. Blyth purchased a couple, as they were very tame
and seemed well-mannered.  He hoped to be able to keep them alive if he could obtain suitable food.

After a short and satisfactory intercourse with our native friends, we shoved off and proceeded
up the river.  The tide, however, soon turned, and Uncle Jack, considering that it would be
useless to attempt pulling against it, brought up for the night a short distance from the left
bank, but sufficiently far off not to run the risk of being surprised by hostile natives.

As we had a long pull before us, the first mate arranged that all hands should lie down except
two in each boat to keep watch, that we might be the better able to work the next day.  Supper,
however, was first served out, for we had hitherto not had time to eat anything.  It was arranged
that Ned and I should have the first watch in our boat, and as soon as supper was over, the
rest of the party stowed themselves away as best they could on or under the thwarts.  The boats
lay in the shadow cast by the tall trees on the bank nearest to us, from which strange sounds
ever and anon came off, produced either by wild beasts or insects, not sufficiently loud to
drown the ripple of the water as it flowed rapidly by.  The bright stars shone down from a
cloudless sky on the surface of the stream, flickering and dancing in the eddies caused by
the current.

I found great difficulty in keeping awake, though, of course, I did my best to prevent my eyelids
from closing by constantly shifting my position and looking round in every direction, not that
I apprehended danger, but from knowing that it was my duty to be prepared for any contingency.

I had been on watch for an hour or more, when Ned, who was seated on a thwart, stepped aft.
"Hist, Mr Harry," he said, in a low whisper, "do you hear the sound of voices coming down the
river?"

I fancied that I did.

"Just listen."

I listened, and after some time could distinctly hear some strange sounds, though I was not
certain that they were those of human voices. I awoke the first mate, who also heard them.

"If you like, sir, Kalong and I will pull up in the canoe and try and find out where they come
from," whispered Ned; "it may be that the natives are only holding one of their harvest feasts
near the bank of the river, or it is just as likely that a fleet of pirates has come up through
some other branch of the river, and has been plundering the villages they have fallen in with,
as I have known them often to do in these parts.  It wouldn't be safe to fall in with them.
They would soon run down our boats and not leave a man of us alive."

"Though you may be mistaken, we will take the prudent course and try to find out who the people
are," answered the first mate.  "Wake up Kalong, and you and he jump into the canoe and paddle
ahead until you have discovered what they are about.  Take care, however, that you are not
caught yourselves."

Ned awakened the Malay and explained the object we had in view, when the two hauling up the
canoe alongside got into her and noiselessly paddled up the river, keeping near the bank where
we lay moored.

We waited anxiously listening for any sound, but a light breeze rustling among the trees prevented
those we had before heard from reaching our ears.

"Ned, I hope, may have been mistaken, after all," observed the first mate; "it would be a pity,
having got this far, to have to give up our expedition; but, as he says, it would never do
to run the risk of an encounter with those savage pirates.  If he is right we must do our best
to avoid them and be ready for a start."

All hands in both boats had been aroused, and we were prepared to heave up our anchors and
get out the oars at a moment's notice.  We had not only our own safety to think of, but that
of our shipmates, if there really was a fleet of pirates in the river, should they discover
the brig--ill able to defend herself as she was--they might attack and capture her before we
could get on board.  We had brought the two boats alongside each other, so that we could talk
without raising our voices. The first mate, who had been standing up on the after thwart that
he might the better be able to see any object ahead, at length observed, "The canoe ought to
have been back by this time.  Can she have been taken by the savages?"

"If so, Kalong and Ned may for the sake of saving their lives have told them about the brig,"
observed the boatswain.  "If there is another channel the pirates will go down it and attack
her before they look after us."

"I feel very sure that Ned will not prove treacherous, though I cannot say how the Malay will
act," I observed.

"At all events we will get up our anchors and be ready for a start," said the first mate.

He gave the order accordingly.  Just as they were up to the bows, I caught sight of a small
object ahead, which I trusted was the canoe.  I pointed it out to the first mate.

"No doubt about it.  I hope that we shall find that we might have saved ourselves the trouble
of weighing," he observed.

It approached rapidly.  In little more than a minute it dropped alongside us and Ned and Kalong
leapt into our boat.

"Not a moment to lose!" exclaimed Ned; "there's a whole fleet of prahus in the next reach.
Some of the people were ashore, and that we might find out who they were, we landed some way
below where they lay and crept up close to them until we could hear them speaking.  They know
of the brig, and, we found, were just about to get under weigh hoping to surprise her."

"We must be on board first, then, or they'll murder the whole of us. Out oars, lads, and pull
as you never pulled before," cried the first mate.

The crews required no further orders, the boats were got round and away we went with the current,
the men pulling with all their might.

"We must go on board and fight for our lives, for if we are taken they'll not be worth much,"
said the first mate.

"My poor father, what will become of him?"  I exclaimed.

"We have no proof that your father is among the white men spoken of, Harry.  If he is, he will
not be worse off than he would have been had we not gone up the river.  We must, however, try
and ascertain the truth of the report, and make another attempt to rescue him should we find
that he is really there."

We had not much time or inclination for talking; while the first mate steered, I kept looking
astern to ascertain if we were pursued.  We rapidly shot by the places we had slowly passed
coming up; we were thankful that we had the tide in our favour.  We had got to the end of a
long reach, when I saw rounding the further end of the point we had last passed a number of
dark objects stretching across the stream.  I had no doubt that they were the piratical prahus,
though whether they had discovered us or not we could not ascertain.  They were swift craft,
I knew, and might possibly overtake us before we could reach the brig. There was no use in
telling the men to give way, as they were pulling as hard as they could lay their backs to
the oars.  They saw the enemy too, and knew the horrible fate which would be ours should we
be overtaken. We, of course, however, had no intention of yielding as long as we could defend
ourselves; we had our arms therefore ready for instant use.  Hard as our crews pulled, the
prahus appeared to be coming up with us.  Every instant they became more distinct, and we had
little doubt that they must see us.  I had begun to despair of escaping when the first mate
raised our spirits by announcing that he saw the light in the brig's rigging in the distance.
It was to be hoisted on the fore stay that in case we should return at night we might know
where to find her.  It was indeed fortunate that this arrangement had been made, or we might
have run out to sea without observing her.  We now altered our course, hoping that the Malays
might possibly shoot by the brig before they discovered that the light was on board her.  The
first mate hailed the brig as we approached.

"We are pursued by a fleet of pirates.  Stand by to hoist in the boats, and to make sail as
soon as we are on board."

The captain hailed in reply, "We are on the alert.  Pull up one on each quarter."

The moment we got alongside the falls were slackened and we swarmed up them, each man running
to the tackles as he got on deck.  The boats were quickly hoisted in, when the crew ran aloft
to loose the sails.  The wind was blowing down the river, but there was barely enough of it
to give the vessel steerage way, and without a stronger breeze we should run the risk of drifting
on shore.  The cable, however, was hove short, and we were ready at a moment's notice to stand
out to sea.  The dark line of prahus were, however, in the meantime approaching, evidently,
by their appearance, with hostile intent.

As they drew nearer the pirates suddenly broke forth into loud cries, sounding their trumpets
and beating their gongs and tom-toms, apparently with the intention of frightening us.  We
had our guns pointed at them and the matches ready to fire the instant the captain issued the
order, but he was unwilling if it could be avoided to commence the fight, and waited until
they should show their hostile intentions.  Of these we were not long left in doubt.  They
had probably expected to surprise the brig, but now, from having seen the boats ahead, they
knew that we should be on the alert.  Again bursting forth into shouts and shrieks, and making
all the noise they could with their musical instruments, they opened a fire from their gingalls
and muskets, followed up by a shower of darts.  Although we could hear the missiles come rattling
on board, being sheltered by our high bulwarks, no one, as far as I could tell, was hurt.

"Now give it them, lads!" cried the captain.  We let fly with all our guns, those having muskets
firing them also.  We quickly reloaded, to be ready for the enemy should they attempt to board
us.  When I saw the number of prahus which had assembled on all sides, I could not help fearing
that we might be overpowered at last.  Still the first dose we had given them seemed to have
produced a good effect.

"Fire, my lads, and load again as fast as you can," cried the captain. "We must keep them off
until we can get the brig under weigh.  Hurrah! Here comes a breeze.  Quick, quick, give it them!"

We fired another broadside.  "Now heave up the anchor and sheet home the topsails," he shouted.

The order was obeyed, and before the pirates had recovered from the dismay into which our last
broadside had thrown them, the anchor was hove up to the bows, and the topsails being sheeted
home and the mainsail set, we were gliding out towards the mouth of the river, not, however,
without being accompanied by our persevering foes.

We had several on either side of us blazing away with their gingalls and hurling darts and
spears on our decks.  At last one more daring than the rest ran alongside just as we had discharged
our two guns, and her crew began climbing on board.  The first mate and boatswain and several
of the men were ready to receive them, and beat them back with pikes and cutlasses.  The rest
of our crew were employed in defending the other side, though it was sharp work to keep them
back.  Several of the pirates were cut down as they showed their heads over the bulwarks, but
others climbed up after them.  Blyth and I, seeing how hard pressed the first mate was, sprang
to his assistance, while the captain was everywhere, now at the helm, now on one side, now
on the other, encouraging the crew, slashing away at the pirates, and seeing that the man at
the helm was steering as was necessary.

The chief part of the fighting took place between the main and fore chains.  Several heads
appeared abaft the main rigging, though quickly driven back again by the captain's untiring
cutlass, aided by Blyth and me.  Every moment we expected other prahus to come up on the opposite
side, but they kept away, waiting perhaps until their chief had gained a footing on our deck.
Meanwhile our long gun and the two carronades, besides several muskets--with which we kept
up a hot fire--contributed to keep them at a respectful distance.  The cabin windows had been
battened up, but another prahu attempted to throw some men on board by getting under our stern.
The captain, however, who was on the watch for this, caught sight of her, and calling to Blyth
and me, we used our cutlasses and pikes with such good effect that the enemy was driven back
and their prahu fell astern.  I was springing off the poop when I caught sight of a man just
creeping in through an after port.  I was on the point of running at him with my pike, when
he cried out--

"A friend, a friend, don't strike!"

It was with the greatest difficulty I avoided doing so.  "Whoever you are, get in quickly,
that I may close the port, or others will follow," I exclaimed.

He did as I advised, and assisted me in lashing down the port.  "I'll do it," he said, "for
I don't want to be caught again," and with the quickness of a seaman he secured the port.

"If you give me a cutlass I'll fight for you," he said; and as I handed him mine he sprang
to the side and soon made good use of it by cutting down a couple of fellows who had at that
moment shown themselves above the bulwarks, while Blyth and I with our pikes drove back two
more who were climbing on board.  The next instant I heard the first mate singing out--

"They are sheering off!  Now give it them, lads!  Fire low and we shall send the shot through
her bottom."

It took some little time, however, to load the guns, and before they could be fired the prahu
had got some fathoms off.  The shot, however, took all the better effect, and went crashing
through her thin sides. Almost in an instant she filled, when the survivors of her crew attempted
to gain the other prahus, which kept on our beam, and now again began to discharge their guns
and other missiles at us as before. The breeze, however, was freshening, and we could see that
our shot had taken effect on several of the other prahus, which sank as we watched them.  Our
crew uttered a loud cheer, to show the enemy that they might expect as warm a reception as
before should they again attempt to board us.  Having now time to set the foresail and topgallant-sails,
fast as the Malays pulled, we had every reason to hope that we should get clear of them.

CHAPTER FOUR.

The pirates, though so roughly handled, continued hovering on every side, making way with their
oars, perhaps hoping that the wind might fall, and should the brig be becalmed that they might
attack us with greater advantage than before.  Happily, however, the breeze freshened, and
we kept up so continuous a fire from our long gun and carronades that they were afraid of approaching
nearer.

"Keep it up, my lads," said the captain, "we shall soon give them the go-bye.  They'll not
wish to pay us another visit."

Soon after this, looking eastward, I saw the first bright streaks of the dawn appearing in
the sky.  The light rapidly increased; we could now clearly distinguish the prahus dotting
the smooth ocean.  There were a dozen of them at least, and we had sent two, if not more, to
the bottom. I had hitherto been so busily employed in working one of the guns that I had been
unable to make any inquiries of the stranger as to who he was or where he had come from.  He
had been assisting at the aftermost gun until, overcome with fatigue, he had sunk down on the
deck just under the poop, where he had remained unnoticed.  As our crew saw the pirate fleet
dropping astern out of range of our guns they broke into loud cheers, joined in even by those
most badly wounded.  At the same time the sun, appearing like an arch of fire, rose from behind
the distant land, suffusing the whole eastern sky with a ruddy glow, and then rapidly shooting
upward, the entire circle made its appearance.  I now hurried off to the stranger, followed
by the first mate, hoping that he might give us tidings of my father, yet almost dreading to
hear what those tidings might be.  He tried to rise as we approached, but had scarcely strength
left to do so.  His countenance was pale, his clothes wet and blood-stained.

Uncle Jack lifted him up and seated him on a gun.  "You are hungry and knocked up, my man.
When you have had some food you shall tell us where you came from, and how you got on board
the brig."

"Thank you, sir.  I do want food, and should be glad to get a wound I have in my side looked
to, as it is beginning to hurt."

Uncle Jack told me to go and forage in the cabin for such food as I could lay hands on, while
he did his best to bind up the man's wound. The second mate and steward, I should have said,
were engaged in attending to the hurts of the other men.  Strange as it may seem, notwithstanding
the numbers of shot, spears, and bullets sent on board us, no one had been killed.

The captain was on the poop, attending to the steering of the brig and watching the proceedings
of the enemy.

I soon returned with some ham and bread and a mug of water, and I got from the steward some
bandages and salve.  While Uncle Jack carefully bound up his wound, the stranger eagerly took
a draught of water, and was then able to swallow some of the food I had brought.

We had hitherto restrained our eagerness; but as soon as he appeared somewhat recovered, my
uncle told him how much we wished to hear the account he had to give of himself, adding that
we had gone up the river to search for some Englishmen said to be prisoners to the natives.

"We expected to find my father, Captain Musgrave, who lately commanded the `Amphion,'" I observed.

The stranger's answer at once dispelled my hopes.

"I was one of the Englishmen you heard of, but we were not prisoners. There was another man
with me; we belonged to a vessel from Sydney trading with the natives, but having had a quarrel
with our skipper, we were left behind.  We thought that we could establish a trade with the
natives, as my mate had once done in one of the South Sea islands, and we were waiting until
another vessel should come up the river.  We had been there three years or more, and were becoming
accustomed to the life, though we had made up our minds to go away if any vessel appeared.
Two nights ago we were sleeping in our house close to the bank of the river, when we were awakened
by fearful shrieks and cries.  Looking out we saw a number of prahus brought up along the bank,
and hundreds of fellows, whom we knew to be pirates, with swords in their hands, rushing about
setting fire to the houses and cutting off the heads of the unfortunate people as they tried
to escape from the flames.  They had not yet discovered our house, but as a party of them drew
near we sang out to them, saying that if they wished to be friends with us we were ready to
be friends with them; but if not, we were determined to fight to the last, besides which we
threatened to set fire to the house and to destroy all the goods within it, but which we offered
otherwise to make over to them.  We took aim as we spoke at their chief, who appeared at their
head.  They seemed to think that they might obtain our heads at too high a price if they attacked
us; and having held a palaver, the chief promised that if we would come out of our house our
lives should be safe.  We, knowing very well that though we might kill two or three of them--should
they not value our goods they would burn us out in a few minutes--thought it wise to agree
to their terms.  We told them, however, that we must think over the matter, and if they would
leave us in quiet a short time we would give them an answer.  As they had killed all the people
they could catch, the rest having escaped into the woods, they were perfectly satisfied, I
suppose, with their night's work. Leaving a guard to watch us, the rest employed themselves
in embarking all the booty they had collected.  At last the chief came back, which made us
believe that he intended to act fairly--he knew that we could have shot him if we had been
so disposed.  He now shouted out to us that as he wanted to be off we must make up our minds
either to accompany him or be killed.  We replied that if we were killed our countrymen would
hear of it and punish him some day or other pretty severely.  He had heard, I doubt not, of
the punishment the pirates had received in the neighbourhood of Sarawak.  He swore by the prophet
that no harm should happen to us.

"`Well, Charley,' said my mate, Pat Tandy, `there is no use making more ado about the matter.
We shall only put the fellow out of temper.  It is our only chance.'

"I agreed with him, and opening the door of our house, we went down the steps, holding our
muskets in our hands ready to have a last shot if we saw that the pirates intended to play
us a trick.  We walked straight up to the chief and took his hand to show him that we were
not afraid.  As soon as we were out of the house, the people rushed in and soon carried away
the goods, the result of our trading--mats, skins, nuts, and other things.  The chief told
us that we must give up our muskets, as he wanted them; and as there was nothing said about
them in our agreement, we handed them to him, not feeling very sure but that the next moment
we might find our heads off our shoulders.  However, he was a more honest man in that respect
than we took him for.

"He now marched us down to the bank, put Tandy on board his prahu, and I was ordered on board
another.  We had been so long with the natives that we understood their language.  They were
pretty free and easy in talking, but we could not make out what they intended to do with us.
I suspected, however, that all was not right when they kept us apart, so I made up my mind
to escape on the first opportunity, and I had no doubt that Pat would do the same.

"We remained where we were until news was brought that an English merchant vessel had anchored
in the mouth of the river, and they, having held a counsel, determined to attack her.  I tried
to escape, hoping to warn you of your danger, but I was caught, and was threatened if I made
another attempt that I should lose my life.  You know most of the rest. If the pirates had
found you napping, they would have murdered every one of you and plundered your brig.  I felt
sure, from the way you defended yourselves, that you would gain the victory.  I took the opportunity
while the Malays were engaged in fighting you to jump overboard and swim to you.  Just as I
reached the water, a fellow catching sight of me pounded me with his spear, and very nearly
hooked me back; but diving, I came up some distance off, and he thought probably that I was
drowned. As I could find no means of getting up your side, I clambered on board the prahu,
and from her got through the after port, which I found open. What has become of Tandy I cannot
say; he may have attempted to follow my example and has lost his life, or, poor fellow!  They
will kill him when they find I have escaped."

Charley Bell's account of himself was very wonderful, but we had no reason to disbelieve it.

As he was much hurt, the first mate, who was always ready to sacrifice his own comfort for
the good of others, placed him in his own berth that he might the better attend to him.  We
then went to assist my uncle in looking after the other wounded men.  Two were unfit for duty,
but the rest managed to get about with bandaged arms and heads, and a somewhat ghastly crew
they looked.  The second mate and boatswain were slightly hurt, and Blyth had received two
wounds, but neither were of much consequence; while the captain, though three bullets had gone
through his clothes, was uninjured, as were the first mate and I.  On going to the mast-head,
I discovered through the spy-glass the pirate fleet far away astern.  On hearing this the captain
determined to stand out into the sea of Celebes to avoid another encounter with them.

It seemed surprising that although our good captain had been almost confined to his cabin up
to the time we entered the river he should have been able to exert himself as he did when the
brig was attacked, and still more so that he suffered no ill consequences, but rapidly afterwards
regained his health and strength.

Bell told us that had any English vessel been wrecked on the coast he thought he should have
heard of it, so that we were tolerably well satisfied that the "Amphion" had not been cast
away on the east shore of Borneo.

Captain Haiselden had heard at Singapore that the Dutch sent out numerous men-of-war to cruise
round Celebes and the Spice Islands for the purpose of putting down piracy, and as they would
have heard of any vessel cast away near the places they were accustomed to visit, he was convinced
that the "Amphion" must have been wrecked on some island shore to the northward.  He therefore
resolved, instead of running through the Straits of Macassar, to continue eastward across the
sea of Celebes and ultimately rounding the Moluccas, to sail down the coast of New Guinea.
The weather continued remarkably fine, the air was pure, though not cool, and the wounded men,
who were on deck as much as possible, rapidly recovered.

The first place at which it was arranged we should touch was at the northern end of the curiously
shaped island of Celebes.  A strong southerly wind, which afterwards shifted to the south-east,
springing up, compelled us to keep more to the northward than we should otherwise have done.

It was night, we were steering to the eastward but intended soon to put about, expecting on
the next tack to reach Menado, when just at daybreak we found that we were close to an island
with a lofty conical peak and lower ground to the southward of it.  The chart showed us that
it was the island of Sanguir.  A current must have set us towards it, for we supposed that
we were some distance off.  We at once put about, when the wind dropped and we lay perfectly
becalmed on the mirror-like deep.  I could not perceive the slightest swell, nor did even a
cat's-paw play over the surface.  I threw some chips into the water, and when I looked some
hours afterwards there they were, floating like little boats alongside.  The smoke from the
galley-fire curled upwards in a thin blue wreath, growing thinner and thinner until it became
invisible far over head.  Now and then a flying-fish would break through the glassy surface,
or some monster of the deep show us his snout, leaving a circle of wavelets as he quickly descended.
It was even hotter below than on deck, and every piece of metal felt as if just taken from
the furnace. The seams of the deck spluttered and hissed, and as we walked about the pitch
stuck to our feet.  There was nothing, however, in the sky which betokened a hurricane, while
the barometer continued as high as usual.

"I believe it is only an ordinary calm," observed the captain to the first mate, as they stood
under the shade of the mainsail, which hung down without giving a single lazy flap.

"It might, however, be better to take in our light canvas in case a sudden squall should strike
us," observed Uncle Jack.  "It will give the hands something to do, and we can easily make
sail again should a breeze spring up."

"I hope that we may get one before long, for we are drifting in faster than I like to the land;
we will get the cable ranged ready to bring up should it become necessary.  The wind when it
comes may blow off shore, but it may blow on it and we shall be compelled to anchor."

"If we can find sufficiently shallow water outside the breakers," observed Uncle Jack, as he
stepped out from under the shelter of the sail to give the orders he had received.

Having sprung aloft, I had just assisted in furling the main-topgallant-sails and had returned
on deck, when I felt the brig give a heave and suddenly tremble throughout her frame for several
seconds.  We cast inquiring looks at each other, wondering what could have happened.  The first
mate, taking a lead-line, hove it overboard, thinking it possible that the vessel had struck
a reef.

"No bottom!" he exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction.  "What can it be?"

"Little doubt about that," observed the captain, "an earthquake is taking place, see what's
happening there," and he pointed to the island.

As he spoke a dense volume of smoke, followed by ruddy flames, was seen to ascend from the
summit of the cone, while the whole island--from which a dull rumbling sound came off--seemed
for a moment to heave.  We turned out glasses towards it.  All was quiet, but presently we
saw the trees waving to and fro, as if shaken by a hurricane, while vast masses of rock rolled
down from the summits of the hills into the valleys below.  Every instant the eruption from
the volcano was increasing.  In a short time the sky became shrouded by a dense black cloud.
Showers of fine cinders fell on our decks, covering also the hitherto blue ocean with a black
scum.  A red mass of lava bubbled up, as if from some mighty cauldron, above the edge of the
crater, and fiery streams began to flow down the sides of the mountain, some taking a course
towards the ocean, others making their way in the direction of the valleys, threatening to
seize in their course on the tall trees, those near the summit being quickly ablaze.  With
fearful rapidity the conflagration spread, up the hills, across the plains, sweeping over the
plantations and destroying the dwellings of the unfortunate inhabitants.  It seemed impossible
that a single human being could escape.  For some hours we watched the dreadful scene.

"If you will give me leave, sir, I'll go in and try to save some of the poor people," said
the first mate.  "It seems to me that we might approach yonder point without risk.  I see a
village a short distance inland, and that cannot long escape destruction, so that the people
will try to escape to the point, and we might take off some of them.  Others may be saved on
board their own craft lying in the harbour to the southward.  As far as I can make out there
are no boats abreast of us."

"Be quick about it, then, Radburn, for we must not leave the brig short-handed," said the captain.

Blyth and I at once volunteered to go, as did Ned and Bell, thus leaving the vessel with her
full complement of men.  A boat was lowered and away we pulled.  The ashes continued to fall,
and the oppressive heat made it difficult to breathe.  We pulled on, anxious to save as many
of our fellow-creatures as we could.  As we approached the point we saw a number of persons
rushing towards the end, carrying all sorts of articles on their backs, and others following.
Good reason they had to hasten, for the woods at the back of the village were already blazing
furiously, and in another minute it would be in flames.

"We must allow only a dozen to enter the first boat," said Uncle Jack; "if more are taken on
board we shall run the risk of being swamped.  It seems cruel to those left behind, but we
must be determined, and try to make another trip."

As we got nearer, so heavily did the surf break on the extreme end of the point, that it seemed
scarcely possible we ourselves should escape destruction.  On getting in closer, however, we
discovered a bay into which we could run.  As soon as the people saw the boat, they rushed
towards us holding out their arms.  We told Bell to shout to them and say that we could take
only a few at a time, but would return for the rest, and that we must save the women and children
first.  The men did not seem to understand this, and we literally had to drive them back, while
we dragged in the poor women, mostly with infants or young children in their arms.  With these
we could carry many more, and we got on board upwards of twenty.  Those who remained shrieked
and cried, wringing their hands and pointing to the flames as we shoved off.

We bent to our oars as well as we could, crowded as the boat was, and made our way back to
the brig.  The crew stood ready to haul the poor people upon deck.

"You might venture to send another boat, sir," cried Uncle Jack; "there is no sign of wind,
and many more might be saved."

He did not stop, however, for the captain's answer, but the moment the women and children were
out of the boat away we pulled again for the land.  We had not got far when, to my satisfaction,
I saw that another boat had been lowered, and before we reached the shore she overtook us,
under the charge of Mr Crowfoot.

Uncle Jack warned him not to overload his boat.  We followed the same plan as before, taking
in this time several men, which brought the boat down deep in the water, although we had fewer
persons on board than on the first trip.  It was piteous to hear the cries of the poor wretches
we were compelled to leave behind.  Their village had disappeared, and the flames were seizing
on every tree and bush up to the inner part of the rocky point.  At any moment a fiery shower
might come falling down and envelope them.  The heat was greater than ever, and the dust and
ashes, which came showering down upon upon us, almost overpowering. Uncle Jack, thinking only
of saving life, scarcely heeded this.  Again we pulled back to the brig.

"You have done enough, Radburn.  Your lives will be endangered if you return," cried the captain.

"Only one more trip!  Just let me take one more trip, sir," answered the first mate.

The captain could not refuse.  The boatswain followed us.  We reached the little bay in safety.
As I looked up at the mountain I saw that the eruption had become more violent than ever. 
The lurid flames, casting a light over the whole bland, enabled us to see objects as clearly
as in the day-time.  We were engaged in taking the people in, our boat was almost full, when
Uncle Jack cried out, hauling in another poor man as he did so.

"Shove off, pull away for your lives, my lads!"

Looking up for an instant I saw that a fresh outbreak of the mountain was taking place.  Stones,
cinders, and ashes came bursting through the air, and crashing down not many hundred yards
it seemed from where we lay.  The ocean, too, was fearfully agitated, and wave upon wave with
loud roars rolled towards the beach.  The people on shore stretched out their arms imploring
us to take them in, but we could not save them. Had we attempted it our destruction would have
been inevitable.  The boat's head had been got round, and we pulled as we had never pulled
before.  The fearful shower rapidly increased.  A boiling sea washed over the point, and the
hapless beings who stood there disappeared.  Not a cry was heard, their death had been instantaneous.
Even those who had endeavoured to escape by swimming must have been in a moment overwhelmed.
Fast as we pulled, the shower of ashes from the mountain seemed to be following us still faster,
and we could see that the shower stretched away even towards the ship.

Happily the calm continued, and we succeeded in getting on board.  The poor people we had rescued,
while profuse in expressing their thanks to us, gave vent to their grief at the loss of their
relations and friends. We understood also from them that there were other villages in the interior,
which, with all their inhabitants, must have been utterly destroyed.

We afterwards heard that two thousand persons perished.  The people on board were of the Malay
race, and, except through our interpreters, Ned and Charley, we could not understand a word
they said; indeed, the two seamen could only partly make out their language.  We ourselves
were not altogether satisfied with our position.  A strong wind might spring up and drive us
on shore, and we were still so near the volcano that it might cover us, not only with ashes,
but with huge masses of rock and stones, which might come crashing down upon us and send us
to the bottom.  All hands were on deck ready to trim sails the moment the wind should come.
We had not long to wait.  A loud rushing sound was heard. The canvas gave several loud flaps.
The captain had feared that the heat from the burning island might draw the wind towards us.
So it did, but, happily for us, it came from the north-west, though we could not tell to what
quarter it might suddenly shift.

The yards were braced up on the starboard tack, and we stood away from the island, with the
blazing forests on our port-quarter.

The captain's great object now was to get a good offing from Sanguir. He did not intend to
bear up for Menado until daylight.  It was important that we should reach it without delay
to land our passengers, as they would soon exhaust our water and provisions.  We did our best
to attend to the poor people, but they would not be comforted.  They thought of their homes
and relatives destroyed, and knew not what hardships they might have to endure.  As we got
to a distance from the island we could see far away to the southward another bright blaze which
rose from the volcano of Sias, also in a state of eruption.  On looking at the chart we saw
that there was a line of many others, some in the northern end of Celebes, others in Gillolo,
extending northward and all the way round to the west through Java.  We could only hope that
those in the direction to which we were steering might not also burst forth. The wind continued
favourable and moderate.  When the people heard from Ned where we were going they were in a
great fright, declaring that the inhabitants were "head hunters," and that they should all
be killed.

When Ned told me this I inquired of the captain if they had any foundation for their fears.
He replied that formerly the inhabitants of that part of Celebes were as savage as those of
other portions, but that the Dutch have used every possible means to civilise them by giving
them employment, introducing commerce, establishing schools, and sending missionaries among
them, and that thus a wilderness, inhabited by naked savages, who were wont to garnish their
rude houses with human heads, had been converted into a smiling region, with a civilised community.

The next day we made the northern end of Celebes, for which we were steering, and before dark
anchored off the pretty little town of Menado. As we looked at it from our anchorage we could
see rows of rustic houses, with broad paths between them forming streets, mostly at right angles
with each other.

In several directions roads branched off towards the interior, also lined by a succession of
cottages surrounded by gardens and plantations. The captain and Blyth immediately went on shore
to visit the President or Governor, who, on hearing what had happened, allowed us to land our
passengers, promising to look after them, and give them plenty of employment if they were inclined
to labour.  We were thankful to get them out of the brig, and their fears being dissipated
when they saw the civilised state of the country, they thanked us for the kindness shown them,
and we parted good friends.

We afterwards called on an English merchant long settled here, who assured us that the people
would be well cared for and sent back should they wish it to Sanguir, when information could
be received that the volcano was once more at rest.  The chief production of the district is
coffee, of which we shipped a considerable quantity as freight.  We found the account given
by the captain in no way exaggerated, and we could easily believe, as asserted, that the inhabitants
are the most industrious, peaceable, and civilised, that they are better educated, better clothed,
better housed, and better fed of any of the natives of the vast archipelago.  Commerce, a paternal,
though somewhat despotic Government, and education, combined with Christian missionary effort,
has worked the wonderful change in less than forty years.  Our friend, who had a house in the
country, took Mr Blyth and me up to see his plantations, as also a menagerie which he had formed.
In passing a piece of open ground we caught sight of a number of animals, which I supposed
to be dogs.  They were making their way towards an orchard.

"The rascals!" exclaimed our friend, "they are on a predatory expedition, intending to steal
the fruit from yonder trees."

Jumping off his horse, and taking his gun, which his servant carried, he ran towards them.
They did not appear to notice him until he was within shot of them.  He fired, when one fell
and the rest took to flight, quickly scrambling up the trees of the forest, which extended
towards us to within a short distance where they were lost to sight.  It had large callosities,
and a scarcely visible tail, not an inch in length.

Our friend told us that these creatures were monkeys, though more like baboons, that descending
from the trees where they live, they often invade orchards and gardens, and commit great havoc.
Our friend's house was something like an Indian bungalow, though of rougher materials, and
was surrounded by a fine garden and orchard, with extensive plantations in the rear.  I cannot
describe more than two of the animals in his menagerie.  One was the Tapiutan, which from its
appearance I could not say whether it should be called a cow, a buffalo, or an antelope.  It
was of the size of a very small Highland cow, and had long straight horns, which were ringed
at the base, and sloped backwards over the neck.

The strangest animal he showed us was called the Babirusa, which resembled in general appearance
a pig, but it had long and slender legs, and tusks curved upwards so as to look like horns.
Those of the lower jaw were long and sharp, but the upper ones grew upwards out of bony sockets
through the skin on each side of the snout, curving backwards to near the eyes, and were ten
inches long.  Our friend told us that it is found over the whole island.  He supposed the object
of the curling tusks was to preserve the eyes of the animal when searching for the fallen fruits
on which it lives among the tangled thickets of spring plants.  Though the female does not
possess them, perhaps the male gallantly clears the way for her so as to render them unnecessary.
However, I must not stop to give a longer description of this interesting place, or many others
we saw; I indeed made only two trips ashore, as I had to be on board attending to my duty.

CHAPTER FIVE.

Once more the anchor was weighed, and we were about to stand out of the picturesque bay of
Menado the moment a boat, in which Mr Blyth had gone on shore to bring off a supply of fresh
provisions, returned.

Ned, who had been one of the crew, as soon as the sails were set, came up to me.  "I've just
heard something, sir, which may or may not be of importance," he said.  "I was talking to one
of the men we brought off from Sanguir, when he confessed to me that he had been on board the
prahu which took me off the shore where we were wrecked.  I think he spoke the truth when he
told me how I kicked when the pirates made me take an oar and pull with the black fellows they
had, I suppose, made slaves of.  I asked him if he could tell me where the place was.  He answered
that it was on the shores of a large island--a very large one, I should think, and away somewhere
to the eastward, for he pointed in that direction, though I could not make out exactly how
far off it was."

I was deeply interested, and told him that he ought to have brought the man on board that we
might have examined him more particularly with the aid of Bell and Kalong.

"He would have been afraid to trust himself, sir," answered Ned; "as he owned that he had been
a pirate, he was afraid that the captain or the Dutch might punish him."

I immediately communicated what I had heard to the first mate, who told the captain.  They
sent for Ned, who, as he said that he had got all the information he could out of the Malay,
they did not propose putting back, as I fancied they would have done.  I do not think that
the captain was sanguine about finding any of the "Amphion's" crew, though Uncle Jack kept
up his hopes and mine.

"It may be like looking for a needle in a bundle of hay; still, if we search long enough, the
needle will be found," he remarked.  "As long as the captain will agree we will continue the
search."

Rounding the northern end of Celebes, we crossed the Molucca passage for Ternate, where we
were to call.  It is a small island off the coast of the large but little known one of Gillolo.
As we approached we saw rising out of the sea in a line several conical-shaped mountains, four
thousand feet in height, one of which the captain said was Ternate, for which we were bound.
Passing between that island and Tidore, of even greater height, we anchored before the town
which stretches along the shore, while the mountain overhanging it was clothed to a considerable
height with trees and spice plantations.  The scenery was truly magnificent, but as we thought
of the eruption of Sanguir, we saw in what a moment the whole town and neighbourhood might
be reduced to desolation should an eruption burst forth from the mountains which rose so grandly
above our heads.  We remained here four days, during which an earthquake--an event of frequent
occurrence--took place.

I grudged every moment's delay, and was thankful when we once more were steering southward.
We were sailing on with a light breeze through a perfectly smooth sea, when a dull roaring
sound was heard, like a heavy surf astern.  The roar rapidly increased, and we saw a white
line of foam rolling on.  Thinking that it might be the precursor of a hurricane, we clewed
up the topsails, but as the wave passed we rode easily over it with the same sort of movement
which is felt when entering a river across a bar.  It was followed with a short interval by
another of similar character, succeeded with greater rapidity by ten or twelve more, when the
sea became as smooth as before.  The captain had no doubt that these waves were caused by an
earthquake occurring at some distance to the northward.  While at Ternate we heard that a suspicious
fleet of large prahus had been seen steering to the southward.  It was intended, should a Dutch
man-of-war arrive, to send her to watch their proceedings.  We were advised to keep a sharp
look-out for the pirates, and avoid them if we could.  "If they think you are Dutch, they'll
be cautious how they molest you; but if they suppose that you belong to any other nation, they
are very likely to try and plunder you, as they are aware that no men-of-war except those of
the Dutch are accustomed to cruise in these seas," said our friend, an English merchant residing
in the place.

Captain Haiselden thanked his informant, and replied that we had already fallen in with such
gentry, and knew how to deal with them.

"But these are larger and more formidable craft than those by which you were before attacked.
If they once get alongside your brig, you will find it a difficult matter to beat them off,"
was the reply.

Wherever we touched we made inquiries about the "Amphion," but as yet we had only the information
gained through Ned from the Sanguir Malay to guide us.  She might have been lost at Gillolo
itself, and yet the Dutch might not have heard of it, as but very irregular intercourse is
kept up between the different parts of that little known island.

Proceeding south we passed between the islands of Bouro and Ceram, calling at Amboina and Banda,
spice islands belonging to the Dutch.

We were steering to the east when land was sighted from the mast-head on the starboard bow.
I went aloft.  It was a small island, one of many extending directly across our course.  Intending
to pass to the northward of it we luffed up a little, when, after standing on some way further,
I was again sent to the mast-head, to see if I could discover any intervening coral reefs or
any others running out from it.  I could discover no variation of colour in the sea to indicate
the existence of hidden reefs in our course, but my eye fell on a dark object, a mile, or it
may have been less, from the shore.  At the first glance I thought it was a rock rising out
of the water, but on descending to the cross-trees and looking through my glass I saw that
the object was a ship on a reef, heeling over to one side, with, as far as I could make out,
her topmasts, if not her lower masts, gone; at all events she had no canvas set.  On coming
down to the deck, I told the first mate, who had charge of the watch, and he went aloft and
had a look at her also.

"She's in a dangerous position, and I fear is wrecked," he observed. "We must get up to her,
and try to render her assistance.  If she's not to be got off, we shall have to take her people
on board."

"Has she been driven by a gale on the reef, do you think?"  I asked.

"No; I should say that she was brought up by it, and that the tide has since fallen, leaving
her in her present position, so that when it rises she may be got off."

While we were speaking the sails gave several flaps against the masts, a sign that the wind
had suddenly fallen, and we lay becalmed.  This was the more tantalising as we were anxious
to go to the assistance of the ship.

I went below to inform the captain, who at once came on deck, and, after looking round the
horizon, said that he thought a breeze would soon again spring up, and that we would then stand
towards the ship and see what we could do, adding, "in the meantime, as the tide rises she
may probably haul off without our assistance."

"I should like to take one of the boats and pull on board her," observed Uncle Jack.

"As it must be several hours before you could be back again, the weather might in the meantime
change; so that I cannot consent to your going," answered the captain, in a tone which prevented
the first mate from making a reply.

Still Uncle Jack, not satisfied, walked the deck uneasily.  He wished at once to relieve the
anxiety of those on board the ship by letting them know that assistance was near should they
not have observed the brig.

Hour after hour passed by, darkness came on, and still no breeze ruffled the surface of the
ocean.  All night long the calm continued.

As soon as daylight broke, I was again aloft looking out for the ship. There she lay in the
same position as before; it was evident that whatever exertions had been made to get her off,
they had been unsuccessful.  I was about to come on deck again, when, sweeping my glass round
to the northward, I made out another island of large size apparently.  Between it and where
the ship lay I fancied that I could distinguish a number of small black dots, so faint, however,
that had I not steadied my glass, which was a very good one, I should not have observed them.
Recollecting what we had heard about the pirate fleet, a fear seized me at once that they might
be prahus, and that they were on their way to pillage the wreck, which they must have discovered
while lying off the northern island.  Whether they had discovered us it was impossible to say,
but they certainly would do so when the sun rose and shone on our canvas.

I at once came down and told the first mate, who took a hurried glance round the horizon in
the hopes of discovering the signs of a coming breeze.

"I must get the captain to let me take a boat to warn the crew of the ship of their danger,
and to assist them if they are attacked," he exclaimed.  "We may get there before the prahus,
which do not pull as fast as they can sail, and a few well-armed men may turn the scale against
them; but I'll have a look at them first."

Taking the glass he sprang aloft.  Directly afterwards the captain appeared and asked him what
he was looking at.  I told him.

"I hope we shall get a breeze, for if the pirates, as I suppose they are, see us boldly standing
towards them, they will hesitate before they meddle with the wreck," he remarked, now apparently
as anxious about the vessel on shore as we had been.  "It may have a good effect if we hoist
a pendant and the Dutch flag and fire a gun.  They will take us for a man-of-war, and probably
be off again as fast as they can pull; but it is the breeze we want, the breeze!  Without that
we are helpless."

The first mate soon came down from aloft and again proffered his request.

"I dare not give you leave," answered the captain.  "What could one or even two boats do against
those prahus, with twenty or thirty well-armed men in each?  You might be cut off, even before
you could reach the wreck; and if you were on board, you would be able to do but little to
defend her, as in the position she lies she could not work her guns if she had any."

I was almost surprised at the way Uncle Jack pleaded to be allowed to go.

"It is impossible," replied the captain, "I could not reconcile it to my conscience.  We might
lose half the ship's company, and be unable to defend the brig ourselves."

I never saw the first mate so put out as he was at this answer.  He turned away and continued
walking the deck with uneasy strides until he seemed almost beside himself.  He again went
aloft and stood watching the prahus through his glass, occasionally turning his eye round the
horizon, and then he shouted, "A breeze!  A breeze coming up from the south-west!"  The next
instant down he slid on deck.

The vessel's head, which had been turning now to one point of the compass now to another, was
fortunately just then turned in the right way.

The captain kept a sharp look-out in the direction from whence the wind was coming, to judge
whether it was likely to be a strong or a light breeze.

"Set the royals, Radburn.  We need not be afraid of it."

The order was quickly obeyed.  Scarcely were the sails sheeted home than they blew gently out.
The topgallant-sails did the same; the topsails soon filled.  The brig gathering way steered
a little to the northward so as to intercept the prahus.

We were thankful for the breeze, but we would rather have avoided a struggle.

"You'll have the studding-sails set, sir?" said Uncle Jack, scarcely waiting for an answer
before he gave the order, and sprang forward to assist in carrying it out.

We soon had the studding-sails below and aloft, still the brig did not move along as rapidly
as we wished.  By this time the pirates might have seen us, as the sun was shining brightly
on our royals and topgallant-sails, though we could not make them out except from aloft.

We were not long in manufacturing a Dutch pennant, which was run up to the main-royal mast-head.
It was doubtful, however, whether it would be seen, or, if seen, have the effect we hoped for.
The pirates, observing how light the wind was, would know that they could pull away beyond
our reach.

Again and again Uncle Jack went aloft, until we got near enough to distinguish not only the
ship on the reef but the prahus from the deck, which were approaching fearfully near her; the
guns were loaded and the small arms got ready for immediate use.  Most of the men were ready
enough for a fight, if a fight was to take place, but the second mate looked downcast as usual,
and I heard him muttering--

"We have enough to do to look after ourselves, without fighting for other people."

This was said for the first mate to hear, but Uncle Jack turned away without making any observation.

The prahus, although we must have been seen, still continued their course.  Sometimes the hope
came across me that they might not be intending to attack the ship ashore; but it was scarcely
to be thought that they were going to render her assistance.  As we examined them through our
glasses, we could see that they were large war prahus with numerous crews.  The breeze filled
our sails, but continued light as at first, and we had done all that was possible to make the
brig move through the water.

Two prahus, apparently the fastest, were leading, and were already scarcely more than two miles
off, while we were at a much greater distance.  They would be up to the ship in twenty minutes
or so, and it would take them but a fearfully short time to perform their work of murder and
pillage if they were so minded.  Still we hoped that the crew would fight, and, at all events,
keep them at bay until we could come up.  The pirates were calculating, it was evident, on
the wind falling, of which there appeared every probability.  Several times the lower canvas
had given some ominous flaps against the masts, while the studding-sails hung down from the
booms emptied of wind; still the royals filled and forced the brig along.

Our glasses were constantly turned, now towards the ship on shore, now towards the pirate fleet.
It showed great hardihood on the part of the Malays that they should still continue their course,
while our vessel, which they must have supposed to be a man-of-war, was so close to them. They
were trusting, we thought, to their numbers, and to the rapidity with which they could make
their escape among the coral reefs, where no sailing vessel could follow them.  They were getting
closer and closer, while we were making scarcely two knots an hour through the water.  What
means of defence the ship might possess we could not tell.  Even if she had guns she would,
as the captain remarked, be unable to work them with her deck inclined as it now was.  We could
only hope that the tide was rising, and that if so she might get on an even keel, although
her crew might not be able to haul her off.

We carried, I should have said, a light whale boat, remarkable for her speed; she pulled four
oars, and held three persons besides.  The wind provokingly tantalised us, now it filled the
sails and then again allowed them to hang loosely down from the yards.

I had gone forward with the first mate that we might watch the ship and the headmost of the
prahus.  He several times sent me aft that I might take a look astern to see if there were
any signs of the breeze increasing.  On each occasion I had to make the same report.

"She's lifting, she's lifting?" exclaimed Uncle Jack, at length; "see, she's making signals.
Run, Harry, and get the signal book, we will try and learn what she is saying."

I quickly returned with the book, but the wind was so light that the flags did not blow out.
"A breath of air for a single moment would enable us to see what they are," observed the first
mate, watching them through his telescope.  Just then one flag flew out, it was to signify
that the others made the number of the ship.  I turned to the right place in the signal book;
presently all the flags flew out together, it was but for an instant.  The first mate rapidly
turned over the pages.

"I feared so from the first," he exclaimed; "the captain cannot refuse to let me go, she is
the `Iris.'  The pirates have a current against them, or they would have made faster progress.
We'll get on board before them yet.  Who will volunteer, lads?"

Several of the men replied, "I'm ready!"

We hurried aft, and he entreated the captain to let him have the whale boat.  At first I thought
the captain was going to refuse.

"We may still hope to be up in time to attack the prahus, and they will not long stand the
fire from our guns," he answered.  "I don't like to risk your life and those of the people
you may take with you."

"I'll take care that we are not caught by them, and I hope that we shall get on board before
they can reach the ship," said the first mate.

"Remember, Radburn, the lives of the boat's crew are committed to your charge, and though I
shall be glad to help Captain Bingley, you must turn back rather than risk an encounter in
the boat with the pirates."

"I will do as you order, sir," answered Uncle Jack, eagerly springing to the falls and singing
out for volunteers.

The captain, however, would positively allow only four hands to go, including Ned and Bell,
another Englishman, and a Malay.  I entreated that I might accompany him, and Blyth volunteered.
The captain gave me leave, though Uncle Jack hesitated.  Several more of the men came aft.

"It cannot be," said the captain, "we must keep hands enough to fight the brig."

While the boat was being lowered, arms were collected; each man stuck a brace of pistols in
his belt, and we had muskets, cutlasses, and several pikes.  The captain would not allow us
to take more, observing justly that they might be required on board the brig.  We really had
no reason to complain of his readiness to assist out friends.  Not a minute had elapsed before
we were ready, and getting out the oars away we pulled, the first mate, of course, steering.

We steered slightly to the south as the current was setting north, which of course made the
distance longer.  I could not help confessing to myself that it was very doubtful whether we
should reach the ship before the prahus.

While the mate steered, Blyth and I employed ourselves in loading the arms.  Our men pulled
as hard as they could bend their backs to the oars.  They believed that if we could once gain
the ship's deck, that we should succeed in driving back the pirates as well as we had done
on board the brig.  We could not tell whether we had been seen from the prahus, but those on
board the ship would, we hoped, make out the signal hoisted at the mast-head of the "Lily,"
that a boat was coming to their assistance, and that this would encourage them to defend themselves
should they be attacked before we could reach them.  I had never before felt the intense anxiety
I now experienced, and I knew how Uncle Jack must be feeling.

We were now rapidly nearing both the leading prahus and the ship, and we could even distinguish
the fighting men on the decks of the former, with their gingalls and muskets or spears in their
hands, though we could not make out whether they had any guns in their bows.

Captain Bingley had laughed at our carrying so many guns, and Uncle Jack said that when the
"Iris" sailed she had only two six-pounders for firing signals.  Whether others had afterwards
been shipped he could not tell; even the two small ones it was possible might have been hove
overboard to lighten the ship.

As I before said the tide was rising, and we remarked that the "Iris" had lifted considerably
since we left the brig.  I need not say that I very often turned my eyes towards the "Lily"
to see if she was moving faster than before.  Though still gliding on through the smooth water,
it was at a slow pace.  Already the leading prahus were within a quarter of a mile of the ship,
when their crews ceased rowing.  In a short time we saw that it was only to allow some of the
others to come up, apparently that they might make their attack together.  The delay was of
advantage to us.  We were near enough to see our friends, who had been anxiously watching us,
waving signals from the forecastle.  They of course knew who we were.  I thought I saw two
female dresses.  I could hardly be mistaken.  But presently they disappeared; probably Captain
Bingley had ordered his wife and daughter below to be out of the way of any missiles the pirates
might discharge.

"We shall do it, we shall do it.  Give way, my fine lads!" cried Uncle Jack; and the crew pulled
until I feared they might spring their oars.

We had another danger to encounter, that of running on any intervening coral reefs, and the
first mate stood up that he might obtain as far a view as possible ahead.  I had been so engaged
in watching the prahus, that I had not for some minutes looked at the brig.

"Hurrah!"  I shouted, "she's got the breeze at last, and is coming on bravely."

"Thank heaven!" exclaimed Uncle Jack.

At that moment the fighting men on board two of the prahus, which had again got ahead of the
others, began firing away at the ship.  Not a shot was returned from her.  This made me fear
that she had no means of defence.  On we dashed; even now we might be on board before the prahus
got alongside.  We were, it should be understood, approaching on the port bow, towards which,
for obvious reasons, the mate had steered.  The next instant we had hooked on, ladders and
ropes were lowered down to enable us to get on board.

"Hoist in the boat, or the pirates may get her!"  I heard Captain Bingley shout out.

She was dropped under the davits.  We found only, besides Captain Bingley and the mates, half
a dozen of the men with firearms, the others had either pikes or boat-hooks, or such weapons
as might serve for a hand-to-hand tussle, but could not have prevented the pirates from boarding.
We had no time to ask questions, for two of the prahus were almost alongside; hurrying across
the deck, we stood with our muskets pointed at them, telling Ned to shout in a loud voice and
threaten them with a fearful retribution should they attack us.  As they still came on we fired
a well-aimed volley at the two nearest, bringing several of their warriors to the deck, while
we quickly again loaded.  In another instant they might have been attempting to clamber up
the sides of the ship, when the people on board the other prahus saw the approach of the brig,
which almost immediately opened fire with her long gun run out through her bow port.  A panic
on this seized most of the fleet, and pulling round away they went, leaving their leaders to
their fate.  The latter seeing themselves deserted, cast off and pulled away with all their
might, their object being to avoid the which continued firing her long gun as fast as it could
be loaded.  We and the crew of the "Iris" raised a loud cheer as we saw that we had driven
off our foes.  Though we had had happily but little fighting, Uncle Jack had no doubt by his
promptitude saved the ship from being boarded, when in a few minutes every one belonging to
her might have been put to death.

Captain Bingley, hurrying up to Uncle Jack and grasping his hand, exclaimed--

"You have saved our lives, Radburn.  I thank you from my heart, and there are those below who
desire to thank you too."

He then thanked Blyth and me, and our boat's crew, who undoubtedly deserved it from the way
they had pulled.

I found that a cable had been carried out astern, and that preparations had been made for hauling
off the ship at high water, which, as the sea had remained perfectly calm, the captain hoped
to do without her having suffered material damage.  She was now rapidly regaining her perpendicular
position, and in a few minutes would be on an even keel. The brig, after following the pirates
for a short distance, had hove to Captain Haiselden had no fancy for running in among the rocks.

Jack Radburn was soon on deck.  "They are all right, I am thankful to say," he observed to
me; "they want to thank you and Mr Blyth as soon as you can go below, for coming to their assistance."

By this time, the tide having risen, the ship was once more perfectly upright.  The capstan
palls were shipped, away we tramped round and round, straining every nerve.  In vain we hove,
the cable was strained to its utmost, but not an inch did we move.  I saw the captain and his
mates making long faces as if they thought that the ship was irretrievably lost.  Uncle Jack
cheered on the men.  Already all the water had been started, and some of the heavy part of
the cargo.

"Never fear, lads," he shouted, "we must heave a few more packages overboard if we don't move
soon; but try again, lads, try again."

We pressed against the capstan bars with all our might.  Just then I felt her start.

"She moves, she moves!" burst from every mouth.

I shall never forget the delight we felt.  Round went the capstan bars. Again and again we cheered.

We were dragging her off, it must be understood, stern first, exactly as she had come on, so
that had any coral points existed they must have been torn away.  By persevering, in a few
minutes she was afloat; and by means of a hawser secured to the cable, it was brought round
to the bows, and the ship rode safely at anchor.

CHAPTER SIX.

On finding the ship afloat the crew in their joy shook hands all round. There was enough work,
however, to be done.  The carpenter first sounded the well.

No more water than usual was found in her.  It was hoped, therefore, that she had not received
any material damage.  We had, however, to get up the topmasts and topgallant-masts, the yards
across, to weigh the anchors and guns, which had been hove overboard, and no end of other work
to accomplish.

We had not been long at anchor before the "Lily," furling sails, brought up a short distance
outside of us, and Captain Haiselden with a boat's crew came on board.  In spite of the hot
sun, we worked hard all day, Uncle Jack, as may be supposed, setting us a good example.  Grace,
though pale from the alarm she had endured, was as blooming as ever. "Why, I shouldn't have
known you," she said, looking at me and coming up to shake hands; "Mamma and I are so grateful
to you for the assistance you brought us."

She also thanked Mr Blyth in the same way, I saw that her eye was ranging over the deck in
search of Uncle Jack, who was working as hard as any of the men to get the ship to rights.

As the weather was fine we remained at anchor during the night, keeping a very bright look-out
lest the pirates might come back; but impressed with the idea that the brig was a Dutch man-of-war,
without dreaming of again attacking us, they were probably making the best of their way to
the northward, to escape the pursuit they expected.  By evening the next day the ship was all
ataunto.  Captain Haiselden, who had returned to the "Lily," again came on board to hold a
consultation as to our future proceedings.  The "Iris," having started most of her water, had
before she could venture any distance from the land to procure a fresh supply. The island on
which she had been so nearly wrecked afforded none.  The nearest places at which it certainly
could be obtained were either at Banda, to the west, or the coast of New Guinea to the east,
which was still much nearer.

Captain Bingley proposed sailing west for Banda, but when Captain Haiselden told him that we
had on board a man belonging to the "Amphion," who stated that she had not been wrecked in
the way described by Howlett and Trinder, but had been driven on the shore of a large island
to the eastward, he exclaimed--

"Then, after all, that may have been the remains of the `Amphion' herself, which we fancied
we saw not a week ago, driven in among the rocks on the coast of New Guinea."

He told us that the current had carried the "Iris" in with the coast much closer than he intended
to go; while endeavouring to haul off, under a press of sail, one of the hands aloft declared
that he saw what looked like a vessel with her masts gone, inside a reef over which she must
have been driven.  The mates had both gone aloft.  The one agreed that the man was right, the
other, who looked as the first had done, through a telescope, declaring that "although very
like the shattered hull of a ship, it was only a rock of a peculiar shape."  As the safety
of the "Iris" depended upon her clawing off the shore, it had been impossible to make any further
examination, and he had been inclined to think that those who fancied they had seen a wreck
were mistaken.  At all events, if any of her crew had escaped on shore, he was not in a position
to render them any assistance.  I watched Uncle Jack's countenance as Captain Bingley was speaking.
I guessed what was passing in his mind, though he said nothing then.

"I wouldn't have passed a spot where I thought our countrymen were in slavery without trying
to help them," he remarked to me shortly afterwards.  "We must go there, Harry, if Captain
Bingley refuses to come; our captain will I am sure do his best to visit the spot.  I don't
blame Captain Bingley, with his wife and daughter on board, for not making the attempt to ascertain
if that was really a wreck, though he might have got a safe offing and then sent in a boat."

When Captain Bingley heard of the possibility of the wreck being the "Amphion," he at once
agreed to accompany the "Lily" to the neighbourhood of the spot, and to make every effort to
try and rescue any of the crew who might be found on shore.

I rather suspect Grace and Mrs Bingley being present greatly influenced him.  Not to run the
risk of remaining at anchor in so dangerous a place another night, we returned on board the
"Lily," when both the brig and ship made sail to the north-east, a course which would carry
us close to where the wreck had been seen.

According to the charts, not far off was a bay which had been visited by ships, where abundance
of good water could be found.  It was agreed, should we discover a harbour, where it was said
one existed, that we would anchor within it and send the boats along the coast to the neighbourhood
of the wreck.

On the morning of the fourth day after the "Iris" had been got afloat, land was sighted on
the starboard bow, as also right ahead, extending from the east a considerable distance to
the west, forming apparently a point running out from New Guinea.

Captain Bingley made a signal that the wreck was somewhere abreast of us, but he advised that
we should stand into the harbour as proposed. Approaching nearer we made out several channels
apparently between islands, inside of which we might at all events find good anchorage. Captain
Haiselden offered to lead the way, and shortening sail, with the lead going, we stood on.

The water was deep, the hills rising on either side of us covered with the richest vegetation.
Rounding a point we presently found ourselves in a beautiful land-locked harbour, from the
sandy shore of which rose heights, covered like the island with fine trees of varied foliage,
while a glittering cascade falling from above formed a bright stream which made its way into
the bay.

Having brought up as agreed on, we fired a gun, and Uncle Jack pulled off in the whale boat
to pilot in the "Iris," which had hove to outside. In a short time we had the satisfaction
of seeing her rounding the point, and she brought up near us.  As she by this time had almost
exhausted her stock of water, her boats and ours went in to obtain a supply.  Hitherto no natives
had been seen, but in case any should make their appearance, we had a guard with loaded muskets
ready to protect the watering party.  It occurred to us that had there been any natives in
the neighbourhood the sound of our gun, which reverberated loudly among the hills, might have
kept them at a distance.  The operation of watering occupied us for the greater part of the
day, and it was agreed that it was too late to set off in the boats until the following morning.
In the meantime every preparation was made for the proposed expedition.

The chart, which was very imperfect, helped us but little, but by Captain Bingley's calculations
the wreck was about twenty miles to the southward, which might take us, should the weather
continue favourable, five or six hours to reach.  We were to go on shore at the most convenient
landing-place we could find to the northward of the spot, and try and open up a communication
with any of the natives we might see, not knowing whether they might prove utter savages or
semi-civilised, like the Malay tribes inhabiting many of the islands in the neighbourhood.
We were to carry goods of various descriptions, axes and knives and coloured cloth, as well
as beads and rings and looking-glasses.

I scarcely slept a wink during my watch below, thinking of the possibility of meeting with
my father before the next day was over.  I was to accompany Uncle Jack in the whale boat, in
which as usual Ned and Bell were to pull.  Our jolly-boat, under the charge of the boatswain,
with Blyth, was also to come, and Captain Bingley agreed to accompany us in his long boat with
a well-armed crew of six hands.  We should thus muster pretty strong, and we might hope should
the natives not prove friendly to keep them in awe.  At daylight the following morning we started
on our expedition.  As there was a light breeze in our favour we were able to make sail, and
to run down the coast, keeping within half a mile of the shore.  It was generally rock-bound,
but here and there were sandy bays, beyond which appeared a dense vegetation, a number of lofty
trees rising above the brushwood.  Sometimes we caught sight of bright streams making their
way to the ocean, showing that the land was well watered.  In the distance rose hills, many
of considerable elevation, covered with trees almost to their summits.  Altogether the country
had a most attractive appearance.  We wished that it could become the abode of civilised people,
instead of the debased savages who were now said to inhabit it.  After we had stood on for
about twenty miles we began eagerly to look out for the wreck, but dark rocks alone met our
view, some at a considerable distance from the land, others apparently joined to it.

"I fear that Captain Bingley must, after all, have been mistaken, for I see no signs of the
wreck," I observed.

"We will stand on to the southward, however; he may easily have been deceived as to distance,"
answered Uncle Jack.

We had run on another mile or more when, looking back, I saw an object which seemed to me like
the shattered hull of a ship.  It had been previously hidden by the rocks along which we were
coasting, and in a few minutes it would again have been concealed by a high ledge.

"Can that be the wreck?"  I exclaimed, pointing it ought to Uncle Jack.

"No doubt about it," he answered, and he hailed Captain Bingley and Crowfoot.

We lowered our sails, and held a consultation as to how we could best approach the wreck, for
such all hands agreed that it was.  Uncle Jack accounted for the probability of its not having
been seen by passing prahus, by its being concealed by the ledge, although visible over it
from the mast-head of a ship.  As there appeared to be an opening between the northern and
southern ledges with clear water, Uncle Jack proposed to pull in, while the other boats, should
he discover a passage, might follow.  This was agreed to, and we steered in for the opening,
Ned standing up in the bows, with a boat-hook in his hand, to watch for any sunken rocks, and
to shove off should we come suddenly upon one.  We found the water deeper than we expected,
which accounted for the ship being driven in thus far without striking, while the ledges outside
afterwards protected her from the seas which, during south-westerly gales, must have beaten
on the coast.  We found, however, that we could not get nearer.

"That's her; I have no doubt about it," exclaimed Ned, as we came full in sight of the wreck.

"I believe he is right," said Uncle Jack, as he surveyed the remains of the ship--"she is,
I should judge, about the size of the `Amphion.'"

We first tried to pull up towards her on the western side, but it being low water, so many
rocks over which the boat could not pass intervening, we attempted to get round the south-eastern
end of the ledge on which she lay, in the hope of finding deep water inside, between her and
the land.  In this we were not disappointed, and we found that there was a channel, an eighth
of a mile wide, of deep water running between her and the beach.  On ascertaining this, we
pulled back near enough to the entrance, and made a signal for the other boats to come in.
The whale boat again leading, we rounded the point and were not disappointed in finding that
we could get sufficiently near the wreck to enable us, by scrambling over some rocks, to climb
on board.  Her masts were gone, the greater part of her upper works had been torn away, and
I should not myself have recognised her as the once trim ship my father had commanded.  Ned,
however, who visited the forecastle, declared positively that she was the "Amphion," pointing
out several marks on the bunks and the heel of the bowsprit.

She had been completely gutted, not an article remaining in her, while attempts had been made
apparently to set her on fire.  This made us conjecture that she had been visited by Malay
pirates, or perhaps by the Papuans from the neighbouring shore, though we saw no canoes by
which they might have crossed over.  The important point was thus settled, we had found the
wreck of the "Amphion."  We had next to ascertain if any of the crew survived.

We could see, however, no natives nor habitations of any sort.  This might be accounted for
from the fact that, for some distance inside the rocks the country was destitute of streams,
and that the vegetation was much less luxuriant than in other parts we had before passed. 
We had now to determine whether to go further south, or to pull back and land as we had before
intended, at the first place where native or other huts could be seen.  As we had met with
few habitations to the north, and had the greater part of the day before us, it was finally
settled to sail further south.  From Ned's account he had, after being cast on shore, been
carried in that direction.  We got out by the way we had come in, and then again making sail
glided on for six or seven miles, when we came off the mouth of a river.  Ned at once recognised
the place, and said that he remembered a village a short way from the entrance. Accordingly,
lowering our sails we pulled towards it.  As the water was smooth, we had no difficulty in
entering the river.  Mangrove trees lined the shores on either side, but after pulling for
about a mile, we came to openings, when trees of various sorts appeared.  Shortly afterwards
we saw on the right bank a number of huts, perched, like those of Borneo, on the tops of high
poles, with ladders leading up to them.  These, however, stood not on the shore, but on a level
bank actually in the water.  They were connected with each other by long bridges.  The roofs
were shaped like boats, bottom upwards.  The poles were very irregular, some being twisted,
others forked, while the buildings themselves had a dilapidated appearance.  The walls were
composed, as far as we could judge, of large mats, which, from the way they were secured, must
have allowed a free circulation of air.  Under the eaves of many of the houses we saw hung
up several human skulls, which we supposed were those of enemies killed in war, but were, we
afterwards found, the craniums of deceased relatives.  Access to the shore from the village
was obtained by a single wooden bridge.  Hitherto we had seen no inhabitants, though we had
no doubt some must have been in their houses, for we observed three or four canoes made fast
to the posts below.  Not to alarm them, we landed at a little distance where the depth of water
enabled us to approach the bank, and taking ashore several of the articles we had brought for
bartering, placed some before us, and held others up in our hands.  As we kept our weapons
concealed, our proceedings had the desired effect.  In a few minutes a man's face with a huge
mop-like head of frizzly hair appeared from behind one of the mats, then another and another.
The first made his way along the bridge leading to the bank, stopping every now and then as
if he doubted his own discretion in thus approaching us.  Our friendly signs encouraged him,
and he came on with less hesitation, followed by women of all ages, who now came out of the
huts.  The men were fine-looking fellows, their heads frizzled out in the most extraordinary
manner.  The men were employed while watching us in "forking out"--for I cannot call it combing--their
heads of hair with large wooden forks having four or five prongs.  They wore earrings and necklaces
made of white beads or kangaroo teeth.  The earrings consisted of thick silver-wire hoops,
some of the women having the ends of their necklaces attached to them, and then looped up into
a sort of "chignon" behind.  The men wore a great number of ornaments composed of the teeth
of small animals, and they had finger rings as well as necklaces and bracelets.  Some wore
bands round their arms, ornamented with bunches of varied-coloured feathers.  Others also had
on anklets in the form of hoops made of shell, or brass wire, below the knee.

Ned and Charley were now told to try if they could make themselves understood, and to say that
we had come as friends to trade with them and to give them all sorts of articles in exchange
for the productions of their country, and then to inquire whether they had no white men among
them.  First Ned addressed them, then Charley.  It was pretty evident, however, that the Papuans
did not understand a word that was said.  We therefore tried what signs would do, and succeeded
much better.  Having come up to us, they examined the articles we had placed on the ground,
when the chief man among them sent back several of the others to the village, who returned
laden with mats and baskets, some empty, others full of a white flour, which on examination
we found to be sago.

Also baskets of yams, taro, bananas, and other roots, cocoa-nuts, fruits, and oranges.  We
saw, indeed, a large number of cocoa-nut trees growing in the neighbourhood.  We now offered
them such of the goods as we had brought as we considered equivalent to the various lots.

Our trading had hitherto gone on well, and we hoped soon thoroughly to gain the confidence
of the natives, and be able to make the inquiries we desired.

Kalong had come with us, and as he could not understand us, we told Ned to get him to try what
he could do.

We watched him eagerly.  After a time the Papuans appeared to understand what he was saying,
they replied.  He then turned and repeated what they had said to Ned, who told us that the
Papuans acknowledged that some white men had been living with them for some time, but that
they had been carried off by another tribe, who had come far away from the northward, at some
distance from the coast.  Before this they had made several attempts to escape, and were building
a canoe for the purpose, when the enemy came down and made them prisoners.

Kalong was then directed to inquire what sort of people they were.  I listened eagerly for
Ned's interpretation; at last he said--

"One was a chief, who notwithstanding worked as willingly, or more so, than any of the rest,
and seemed more anxious than they were to get away."

This description made me hope that it was my father of whom the Papuan spoke, but I was bitterly
disappointed to hear that he had been carried to a distance, as it might still be long before
we could find him. Uncle Jack felt as I did.

"We must, notwithstanding, keep up our spirits, Harry," he said; "there's no proof that he
has lost his life, and as these savages don't move far from their locations, we may soon have
a chance of communicating with him.  We must try and get our friends here to help us, and the
promise of a large reward may incite their wits and courage. Having succeeded thus far we will
not give up the search, and if we can get one of these frizzly-pated gentlemen to act as our
guide we will set off at once to look for him."

Uncle Jack explained his plans to Captain Bingley.

"I should like to make every effort in my power to recover my friend Musgrave, but I dare not
risk the loss of any of my people in making the attempt," he answered.

"Then with your leave, Captain Bingley, I will go alone!" exclaimed Uncle Jack.  "Who will
volunteer?  Ned, I am sure that you will be ready to go and look after your old captain."

"Aye, aye, sir," was the answer, "with all my heart."

"And I'll go too," said Bell, who had an eye to trade, and an idea that he might establish
an intercourse with the natives, as he had done in Borneo.

Kalong, on being asked, expressed his readiness, provided that we all went well-armed.

"I'll join you," said Blyth; "I am sure Captain Haiselden will not object."

The next point to be arranged was, in the event of our finding my father, where should we rejoin
the brig.

Captain Bingley, after some discussion, promised, concluding that Captain Haiselden would agree
with him, to run down the coast, and to stand off and on, so as to be ready to take us on board.
The appearance of the two vessels would, he hoped, produce a favourable effect on the natives.
Uncle Jack thanked him heartily, and agreed that the plan was the best that could be devised.
I had hoped that Captain Bingley, on hearing of the possibility of my father being in the neighbourhood,
would have marched with our whole force to rescue him, but he observed that so large a party
might make the natives suspect that we had come as enemies, whereas a small force would show
that we had no hostile intentions, and induce them to behave in a friendly manner towards us.

Blyth now told Ned to inform the natives, through Kalong, that we should be ready to purchase
all the sago they could obtain, as well as a small quantity of cocoa-nuts, yams, and other
roots or fruits, promising to call for them before we left the coast.  The natives, who seemed
fully to enter into the spirit of trade, were highly satisfied, and undertook to do as they
were advised.

Blyth said that if we could open up a trade with them it might lead to a commercial intercourse
with other tribes along the coast, and ultimately, he hoped, to the civilisation of the country;
observing, "If we can show the natives that we wish to be friendly, and treat them with justice,
we shall render them service while we benefit ourselves."

As Captain Bingley was anxious to get back before nightfall, his and the boatswain's boats
started on their return, leaving Uncle Jack, Blyth, and me with the three men to carry out
our proposed undertaking.

CHAPTER SEVEN.

We felt pretty well satisfied of the friendly intentions of the natives, but Uncle Jack considered
that it would be prudent to be on our guard, and directed us all to keep close together.  We
feared, from the long discussion held by the natives, that we should find a difficulty in obtaining
guides, none of them being willing to encounter the dangers they expected to meet with.  We
told Kalong to offer a handsome payment to each man who would accompany us, and at length two
fine young fellows stepped forward and agreed to go.  They would not, however, consent to start
until the following morning at daybreak.  They offered one of their huts that we might rest
in it at night.  We selected one which overhung the stream, so that we might secure our boat
beneath and retreat to it if necessary.  The inhabitants of the hut, who had no heavy articles
of furniture to remove, at once cleared out and gave us possession.

As evening approached we saw them cooking in large earthen bowls. Supper consisted of yams,
vegetables, fish, and pork, some dishes being seasoned with cocoa-nut, finely shred over them,
and all very well cooked.  This showed us that the natives were not the savages they have so
generally been represented to be, and the hospitable treatment we received gave us confidence
that they intended to act honestly.

Night passed away quietly, and the next morning, after a further supply of cooked provisions
had been brought us, our two guides said that they were ready to start.  They told Kalong that
they intended to row along the coast some distance to the eastward, where there was a bay in
which we could land, and from thence proceed directly towards a village perched on the side
of a mountain, where the white men had been living when last heard of.

We agreed at once to embark.  Pulling down the river, for there was no wind for sailing, we
steered as the natives directed.  The shore, as far as we could see, was densely wooded, with
high hills, also covered with trees, rising in the far distance into lofty mountain ranges.
Here and there were openings in the forest through which we could distinguish villages, but
the natives either did not see us, or supposed that the whale boat was one of their own canoes.

At all events we were not followed.  We had rowed fifteen and twenty miles when our pilots
pointed to an opening on the shore, off which we had arrived.  A short distance ahead we saw
lying off the coast a small island thickly covered with trees.  Eager to land, scarcely giving
it a second glance, we pulled in for the bay the natives pointed out.  As we approached we
observed near the beach a number of houses similar to those of our friends, and fully expected
to encounter fresh difficulties with the natives, but on getting nearer we saw no one moving about.

We told Kalong to ask whether the people were likely to prove friendly or not.  After consulting
with our guides he answered that the huts were deserted, the whole of the inhabitants having
been carried off by a fleet of prahus which lately visited the coast.

On landing we found that this account was correct.  Looking out for some thick underwood we
dragged up our whale boat on the beach, and so concealed her that she could not be seen by
strangers entering the bay. We now prepared for our march.  We each of us carried, besides
our arms and ammunition, some biscuits, tea, and sugar, a small bale of goods consisting of
coloured cloth, axes, knives, beads, and glittering ornaments likely to suit the savage taste.

Ned and Charley had, besides, our simple cooking utensils.  We felt sure of obtaining game
enough and wild fruits to enable us to fare sumptuously.

Blyth and I were in high spirits, for I felt sure ere long that we should find my father, and
I was surprised that Uncle Jack did not appear equally confident.  We found the woods as we
proceeded full of birds of magnificent plumage, parrots, cockatoos, lories, and others of exquisite
form and colour, which Blyth at once declared were birds of paradise.  They, however, kept
at such a distance that we were unable to shoot any of them had we been so disposed.  Looking
up at the top of a lofty tree we saw a large number flying backwards and forwards from branch
to branch, so that the trees appeared filled with waving plumes. We stopped for a moment to
admire them.  Their wings were raised directly over their backs.  Their heads were stretched
out, while their long hinder feathers, being elevated and expanded, formed two superb fans. 'heard who

the forest, produced, however, I believe, rather by insects and birds than by wild beasts.

Next morning, after cooking several birds which we had shot and taken our breakfast, we recommenced
our journey.  We had marched on five or six miles up a gradual ascent, differing, however,
very little from the ground we had left, when our guides informed us that we were approaching
the village for which we were bound.  Soon after we saw in the distance a large number of leaf-covered
huts stretching over a considerable extent of ground.  It was agreed that our guides should
go forward, each provided with some of the articles we had brought to present to the chief,
and to say that some white strangers had arrived who desired to become friends and to trade
with him.  We told Kalong that they must not fail to hint that we were well-armed and able
to defend ourselves, but at the same time that we were peaceably disposed.  Observing a rock
a short distance off, partly covered with trees, from which we could command a view of the
country around us, we climbed to the top of it to wait there in the shade until the return
of the two Papuans.  We employed part of the time in making a meal off the provisions which
we had cooked in the morning.  How eagerly I looked out for our guides, expecting to see them
perhaps accompanied by my father.  We waited and waited, but still nowhere could we discover
them.  At length, a large portion of the day having passed, we saw a person hurrying towards
us, and as he began to climb the rock we perceived that he was one of our Papuan friends. 
His countenance showed that he was greatly agitated. We anxiously waited until Kalong and Ned
could interpret for us.

"He brings bad news, sir," said Ned, at length; "from what I can make out, the savages have
seized his companion, and he had a hard job to get away from them.  He says that some of the
white men are dead, and that the others, not long ago, made their escape.  This made the people
very savage, and he fears if we go near them that they will seize and keep us instead."

"But, my father!  Do you make out that he has escaped?"  I inquired eagerly.

"It is a very difficult question to answer," said Ned; "our friend here thinks that the man
whom they call the `White Chief,' and who I take it was the captain, did get away, and that
makes them so angry.  It seems that they had been very friendly with him up to that time, only
they would not let him go because he was teaching them all sorts of things. I don't suppose
if they were to make us prisoners they would kill us, but we should lose our object in coming,
and may be they would keep too strict a watch to let us escape."

We had no reason to doubt our guide; indeed, his story appeared so probable that Uncle Jack
at once resolved to beat a retreat.  If the white men had escaped, they were now probably on
the coast, and we might fall in with them.

This hope greatly softened the disappointment we should otherwise have felt.  Our native friend
seemed satisfied with our resolution.  We inquired what he intended to do with regard to his
companion.  He replied that he would not lose his life, and that he would probably some day
make his escape, and when we told him that he should have the promised reward notwithstanding
the failure of the expedition, he was evidently highly satisfied.

There was no time to be lost, as we wished to put as great a distance as possible between ourselves
and the villagers before they discovered that we had begun to retreat.  We had the advantage
of knowing the way and of a beaten track to traverse.  Our loads, too, were lightened somewhat
by the presents we had sent; at the same time Uncle Jack thought it would be imprudent to throw
the remainder away, lest they should fall into the hands of our pursuers, who would consequently
be less likely to come to terms with us, should we be overtaken.  It was dark when we reached
our camping-place.  As our guide undertook to lead us back to our boat during the night, we
continued our journey without waiting to rest.  We could see the stars through the opening
of the forest, and we knew that we were going in the right direction.  Without our native guide,
however, we could not have ventured to make the attempt.  With due thankfulness we at length
caught sight of the ocean, on which the light from a crescent moon was glittering brightly.

Our boat was safe, but it was a question whether we should launch her at once, or remain on
shore until the following morning.  As we were all pretty well tired, Uncle Jack determined
on turning her bottom up, so that we might sleep beneath her while one of us kept watch in
case any natives should approach.  We dragged her out from among the bushes, therefore, down
to the beach, just above high water mark, so that we might be able to put off quickly should
it become necessary.  Of course we could think and talk only of one subject.  What had become
of my father?

We must of course continue our search for him, and we all hoped that, unless he had escaped
on board some passing vessel, which was not at all likely, he would not be far off.

It was arranged that Blyth should keep the first watch, Uncle Jack the second, and I the third.

I never slept more soundly in my life, as I was very tired with our long tramp, for it seemed
but a moment after I lay down before I was aroused by my uncle giving me a pull by the leg
I crept out from under the boat, and shouldering my musket began to pace up and down close
to the boat to keep myself awake, while my uncle took my place.

The stars were shining brightly, and a light wind rustled the leaves of the neighbouring trees,
while the water lapped gently on the beach.  No other sounds reached my ears.  I still felt
so drowsy that I was sure, should I sit down, that I should go to sleep.  Occasionally I extended
my walk to the borders of the forest.

I had made several turns, and calculated that I had been half an hour or so on watch, when
it appeared to me that the night was growing darker, and looking up I saw that the stars overhead
were obscured, while the murmuring sound in the trees had increased in loudness; though sheltered
as we were by the forest we did not feel the wind, which was blowing off shore.  The clouds
continued gathering until the whole sky was obscured. I fully expected before long that there
would be a downpour of rain, but as we were on a weather shore I did not think it necessary
to call my companions.  I continued my walk, occasionally approaching the forest and then returning
to the boat.

I looked out anxiously for the approach of day, but even had the sky been clear, the trees
would have prevented me from seeing the first streaks of dawn, and as it was the sun itself
would probably not be visible.

At last I knew by the light that the day had broke.  I had gone back to the forest, and intended
to arouse my companions at the end of the next turn, when I fancied that I could distinguish
the sound of human voices amid the soughing of the wind in the branches overhead.  Stooping
down to the ground I listened attentively--I was sure I was not mistaken.

The voices might be those of the natives, who finding we had retreated had pursued us.  Hurrying
back to the boat as quickly as I could, I roused up Uncle Jack, telling him what I had heard.

"Very likely you are right, Harry," he answered, "though we might drive back the savages, we
could not do so without bloodshed, and our safest plan will be to get our boat off and hold
a parley with them from her. If they show hostility, we can keep them at bay until we get to
a safe distance."

Without a moment's delay we called up our companions.  We quickly turned the boat on her keel
and ran her down into the water.  We two held her, while the rest carried our goods on board.

Just as we were jumping in we saw a number of savages, armed with spears and bows, emerging
from the forest, and they, catching sight of us, rushed forward, others following, until a
formidable band was collected on the beach.

"Shove off, lads!" cried the first mate, seizing an oar, and the rest of us imitating his example,
aided by the wind, we speedily drove the boat away from the shore.

The savages, seeing us about to escape them, bent their bows and let fly a shower of arrows,
which came whistling about our ears, some falling in the boat and others on either side.

The first mate steered, Blyth sat by his side with a musket in his hand ready to fire, while
our Papuan guide crouched down in the stern-sheets.

"Shall I fire?" asked Blyth, "I can knock over one of those fellows; the chief, I suspect,
who seems to be leading them on."

"No, hold fast, I would not injure the poor wretches if it can be avoided," answered the first
mate.  "We shall be out of their reach in another minute.  We can then settle how to treat
with them."

A few strokes took us beyond the range of their missiles.  He was right, for their bows were
comparatively small, intended rather to shoot birds than for war, while their javelins could
not be thrown to any great distance.

He now directed Ned to tell Kalong to address them, and to say that we had come with friendly
intentions to trade, and to recover some countrymen who had been wrecked on their coast.

The chief, on hearing this, invited us on shore, observing that we could talk more easily there,
and that he would hear what we had to say.

The Malay and our native guide talked together.

"Kalong says we had better not trust them," observed Ned; "if we land they may shoot us for
the sake of getting our goods.  They don't know how far our firearms can reach.  Better give
them a volley to show them."

This Uncle Jack was unwilling to do, though we might have shot down half a dozen of them at
least, had we fired as Ned proposed.

While this palaver was going forward I took a glance seaward, when what was my astonishment
to see the "Iris" and "Lily" standing along the coast, under close reefed topsails, as if coming
to look for us.  I could judge by the way they heeled over that a pretty strong breeze was
blowing in the offing.

If we were to get on board there was no time to lose; indeed, it seemed very doubtful whether
we could reach either of the vessels.  They were too far off to see us, and it was doubtful
whether they could hear our muskets.  Uncle Jack directed Blyth and me to fire at the same
time, but neither the ship nor the brig altered their course.  They had good reason for not
wishing to approach the land, as the wind, rapidly increasing, was shifting to the north-west,
and they might at any moment find themselves on a lee shore.  They had also got so far from
the harbour they had left that it was evident that they could not manage to get back.

"They'll not desert us, lads, depend upon that," said Uncle Jack, as we saw them standing away
from the coast; "we can neither overtake them nor land while those fellows on shore show so
unfriendly a disposition.  We must try and get back to the village where we procured our guides,
though I don't know what sort of reception we shall meet with when their friends hear that
we have lost one of them.  It will be a long pull and a heavy one, for we shall have a head
sea as soon as we get clear of this bay."

"Why not then make for yonder island to the eastward?"  I observed. "These savages, who don't
appear to have any canoes, cannot follow us there, and we shall be able to remain in safety
until our friends come to take us off."

"We may have to follow your suggestion, Harry, but we must first try to get back to the river
to land our guide according to our promise.  He has proved faithful, and we will supply him
with goods with which he may be able to ransom his companion."

This was said as we were pulling out of the bay, but no sooner did we get beyond the point
than we met so heavy a sea that it was impossible to pull the whale boat against it, and we
were in danger of being swamped.  Our only alternative was, as I proposed, to run for the island.
Even now we had to pull hard to avoid the following seas which threatened to poop us.  We saw
the savages on shore dancing, shouting, and gesticulating when they discovered that we had
escaped them.  On finding, however, that we were steering for the island they rushed along
the beach in the same direction, which made us fear that they might possess the means of crossing
over to it, and that after all we should have to fight for our lives.  We had not much apprehension,
however, as to the result.  Uncle Jack intended to pull round to the lee side of the island,
and then, should they persist in attacking us, we could shoot them down from the boat while
we kept out of range of their arrows.

As we pulled along we watched the two vessels which were getting further and further from the
coast, although the ship had only her fore and mizen topsail set, and the brig was under equally
snug canvas.

Aided by the wind the boat went faster than the savages could run, and they were out of sight
when we reached the passage between the island and the main land.  We could see no canoes on
the shore, and this made us hope that we might at all events avoid an attack until the gale
was over, and we could resume our search for my father.

We did not doubt for a moment that the "Lily" would come to look for us, and by hoisting a
signal on the outer end of the island we hoped to attract her attention.  Passing through the
channel, which was about a mile wide, we rounded the eastern point of the island where the
water was perfectly smooth, when discovering a small bay with a sandy beach we at once pulled
in.  As we saw no huts or plantations we calculated that the island was uninhabited.  We therefore
landed without hesitation, and hauled up our boat.  From a rocky elevation on the northern
side of the bay we could command a view of the main land along the whole length of the strait.

Uncle Jack sent Blyth and me to watch should any natives appear, but sharp as were our eyes
we could discover neither canoes nor human beings moving about.

The savages therefore supposing we had escaped had, we concluded, returned to their village.
As there was some probability that we should have to remain several days on the island, Uncle
Jack proposed that we should build a hut, which would be a pleasanter sleeping-place than under
the boat.  We at once therefore set to work.

The Papuan showed himself an adept at the use of the axe, and understanding clearly what we
wanted was of great assistance.  A bamboo thicket and some large palm leaves afforded us materials,
so that in a short time we had a well built hut erected capable of containing all the party,
the upper floor affording us a sleeping-place, while the lower would shelter us during the
day should it come on to rain.  We naturally felt much anxiety about the vessels, though we
trusted that they would avoid any of the dangers which lay to the westward.

Night passed without any adventure.  The gale raged with unabated fury, though we felt it but
little in our sheltered cove.  We had brought a good store of provisions and a breaker of water
in the boat, but that, from the frequent applications to it, was almost exhausted.  It was
necessary to search for a fresh supply.  Uncle Jack was unwilling to leave the beach in case
the natives might find the means of crossing. Blyth and I therefore undertook to go in search
of water.  We hoped, although we might not discover a stream--which from the size of the island
was unlikely--we might find a spring, or ground by digging into which fresh water might be
reached.  As soon, therefore, as we had breakfasted we set off.  As we had pulled along it
the previous day we calculated that the island was between three and four miles long and about
two miles broad.

Besides our guns we each carried a long bamboo stick, one end pointed and the other formed
like a gouge to serve as a spade, with which we might dig for water, should we fail to find
a stream.

So thick was the jungle immediately at the back of the cove that we had to proceed along the
shore some distance before we could make our way inland.  In several places we found it lined
with the pandanus or screw palm, which looks as if it had branches at both ends, the lower
being the roots which had lifted the trunk into the air.  In other places there were cocoa-nut
trees with nuts hanging from them, so we knew that even were we to be kept there many weeks
we should have an ample supply of vegetable diet.

"We shall find other food too," said Blyth, pointing to some trees which grew in a hollow at
the foot of a hill.  "Those are sago trees; if hard pressed we might manufacture sufficient
sago from them to last us for months, or even years.  They require moisture, and I have little
doubt that by digging we shall find water not far from their roots.  But we will search further,
perhaps we may discover a spring which will give us a more ample supply, so that there is no
fear of our starving.  What a number of birds there are!  Many of them, too are birds of paradise.
I cannot tell you their names, but they seem to be the same as are found in the Aru islands
away to the southward.  We shall have no difficulty in shooting them, or some of those magnificent
pigeons when we want them, but it would be a pity to expend our ammunition unnecessarily. 
We can kill a few as we return to serve us for dinner."

The whole of the island indeed appeared to be a perfect garden, and yet, as far as we could
discover, not a single inhabitant did it contain.  We made our way on, not without great difficulty,
sometimes having to cut a passage for ourselves through the underwood until we reached the
southern end, or rather western shore, where we could see the ocean still covered over with
raging foam-topped seas, which made us fear that for many days to come our friends could not
return, and until the brig did come back I was sure that Uncle Jack would consider it his duty
to remain on the island, whence he could communicate with her.

As we were more likely to find a spring inland than on the coast we continued our course up
the centre of the island.  "We shall have to dig, I suspect, after all, in the sago grove,"
said Blyth, as we at last began our return.  "However, we may as well carry some game with
us; I intend to shoot the first fine pigeon I see.  You can try your luck, although I would
advise you not to fire unless you feel sure of your aim."

In a short time Blyth, who was a good shot, killed three or four pigeons, and I had shot a
parrot and a bird of paradise, but I felt ashamed at having deprived so beautiful a creature
of life, yet thousands were flying about unseen by human eye, which they are formed to delight.
We went on a little further, when I again fired and brought down another parrot.  Just as I
pulled the trigger I caught sight between the trees of a face watching us.  At the first glance
I thought it must be some huge baboon, but still it looked human though covered thickly with
hair.  I was a little in advance of Blyth.  Supposing that if not a baboon it was a savage,
I was hurriedly reloading, ready to defend myself, when a man stepping forward exclaimed--

"Who are you mates, and where do you come from?"

For a moment my astonishment at the sudden apparition prevented me from answering.  The man,
however, advanced without fear. This thing whom snakes of Mr. Chute s whom had scarce with taste, oh!

  If your father is ill, Harry, there will be a risk in agitating him
by presenting yourself suddenly to him.  Let our friend here first tell him that he has found
some Englishmen on the island, and then I will go in and tell him that his son and brother-in-law
have come to look for him. Where is he living?" he asked of the sailor.

"In a poor enough place, sir, close on the sea shore.  It is a cave, inside a rock.  We thought
it safer than a hut, where the natives, if they had come to the island, would be more likely
to find us."

I begged the seaman to hurry on.  "What!  Are you the captain's son?" he asked, as I ran by
his side.  "Often and often he has talked about you. If anything will set him on his legs the
sight of you will."

We soon reached the beach, when scrambling for some distance among the rocks the seaman pointed
to the entrance of a cave at the side of a hill which sloped up from the water.

As agreed on the seaman went first, followed by Blyth.  I stood outside eagerly waiting to
be summoned.  It seemed so long that I was afraid my father had been overcome with the news.

At length Blyth appeared, and beckoned me in, and the next instant I was kneeling by my father's
side, as he lay stretched on a bed of leaves and matting, which Dick Meade, his faithful follower,
had arranged for him.

"What!  Are you Harry, really my son Harry?" he exclaimed, throwing his arms around my neck;
"I was sure that you and my good brother Jack Radburn would come to look for me if you thought
I was alive, and not until yesterday, when God in his mercy had sent you to this island, did
I lose hope.  Ungrateful I was, after having been preserved from so many dangers; but your
appearance has brought me back to life."

"What the captain wants is some good food," I heard Dick observe to Blyth; "if you'll let me
cook one of those pigeons it will do him all the good in the world."

As Blyth carried a flint and steel they soon had a fire lighted in a sheltered spot, just outside
the cave.  While I sat by my father I was thankful to see that he appeared stronger as we conversed.

Blyth soon again came in and volunteered to carry the joyful intelligence to Uncle Jack.  During
his absence the pigeon was cooked and eaten.  Dick brought in a shell full of water from a
spring, which he said bubbled out of the hill side close at hand.

Soon I heard Uncle Jack's voice.  I need not describe the meeting between him and my father.
He had left Blyth with directions to bring the boat round should the sea have gone down sufficiently
to enable her without risk to reach a little cove which we found not far from the cave, where
she might be hauled up if necessary.  Uncle Jack, with his usual forethought, had brought tea
and sugar and biscuit, luxuries to which my poor father had long been a stranger.  They appeared
to benefit him much.  In a few hours he was able to sit up and converse freely with us.  Before
nightfall we had the satisfaction of seeing the boat, and Dick ran down to pilot her into the
cove.  Some of the party spent the night in the cave, which was of considerable size, and others
under the boat.

The first thing all hands did in the morning was to cut down the tallest trees we could find
to form a flag-staff, which we placed on the highest part of the hill overlooking the ocean.
We then fastened together the two flags we had in the boat with a number of our handkerchiefs,
which, combined, formed a flag of a size which could be seen at a considerable distance; eagerly
we watched day after day for the appearance of sail.

I had never seen Uncle Jack so anxious, he could not help reflecting that during the gale some
accident might have happened to the "Iris," and that his dear Grace might be among the sufferers.

"Cheer up, brother Jack," said my father, when he saw him thus cast down; "I have learned more
than ever to put confidence in God's loving mercy during my exile.  Had I not been able to
trust Him, I should have sank long ago.  I have known Haiselden and Bingley all their lives,
and they are not the men to desert their friends."

Still another and another day passed.  At length, one morning, I was awakened by a shout from
Dick Meade, and running out of the cave, I saw the rising sun shining on the white canvas of
a brig in the offing. That she was the "Lily" I had no doubt, but where was the "Iris"?  What
would be Uncle Jack's feelings at not seeing her?

Dick was hoisting up the flag which he had just bent on.  The breeze was from the south-east,
which would enable the brig to approach the island without risk.  She was standing on farther
to the northward, and I began to fear that she was not the "Lily" after all.  I was expressing
my doubts to Dick, when I found Uncle Jack standing by me with a telescope to his eye.

"Yes she's the `Lily,' no doubt about it; she'll see our signal before long, as she will be
looking out for us."

In another minute the whole of our party were on foot.  I ran in to tell my father, who insisted
on coming out to have a look at the object for which his eyes had so often ached in vain.

In the meantime our men had lighted a fire, believing that a long pull would be before them.
Fortunate it was that they did so.  My father was not in a fit state to go off without breakfast.
The meal was scarcely over when the brig tacked, and the "Lily's" flag was run up at the mast-head.

Not a moment was lost in launching the boat.  My father was assisted down to the beach.  We
waited a few minutes, when the "Lily" hove to. Our last act was to lower the signal flag, and
we then, getting on board, with hearty strokes pulled away for the brig.

"We have found him, we have found him!"  I could not help calling out as we approached her side.

My father was helped on board, and warmly welcomed by our kind-hearted captain.  Uncle Jack's
first inquiry was for the "Iris."

"She's all safe at the Aru islands, where I promised to rejoin her as soon as I had recovered
you," answered Captain Haiselden; "and as she has received some damage in the gale, she is
likely to be detained there several days."

The only person who looked unhappy was our Papuan guide; but he was reassured when the captain
promised to land him at his own village, towards which we stood, as soon as the whale boat
was dropped astern.

In a couple of hours we were off the mouth of the river, when we once more pulled off, with
the same party which had before landed in the whale boat.

As we approached, a shout of joy arose from our companions.  The cause was soon explained.
One of the first persons we saw standing on the platform in front of the hut was the lost guide
who had, we afterwards found, made his escape, while his captors were pursuing us.

The natives were delighted with the things we brought them, and we could have laden our boat
up to the gunwale with the articles they offered in return.

Wishing our friends good-bye, and promising that we would as soon as possible pay them another
visit, we pulled back to the brig.

In three days we reached the Aru islands, seldom visited by English vessels, and brought up
before the chief town Dobbo, which is, however, only a collection of huts such as those described
in Papua and Borneo, though of a more substantial character.  The population of the islands
are mostly Papuans, though people from various other parts of the Eastern seas have settled
there.  The islands are generally level, and thickly wooded, the forests containing amongst
other birds two or three of the most beautiful species of birds of paradise.

The "Iris" was almost ready to sail, so that we remained there but a couple of days, when,
threading our way among the coral reefs, we once more got into the open sea.

I should have been happy to give a further description of our voyage and our visit to Timor,
where we anchored to obtain fresh provisions.  We then shaped our course along the south coast
of Java, and then, crossing the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope; after which we
had a remarkably fine passage home, and, strange to say, did not once lose sight of the "Iris."

Whether Uncle Jack had anything to do with this I can only guess.  I know that he told me to
keep a bright look-out for her whenever he was below, and report to him any change in her position.
The "Iris" led the way up the Thames.  Immediately she dropped her anchor, before going into
dock, Uncle Jack and my father went on board and arranged a plan with Grace for breaking the
news of his return to my mother; she and Mrs Bingley at once went on shore promising to act
with due discretion. I have every reason to believe they carried out their duty well, for when
I arrived at home a few hours after my father, I found my mother looking the picture of happiness,
and almost as calm and composed as usual.

I have not entered into the trading particulars of the voyages of the two vessels, but both
were considered highly satisfactory.  It was the first of several I made on board the brig
to the same region, the mate of the "Lily" being now her captain.

In the next voyage my Aunt Grace, now Uncle Jack's wife, accompanied him.  He has since retired
from the sea.  I served with him as his second, and then his first mate for some years, until
I got the command of a ship.  I must acknowledge that I greatly owe my success to having followed
the good example set me by my excellent uncle once The Mate of the "Lily."

THE END.
