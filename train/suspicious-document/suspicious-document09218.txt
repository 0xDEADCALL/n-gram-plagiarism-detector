                     IS SLAVERY SANCTIONED BY
                            THE BIBLE?

If there is one subject which, above all others, may be regarded as of national interest at
the present time, it is the subject of Slavery. Wherever we go, north or south, east or west,
at the fireside, in the factory, the rail-car or the steamboat, in the state legislatures or
the national Congress, this "ghost that will not down" obtrudes itself. The strife has involved
press, pulpit, and forum alike, and in spite of all compromises by political parties, and the
desperate attempts at non-committal by religious bodies, it only grows wider and deeper. 

The monumental Parties of who ENGLAND: a Series of Engravings of Rule, by royal Notices. With Rev.
CHARLES Norfolk, Rector. the., M of Sublimity, Armory. The attack,
containing 149 Weapons, it will be other feature of the inst. Price,
ready 8vo., cloth. On the one side, it is claimed that slavery, as it exists in
the United States, is not a moral evil; that it is an innocent and lawful relation, as much
as that of parent and child, husband and wife, or any other in society; that the right to buy,
sell, and hold men for purposes of gain, was given by express permission of God, and sanctioned
by Christ and his apostles; that this right is founded on the golden rule; and says Dr. Shannon
of Bacon College, Ky., "I hardly know which is most unaccountable, the profound ignorance of
the Bible, or the sublimity of cool impudence and infidelity manifested by those who profess
to be Christians; and yet dare affirm that the Book of God gives no sanction to slaveholding."
All these affirmations are fairly summed up thus: "As slavery was practiced by the patriarchs,
received sanction and legality from God in the Mosaic law, and was not denounced by Christ
and his apostles, it must have been right. If right then, it is so still; therefore Southern
slavery is right."

On the other hand, it is contended that chattel slavery is nowhere warranted or sanctioned
by the Bible, but is totally opposed both to its spirit and teachings.

It will be the object of the present discussion to determine which of these opinions is correct.

                      SLAVERY DEFINED.

What, then, is chattel slavery as understood in American law?

1. It is not the relation of wife or child. In one sense a man may be said to "possess" these;
but he can not buy or sell them. These are natural relations; and he who violates them for
the sake of gain is branded by all as barbarous and criminal.

2. Not the relation of apprentice or minor. This is temporary, having for its primary object,
not the good of the master or guardian, but that of the apprentice or minor, his education
and preparation for acting his part as a free and independent member of society; but chattelism
is life bondage, for the sole good of the master.

3. Not the relation of service by contract. Here a bond or agreement is implied, and therefore
reciprocal rights, and the mutual power of dissolution on failure of either in the terms of
mutual agreement; but chattelism ignores and denies the ability of the slave to make a contract.

4. Not serfdom or villeinage. The serf or villein was attached to the glebe or soil, and could
not be severed from it, deprived of his family, or sold to another as a chattel; being retained
as part of the indivisible feudal community. But the chattel slave is a "thing" incapable of
family relations, and may be sold when, where, or how the master pleases.

Chattelism is none of these relations; its principle is "property in man." Its definition is
thus given in the law of Louisiana, (Civil Code, art.

Judge Ruffin, giving the opinion of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, (case of State v.
Mann,) says a slave is "one doomed in his own person and his posterity to live without knowledge,
and without the capacity to make any thing his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits."

We now come to the point at issue: Does the Bible sanction this system?

                        OLD TESTAMENT.

                      1. Hebrew Terms.

The Hebrew terms used in reference to this subject are עָבַד, auvadh, "to serve;" the noun,
עֶבֶד, evedh, "servant" or "bondman," one contracting service for a term of years; שָּׂכִיר,
saukir, a "hired servant" daily or weekly; אָמָה, aumau, and שִׁפְחָה, shiphechau, "maid-servant"
or "handmaid;" but there is no term in Hebrew synonymous with our word slave, for all the terms
applied to servants are, as we shall show, equally applicable and applied to free persons.

The verb עָבַד, auvadh, according to Gesenius, signifies primarily, to labor; then, to labor
for one's self, for hire, or compulsory labor as a captive or prisoner of war. Gen. 2:5, 15;
3:23; 29:15. Ex. 20:9; 21:2. Next, national servitude as tributary to others; as Sodom and
the cities of the plain to Chedorlaomer, Gen. 14:4; Esau to Jacob, Gen. 25:23; the Israelites
in Canaan to surrounding nations, Moabites, Philistines, and others, Judg. 3:8; Jer. 27:7,
9. Next, national and personal servitude or serfdom, as of the Israelites in Egypt. Lastly,
the service of God or idols, Judg. 3:7, &c. From these and similar passages we see that neither
the generic nor specific meaning of the term, taken in its connections, implies chattel slavery,
but labor, voluntary, hired, or compulsory, as of tributary nations or prisoners of war, whose
claim to regain, if possible, their freedom and rights, is ever admitted and acted on; showing
that freedom is the normal state of man, subjection and compulsory servitude the abnormal and
unnatural.

But it is objected that, though the proper meaning of the verb "to serve" does not imply chattel
slavery, it is certain that the derived noun עֶבֶד, evedh, translated "servant" and "bondman"
in our version, is frequently used to designate involuntary servitude, the service of one "bought
with money," and therefore a chattel slave. We reply, By far the most frequent use of this
term, as is well known, represents either the common deferential mode of address of inferiors
to superiors, or equals to equals, used then and to-day in the East, or the political subordination
of inferior to superior rank invariably existing in Eastern governments. Otherwise we have
Jacob saying to Esau, "The children which God hath graciously given thy" slave; and Joseph's
brethren saying to him, "Thou saidst to thy slaves, Bring him down to me." "When we came up
to thy slave my father." Saul's officers and soldiers are his slaves, David is Jonathan's,
and vice versa; Abigail, David's wife, is his slave; his people, officers, and even embassadors
are all his slaves; all are slaves to each other, and none are masters, unless it be the king.

How, then, can we properly define the meaning and status of the term "servant" in any particular
passage? We answer, only by the context and the usage of the particular time and place, so
far as known.

                    2. The Curse of Canaan.

We first meet with the term "servant" in the oft-disputed passage, Gen. 9:25-27: "Cursed be
Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.... Blessed be the Lord God of
Shem, and Canaan shall be his servant." ... Now, as we have no state of servitude in the context
or the usage of the times with which to compare this, and as only Canaan and his descendants
are included in the curse, we must look to their subsequent history for the fulfillment of
the prophecy, and the kind of servitude there implied.

We find the descendants of Canaan and their land defined in Gen. 10:15-20. They were not the
Africans, as some ignorantly assert, but the Canaanites, who dwelt in Canaan, and were there
destroyed by the Israelites, or rendered tributaries, except the Gibeonites, who were doomed
to be "hewers of wood and drawers of water," the serfs of the temple service. Josh. 9:23, 27.
There is not one word of buying and selling individuals--no chattelism, or any sanction of
it; there is a performing of the service of the temple, or paying tribute, but never slaves
or chattels. Canaan thus became the servant (not slave) of Shem; and when afterward Israel
was oppressed and rendered tributary to other nations, the Canaanites became thus not only
"servants," but "servants of servants."

                    3. Patriarchal Servitude.

The next example of the word "servant" brings us to that epoch in relation to which the Harmony
Presbytery of South Carolina says, "Slavery has existed from the days of those good old slaveholders
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, (who are now in the kingdom of heaven,) to the time when the apostle
Paul sent a runaway home to his master Philemon, and wrote a Christian and paternal letter
to this slaveholder, which we find still stands in the canon of the Scriptures."

The account we have of Abraham's servants is briefly as follows: That he had men-servants and
maid-servants, Gen. 12:16; 14:14; 17:27, (not slaves, for we have shown above by numerous passages
that to give such a definition to the term "servant" is false and absurd, unless sustained
by the context or the usage of the times;) that they numbered some two thousand persons, (reckoning
by the number of fighting men among them, generally one in five of the population,) were trained
and accustomed to arms, Gen. 14:14; could inherit property, Gen. 15:3, 4; in religious ordinances
were perfectly equal with the master, Gen. 17:10-14; had entire control not only over the property,
but also the heirs of the household, Gen. 24:2-10; lastly, they were invariably considered
as men, not slaves or chattels. Gen. 24:30, 32.

"But," it is objected, "some of these servants were 'bought with money;' therefore they must
have been possessed as 'chattel slaves.'" This conclusion depends partly on the meaning of
the Hebrew verb קָנָה, kaunau, "to buy;" and asserts that whenever this term is applied to
persons, it implies the relation of chattel slavery. The primary definition of the verb, given
by Gesenius, is, to erect; then, 1. To found or create; 2. To get, gain, obtain, acquire, possess;
3. To get by purchase, to buy.

Let us see the meaning of this term, applied to persons in other passages. In Gen. 31:15, Rachel
and Leah say of their father, "He hath sold us, and quite devoured also our money," referring
to Jacob's long service for them; were they chattels? Gen. 47:23, Joseph bought the Egyptians;
were they chattels? Ex. Ruth 4:10, "Ruth the Moabitess have I purchased this day to be my wife;"
was she a chattel? These passages clearly show that the simple application of the term "bought
with money" does not imply property and possession as a chattel.

Take the case of Bilhah and Zilpah, given by Laban (Gen. 29:24, 29,) as handmaids (אָמָה) to
his daughters Leah and Rachel. Gen. 30:4-14. They become Jacob's concubines, and bear him four
sons--Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. Here the case is plain; the mothers are "servants," they
have children, and these, instead of being (as in similar cases daily at the South) "reputed
and adjudged in law to be chattels personal," are recognized as free and equal with the other
sons, Reuben, Judah, &c., and become, like them, heads of tribes in Israel. In these cases,--and
they are all which relate to the point at issue,--either the status of these servants did or
did not decide that of their children. If it did, then, by the laws of chattelism, the children
being free prove the mother (though servant) to be free; if it did not, then the mother was
held only by feudal allegiance, while the children were always free. In either case the conditions
of chattelism did not exist; they were not slaves, but free persons in the same condition as
members of wandering Arab and Tartar tribes to this day.

Did the second fundamental condition of chattelism mentioned above exist? The slave, being
property, can not possess or inherit property. In Gen. 15:3 we find Abraham complaining to
the Lord, "Behold, to me thou hast given no seed, and lo, one born in my house is my heir!"
The same term is used here as in speaking of Abraham's other servants; and yet this "servant"
is declared by Abraham his acknowledged heir. Here there is a manifest contradiction of the
conditions of a chattel slave. They can not inherit property; this man could; therefore he
was not a slave. It is an entirely gratuitous assumption to assert that Abraham's dependents
were slaves; for similar cases occur daily in nomadic tribes, as formerly they did in Scottish
clans. If the chief has no child capable of succeeding him in office, he chooses from his dependents
some tried and trusty warrior, and adopts him as lieutenant or henchman, to succeed him as
heir or chief. Just so Abraham, then nearly eighty years old, despairing of a son to take his
place as chief of the tribe, adopted some young warrior (perhaps a leader in the battle of
Hobah) as his heir, with the proviso of resigning in favor of a son if any be born. But in
the case of Jacob's four sons the conclusion is self-evident--children of "servants" or "handmaids,"
yet recognized as free like the other sons, sharing the property of the father equally with
them;--the conditions of a state of chattelism did not exist.

These things prove conclusively that the term "servant" never meant slave in patriarchal families;
that the term "bought with money" referred only to feudal allegiance or service for a time
agreed on by both parties. These servants could possess and inherit property; their children
were free; they were trained to the use of arms; in religious matters master and servant were
alike and equal; and they were always considered and called men, never slaves or chattels,--all
which are directly contrary to the principles and express enactments of American slave law,
and are the characteristics of free persons even at the South. Add to this the significant
fact that not one word is said in the patriarchal records of selling any of these servants,
(the only act mentioned of selling a human being is that of Joseph by his brethren, so bitterly
reprobated and repented of by them soon after,) though frequently bought; that no fugitive
law existed, in fact could not exist in a wandering tribe,--and the natural conclusion is,
that they were not slaves, but free men and women; and therefore the records of patriarchal
society conclusively deny the existence of chattel slaves or slavery as one of its institutions.

Years pass, and we find the Israelites reduced to a servile condition as the serfs of the Egyptians.
God, in his purposes, allowed them to remain thus for a time, and then, instead of sanctioning
even this modified form of slavery, demanded their instant release; and on refusal, with terrible
judgments on their oppressors, he led forth that army of fugitive slaves, and drowned their
pursuers in the Red Sea.

                        4. Mosaic Laws.

We come next to the sanction and authority of chattel slavery claimed to exist in the laws
and economy of these people just escaped from bondage, and framed by him who had shown his
displeasure against slavery by nearly destroying a nation of slaveholders for holding and catching
slaves. "truly what keeps you acquire?"

 Ex. 22:3. "He should make
full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft;" in case of debt,
Matt. 18:34, "till he should pay all that was due to him."

2. Servants obtained from the heathen. These were, first, captives. From the account of the
first taking of captives by the Israelites, Num. 31:7-47, we learn, verse 7, that they marched
into Midian, slew all the males, and seized the women, children, flocks, and herds. On their
return Moses reprimanded them for disobeying God's command by preserving the grown women; and
thereupon they killed all but the virgins and children, reserving them for adoption into the
families of the nation. In Deut. 20:14 and 21:10-14, we have these commands and regulations
given, with an express prohibition of the enslavement of these captives, in case of repudiation
by the captors. Now, all slaveholding tribes and nations, when they seize captives for slaves,
aim to obtain as many strong and vigorous men as possible; must it not, therefore, fairly be
inferred from this regulation that God, by prohibiting instead of sanctioning the most productive
mode of slave-making,--the enslavement of prisoners of war,--did not intend, but positively
prohibited, the Israelites from becoming a slaveholding nation?

Secondly, "bought with money." The law referring to these is Lev. As we have already stated,
the Hebrews had but two terms for "servant"--the generic term evedh, one under contract for
a term of years, and saukir, one hired by the day, week, or year. Now, the term here translated
"bondman" is the generic עֶבֶד, evedh, elsewhere translated "servant," and therefore should
have been thus translated here, unless a different rendering is required by the context. The
more literal reading of the Hebrew is, "And thy men-servants and thy maid-servants which shall
be to thee from the nations around you, of them shall ye procure the man-servant and maid-servant."
What, then, was the difference between the Hebrew and heathen evedh?

This. The Hebrew could only be an evedh, a servant by contract, for six years, Ex. 21:2--"Six
years shall he serve, but in the seventh he shall go out free;" (longer service could not be
contracted for, but must be voluntary, Ex. 21:5;) or as a hired servant or sojourner till the
jubilee, but never beyond. Lev. 25:10, 39-41. But a heathen could bind himself as an evedh
for longer than six years; and thus his service, unlike the Hebrew, could be "bought" as "an
inheritance for your children after you," but, like the Hebrew voluntary "for ever" servants,
they were bondmen for the longest time known by the law--till death or the jubilee.

Is it objected that the terms "buy," "possession," "for ever," are used, and indicate chattelism?
We answer, All admit the Hebrew was not a chattel; for his service expired at the seventh year,
the death of himself or his master. "He shall serve him for ever;" but, if both lived on, this
service, though voluntary, as has been shown, expired with all such claims at the jubilee.
Since the same terms, and, as we shall show directly, the jubilee, applied equally to both,
if it does not prove the one a chattel, it does not the other; therefore both are equally voluntary
contractors. The service, and not the bodies, were bought; and both were equally free at the
jubilee.

Two objects were accomplished by this law. 1st. To permit the Hebrews to obtain that assistance
in tilling the land, which otherwise they would not have been allowed to do. 2d. To increase
the numbers of the commonwealth, since the Hebrews, in obedience to the Abrahamic covenant,
Gen. 17:10-14; Ex. 12:44-49, were bound to circumcise these indented servants "bought with
money," thus making them part of the household during their period of service, and also naturalized
citizens of the state, members of the congregation, partakers of all the rites and privileges
common to the mass of the people. Ex. 12:44-9. Num. 15:15-30, "One ordinance shall be both
for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
for ever in your generations; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord." Lev. In
accordance with the frequently-repeated injunction of this law of equality, they were invariably
recognized as citizens, and alike with Hebrew servants, were amenable to, and received protection
from, the laws of the state.

In further proof of this, and in direct opposition to chattelism, is the fact, that the laws
regulating the relation of master and servant are each and all enacted for the benefit and
protection of the servant, and not one for that of the master. Again, when property is spoken
of, oxen, sheep, &c., the term owner is always used, master never; when servants and masters
are spoken of, master is always used, owner never. Ex. 21:29, "The ox shall be stoned, and
his owner also shall be put to death," Ex. But, Deut. 25:15, "Thou shall not deliver to his
master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee."

The inference from all this is plain. No such thing as property in man is recognized in the
Mosaic law; but God, finding polygamy and the law of serfdom existing among the Israelites,
did not see fit to abolish them at once, but so hampered and hedged them about by restrictive
statutes as gradually and finally to abolish them altogether.

                    5. Restrictive Laws.

But lest oppression should trample upon the rights of the laboring classes, and aim at their
enslavement,--which actually happened afterward, and was one of the principal items of God's
indictment (Jer. 22:3; 34:8-22) against the Jews prior to their destruction by Nebuchadnezzar,--three
special enactments were made to prevent such iniquity, and break up any attempt at chattel
slavery in the nation.

First. The law against kidnaping.--Ex. Thus the one great means of obtaining slaves is forbidden.
He who (no matter where) seizes a human being, (no matter whom,) and reduces him to involuntary
servitude, shall die; for he seeks to take away the rights and privileges of freedom, all that
goes to make up life; seeks to make property of man, to extinguish the man in the chattel.

"But," it is said, "this only refers to stealing slaves." Mark the logic: a man could seize
and enslave another with impunity; but if, afterward, the father, brother, or friend of the
enslaved should attempt to rescue him, he must die! Glorious argument for slaveholders and
slave-catchers! It is also said this refers to Hebrews, not strangers. Let God answer. This
is his interpretation of the breadth of the law given in the preceding verse, "He that killeth
a man, he shall be put to death." The law, therefore, is unrestricted and universal; Hebrew
or heathen, he that killeth a man and he that stealeth a man shall alike die; thus putting
slavery and murder on the same footing, as equally criminal. Now, if God sanctioned slavery,
why did he make such an inconsistent law as this forbidding it?

Second. The law concerning fugitives.--Deut.

There is no equivocation here; "thou shalt not deliver unto his master." It is imperative;
they were to receive him among them as a citizen, and, if need be, protect him from his master;
mark, not a "heathen" or "Hebrew," servant, but the "servant," heathen or Hebrew, whoever should
fly from the ill treatment or injustice of a hard master. Compare for a moment the Hebrew and
American fugitive laws. The Hebrew says, "Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant
that is escaped." The American says, "Thou shalt deliver him up to his master, or be fined
one thousand dollars, and suffer six months' imprisonment." The Hebrew says, "He shall dwell
with thee ... thou shalt not oppress him." The American law says, "The commissioner who tries
the case shall get five dollars if he fails, and ten if he succeeds in 'delivering to his master'
the fugitive, on the simple affidavit of the former that he is his slave."

What are the deductions from this law of Moses? The return of stray property is expressly commanded
in Deut. 22:1-3; the return of servants is expressly forbidden here; the servant could leave
a hard master at any time, and the state could not compel him to return: it did not recognize
the condition of forced, but only voluntary servitude, and thus rendered the existence of chattelism
impossible.

The third great protective law was that of the Jubilee.--Lev. ... Here the expression is emphatic,
no reservations are made, no restrictions allowed. As the sound of יוֹבֵל, יוֹבֵל, Yovāl, Yovāl,
sounded through the land, and was echoed back from hill and village, from hamlet and town,
the cry was taken up, and borne along by the laboring thousands of Israel, many of whom had
been toiling under contract for years, by the unfortunate debtor, and those whom poverty had
compelled to part with "the old house at home," all returned, all were free. "Liberty, liberty!"

It is vain to assume that the benefits of the Jubilee were restricted to a particular class.
To what class? Not the six years' servants; they were freed in the seventh. Not to debtors;
there was no law compelling them to serve at all; therefore they could only serve voluntarily
to pay their debts. Not to thieves; they could only be compelled to make restitution of the
thing stolen, or its value; that paid, they were free. The only other classes to whom the law
could apply were "all the inhabitants of the land" who served the longest time, the Hebrew
"for ever" servants, and the heathen servants, thus preventing the possibility of the rise
and growth of a servile class, the curse of any country. In this way only can we account for
the fact that Jewish history never mentions the existence of a large servile class, or a servile
insurrection in Israel, so common and disastrous an occurrence in the history of ancient slaveholding
communities.

Some object here, that the term "inhabitants" implies "all the Hebrews," and excludes the strangers,
Canaanites, &c.; but by admitting that "all the Hebrews" were freed at the Jubilee, they admit
that those who, in Ex. 21:6, are servants "for ever," are also freed, and thus to serve "for
ever" only implies till the Jubilee. If, then, "for ever" means only till the Jubilee in one
case, it means no more in the other. And if we show that the strangers and Canaanites were
considered "inhabitants of the land," then the Jubilee referred to Hebrew and stranger alike,
and both were free. In Ex. 18:25; Num. 33:52-55, Moses calls the heathen "the inhabitants of
the land;" and as he was likely to understand the meaning of the term pretty well, he either
refers in the Jubilee law to Hebrews, Canaanites, and all, or he meant Canaanites and heathen
alone, which is still more decisive. Again, in 2 Sam. 11:2-27; 23:39, we find one of these

How did he fulfill this commission and pledge? No code of laws and dogmas, terse and dry, were
issued by him for the government of his kingdom; but the great principle was proclaimed of
a common brotherhood as children of God our Father, and of love to him as such. In his sermon
on the mount, the parables of the lost sheep and silver piece, the good Samaritan, the prodigal
son, the Pharisee and the publican; in his private teachings to his disciples; and, above all,
by his daily example he taught and illustrated, as the leading characteristics of his kingdom,
love to God, the brotherhood of man, the rights of all, however poor, degraded, or despised.
More, he makes this idea of brotherhood and equality even with himself, the great test in the
judgment. Matt. 25:40, 45: "And the king shall answer, and say unto them, Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
me." What will those who now boast of their large churches, composed almost entirely of slaves,
Christian ministers, and church members, bought, sold, lashed, and treated like cattle, answer
the King in that great day?

But to return: the result of such teachings was soon evident. "The common people heard him
gladly," hung on his steps and words by thousands, and hailed him as deliverer; while Scribes
and Pharisees, priests and rulers, denounced him as "a friend of publicans and sinners," only
seeking popularity among the masses, to disturb the public peace, and revolutionize the government.
Mark, it was not simply religious, but political interference and teaching they charged him
with, and on this charge they finally compassed his death.

In his private teachings to his disciples he strongly inculcated this truth. Striving among
themselves for the supremacy, he charges them, Matt. The law thus explicitly laid down, and
in John 13 enforced by his example, is the very opposite of chattelism. In his church, none
were to claim supremacy over others, much less enslave them; none to despise labor and the
laborer, much less condemn others to it while themselves lived in idleness.

Thus Christ, so far from sanctioning chattelism or property in man in any shape or form, by
precept and example taught the opposite, the dignity of labor and the laborer, the common brotherhood
of man, and consequent equality, political and religious. Did his apostles indorse this doctrine,
or, fearing the result, did they side with the all prevalent system of class legislation and
slavery?

                    Teachings of the Apostles. They not only believed in "liberty, equality, and
fraternity," but practised its extreme--not only equality of rights, but
equality of property, among the brotherhood.

But this was comparatively easy in Judea, where the principle of equality was already partly
recognized, and the existence of chattelism prevented by the action of the Mosaic code. John
13:34-5. Gal.

Can language be more express and conclusive than this? The distinctions here dissolved by the
waters of baptism, and blended into "one in Christ Jesus," are not, as our southern brethren
assert, simply religious, but NATIONAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL--slavery, and the spirit of caste
and clan which upholds it, alike forbidden, and liberty, equality, and fraternity, social,
political, and religious, proclaimed as the rule of Christ's kingdom.

Principles like these came upon the world like the morning sunlight, scattering the mists of
superstitious ignorance, melting the icy pride and selfishness of the mighty, permeating all
classes and relations of society with their secret influence, and blending all into one harmonious
brotherhood of love and peace. Apparently they were subject as others to the laws of the state,
but in secret were bound by stronger ties, and governed by higher, nobler laws, than the world
outside dreamed of.

Instead of the Roman law of marriage, regarding the wife as the husband's slave, he must love
her as himself; more, as Christ loved the church. Instead of the tyranny on one side, and the
retaliating disobedience on the other, of the Roman parental relation, it became the image
of our heavenly Father's love, and our trusting obedience to him. The relation of slave, "pro
nullo, pro quadrupedo, pro mortuo," (as a nobody, a quadruped, a dead man,) to his master,
became the relation of brethren, the one to render true and faithful service, Eph. 6:5, the
other never to threaten, Eph. 6:9, much less punish; not to regard them as chattels, as under
the Roman law, but to give them just and equal compensation for their service, Eph. 6:9; Col.
4:1, "knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven," "neither is there respect of persons with
him." The legal deed of manumission was unnecessary; for as, when master and slave land in
England, they may remain connected as master and free servant, never as master and slave, so,
on admission into the brotherhood of the church, the waters of baptism, as shown above, dissolved
the relation of slavery, and substituted that of freemen and brethren.

Again, believers were members of Christ's body. He dwelt in them; and therefore every indignity
and injury done to them was done to him in their person. To enslave, buy, and sell them was
to enslave, buy, and sell Christ himself. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these
my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Who, then, would dare hold a brother Christian as a
slave? What! make merchandise of the person of Christ? Never! the cry of Judas would ring around
them as they were driven ignominiously from the church.

"Why," it is objected, "did not the apostles preach immediate emancipation, instead of indorsing
slavery by defining its duties--'Servants, obey your masters,' &c.? and Paul even sent back
a slave." 1. The primary object of the apostles was not simply "to preach liberty to the captives;"
this was but a branch of the tree planted "for the healing of the nations." Their object was
to sow the principles of faith, love, justice, and equality, well knowing that, when these
took root and flourished, among the first fruit would be "liberty to all the inhabitants of
the land." 2. Had this been their great object, they took the best and speediest plan for its
accomplishment. Attacking the system directly, the appearance of the Christian missionary would
have been the signal for servile war and untold bloodshed, the slave against the master, the
poor against the rich; and the heathen rulers, eager for a pretext to crush them, would have
denounced them as lighting the torch of rebellion and war; and the further spread of the gospel
would have been drowned in the blood of its founders. But they took the very course which God
adopted among the Israelites in regard to servitude, not directly prohibiting it, but inculcating
principles of social equality and progress, restricting the master's power, and protecting
the servant's rights, till, master and slave blended in one, the name of slave was lost in
that of Christian. 3. The relation and duties of master and servant are defined by the apostles
exactly as they might be to-day in England or the free states--as those of men, never as owner
and property; on the contrary, all ownership of man by other than God is expressly denied.
There the ownership is clearly asserted; how can man claim it? "Render to Cesar the things
that are Cesar's, and to God the things that are God's," lest you be found robbing God himself.
Again, 1 Cor. 7:21, 23, "Art thou called, being a servant? care not for it; but, if thou mayst
be made free, (δύασαι γενέσθαι, canst become free,) use it rather." What can be more explicit
than this? First, ownership of man is denied even to himself, much more to another. 3318 LANE (JOHN)

Converted at Rome, Paul heard his story, and in his letter, instead of thinking he is doing
Philemon a favor, has to earnestly "beseech," almost command, his reception as a favor to himself.
Not one word of property or right in him, save the right of love as one of the brotherhood.
"NOT NOW AS A SERVANT, but above a servant, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much
more to thee!" Onesimus had left the "slave" in his heathenism; in Christ he became the "brother"
of Philemon and Paul. Instead of sanctioning chattelism, it positively denies it by affirming
voluntary service, the equality of men as brethren, to be loved as Christ himself.

Thus Christ and his apostles, so far from upholding chattelism in their teachings, denounced
the ownership of man by any but God, and inculcated its opposite--love, liberty, equality,
and fraternity--by precept and example. And subsequent history showed the result.

Christ said of the teachings of the Pharisees, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Apply
this test to the teachings of the apostles and the primitive churches in regard to slavery.
When they went forth, "darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people;" slavery
sat enthroned in might over Europe; and the cries of the oppressed millions had only had a
hearing on the battle or before the throne of God.

When the Reformation came slavery had disappeared in Europe; and the voice of the people was
heard asserting their rights, feebly, indeed, at first, but ever since growing stronger and
stronger "as the voice of many waters." What has caused this change?

          Before the New York Court of Appeals, on the "Lemmon
                            Slave Case."

"I submit most respectfully that the only desire I have manifested here or elsewhere, in reference
to the question, has been to draw the mind of the court and the intelligent mind of the American
people, to the true question which underlies the whole conflict, and that is the question to
which my friend (W. W. Evarts, Esq.) has addressed the best, and, in my judgment, the finest
part of his very able argument. * * * My friend denounces the institution of slavery as a monstrous
injustice, as a sin, as a violation of the law of God and of the law of man, of natural law
or natural justice; and in his argument in another place, he called your attention to the enormity
of the result claimed in this case, that these eight persons--and not only they, but their
posterity to the remotest time--were, by your Honors' judgment, to be consigned to this shocking
condition of abject bondage and slavery. Do the embelisher, (imperfect, producing this Person upon
harde, which is induced also in the EDITIONS of his works, and aleborne leaves,) sold for 11s.
The. Him is one of the earliest output of interest press, and dibs have had the Maister from being

 But the reason why I call your Honors' attention
to its magnitude is this: that you may contemplate it in the connection in which my learned
friend has presented it; that it is a SIN--a violation of natural justice and the law of God;
that it is a monstrous scheme of iniquity for defrauding the laborer of his wages--one of those
sins that crieth aloud to heaven for vengeance; that it is a course of unbridled rapine, fraud,
and plunder, by which three millions and their posterity are to be oppressed throughout all
time. Now, is it a sin? Is this an outrage against divine law and natural justice? If it be
such an outrage, then I say it is a sin of the greatest magnitude, of the most enormous and
flagitious character that was ever presented to the human mind. The man who does not shrink
from it with horror is utterly unworthy the name of a man. It is no trivial offence, that may
be tolerated with limitations and qualifications; that we can excuse ourselves for supporting
because we have made some kind of a bargain to support it. The tongue of no human being is
capable of depicting its enormity; it is not in the power of the human heart to form a just
conception of its wickedness and cruelty. And what, I ask, is the rational and necessary consequence,
if we regard it to be thus sinful, thus unjust, thus outrageous?"

Dr. Hopkins, of Newport, being much engaged in urging the sinfulness of slavery, called one
day at the house of Dr. Bellamy in Bethlem, Connecticut, and while there pressed upon him the
duty of liberating his only slave. Many of them contain important gospel by him came, particularly
done at own publications; and the Catalogue, therefore, in all which Mr. Thorpe issues, contains
numerous notes are highly whole to bibliographical and literary captives.
 Dr. B. replied that the slave was faithful, judicious, trusted with
every thing, and would not accept freedom if offered. "Will you free him if he desires it?"
repeated Dr. H. "Yes," answered Dr. Bellamy, "I will." "Call him then." The man appeared. "Have
you a good, kind master?" asked Dr. Hopkins. "Oh! yes, very, very good." "And are you happy?"
"Yes, master, very happy." "Would you be more happy if you were free?" His face brightened.
"Oh! yes, master, a great deal more happy." "From this moment," said Dr. Bellamy, "you are free."
