A fact perceived for the first time must needs be attended to, in order that it may be perceived.
That is, the first and original perception of a fact is a highly conscious response. But the
perception of a fact, like any other form of response, becomes easy with practice; the linkage
of stimulus and response becomes stronger and stronger, till finally the stimulus arouses the
perceptive response almost automatically. The familiar fact is perceived without receiving
close attention, or even without receiving any attention. While your attention is absorbed
in reading or thinking, you may respond to the sight of the flower in a vase on your table
by knowing it to be there, you may respond to the noise of the passing street car by knowing
what that is, and you may respond to the contact of your foot with the leg of the chair by
dimly knowing what that object is. A great deal of this inattentive perception of familiar
facts is always going on. Aside from sensation and from some of the reflexes, the perception
of familiar facts is the most practised and the easiest of all responses.

The laws and sub-laws of learning apply perfectly to practised perception. The more frequently,
the more recently, and the more intensely a given fact has been perceived, the more readily
is it perceived again. The more a given fact is in line with the mental set of the moment,
the more readily is it perceived. Sometimes it is so readily perceived that we think we see
it when it isn't there. If you are hunting for a lost knife, anything remotely resembling {434}
a knife will catch your eye and for an instant be perceived as the missing object.

The principle of substitute stimulus applies remarkably well to practised perception. The first
time you perceive an object, you observe it attentively, and expose your perceptive apparatus
to the whole collection of stimuli that the object sends your way. The next time you need not
observe it so attentively, for you make the same perceptive response to a part of the original
collection of stimuli. The response originally aroused by the whole collection of stimuli is
later aroused by a fraction of this collection. The stimulus may be reduced considerably, and
still arouse the perception of the same fact. A child is making the acquaintance of the dog.
The dog barks, and the child watches the performance. He not only sees the dog, and hears the
noise, but he sees the dog bark, and hears the dog bark. This original perception is a unitary
response to the combination of sight and sound. Thereafter he does not require both stimuli
at once, but, when he hears this noise, he perceives the dog barking, and when he sees the
dog he sees an object that can bark. In the same way, a thousand objects which furnish stimuli
to more than one of the senses are perceived as units, and, later, need only act on a single
sense to be known.

The stimulus, instead of being reduced, may be modified, and still arouse the same perception
as before. A face appears in the baby's field of view, but away across the room so that it
is a very small object, visually. The face approaches and gradually becomes a larger visual
object, and the light and shadow upon it change from moment to moment, but it remains nearly
enough the same to arouse essentially the same perception in the child. He comes to know the
face at various distances and angles and under various lights.

{435}

Again, the child holds a block in his hands, and looks at it square on, so that it is really
a rectangle in his field of view. He turns it slightly, and now it is no longer visually a
rectangle, but an oblique parallelogram. But the change is not enough to abolish the first
perception; he sees it as the same object as before. By dint of many such experiences, we see
a book cover or a door as a rectangle, no matter at what angle we may view it, and we know
a circle for a circle even though at most angles it is really an ellipse in the field of view.
A large share of practised perceptions belong under the head of "response by analogy",[Footnote:
See p. 406.] since they consist in making the same response to the present stimulus that has
previously been made to a similar but not identical stimulus. If every modified stimulus gave
a new and different perception, it would be a slow job getting acquainted with the world. A
thing is never twice the same, as a collection of stimuli, and yet, within wide limits, it
is always perceived as the same thing.

Corrected Perception

Response by analogy, however, often leads us astray, in making us perceive a new object as
essentially the same as something already familiar. First impressions of a new object or acquaintance
often need revision, because they do not work well. They do not work well because they are
rough and ready, taking the object in the lump, with scant attention to details which may prove
to be important. It is easy to follow the law of combination and respond to a whole collection
of stimuli, but to break up the collection and isolate out of it a smaller collection to respond
to--that is something we will not do unless forced to it. Isolation and discrimination are
uphill work. When they occur, it is {436} because the rough and ready response has proved unsatisfactory,

Substitute response is the big factor in corrected perception, as substitute stimulus is in
practised perception. When our first perception of an object gets us into difficulties, then
we are forced to attend more closely and find something in the object that can serve as the
stimulus to a better response. This is the process by which we isolate, analyze, discriminate.

Our old friend, the white rat, learned to enter a door only if it bore a yellow sign. [Footnote:
See p. 304.] It was uphill work for him, hundreds of trials being required before the discriminating
response was established; but he learned it finally. At the outset, a door was a door to the
rat, and responded to as such, without regard to the sign. Whenever he entered a door without
the sign, he got a shock, and scurried back; and before venturing again he looked all around,
seeking, we may say, a stimulus to guide him; incidentally, he looked at the yellow disk, and
this stimulus, though inconspicuous and feeble to a rat, finally got linked up with the entering
response. The response of first finding and then following the sign had been substituted for
the original response of simply entering.

In the same way the newly hatched chick, which at first pecks at all small objects, caterpillars
included, learns to discriminate against caterpillars. In a practical sense, the chick, like
the rat, learns to distinguish between stimuli that at first aroused the same response. It
is in the same way that the human being is driven to discriminate and attend to details. He
is brought to a halt by the poor results of his first rough and ready perception, scans the
situation, isolates some detail and, finding response to this detail to bring satisfactory
results, substitutes response to this {437} detail for his first undiscriminating response
to the whole object.

The child at first treats gloves as alike, whether rights or lefts, but thus gets into trouble,
and is driven to look at them more sharply till he perceives the special characteristics of
rights and lefts. He could not describe the difference, to be sure, but he sees it well enough
for his purposes. If you ask an older person to describe this difference, and rally him on
his inability to do so, he is thus driven to lay them side by side and study out the difference
still more precisely.

The average non-mechanical person, on acquiring an automobile, takes it as a gift of the gods,
a big total thing, simply to sit in and go. He soon learns certain parts that he must deal
with, but most of the works remain a mystery to him. Then something goes wrong, and he gets
out to look. "What do you suppose this thing is here? I never noticed it before". Tire trouble
teaches him about wheels, engine trouble leads him to know the engine, ignition trouble may
lead him to notice certain wires and binding-posts that were too inconspicuous at first to
attract his attention. A car becomes to him a thing with a hundred well-known parts, instead
of just one big totality.

Blocked response, closer examination, new stimulus isolated that gives satisfactory response--such
is, typically, the process of analytic perception.

Sensory Data Serving as Signs of Various Sorts of Fact

Among facts perceived, we may list things and events, and their qualities and relations. Under
"things" we here include persons and animals and everything that would ordinarily be called
an "object". Under "events", we include movement, change and happenings of all sorts. Under
{438} "qualities" we may include everything that can be discovered in a thing or event taken
by itself, and under "relations" anything that can be discovered by comparing or contrasting
two things or events. The "groups" that we have several times spoken of as being observed would
here be included under "things"; but the strict logic of the whole classification is not a
matter of importance, as the only object in view is to call attention to the great variety
of facts that are perceived.

Now the question arises, by what signs or indications these various facts are perceived. Often,
as we have seen, the fact is by no means fully presented to the senses, and often it is far
from easy for the perceiver to tell on what signs the perception depends. He knows the fact,
but how he knows it he cannot tell. A large part of the very extensive experimental investigation
of perception has been concerned with this problem of ferreting out the signs on which the
various perceptions are based, the precise stimuli to which the perceptions respond.

For example, we can examine objects by feeling of them with a stick held in the hand, and thus
perceive their roughness or smoothness; but how do we sense these facts? It seems to us as
if we felt them with the end of the stick, but that is absurd, since there are no sense organs
in the stick. It must be that we perceive the roughness by means of sensations arising in the
hand and arm, but to identify these sensations is a much harder task than to discover the objective
fact of roughness.

Again, we distinguish the tones of two musical instruments by aid of their overtones, but elaborate
experiments were required to prove this, since ordinarily we do not distinguish the overtones,
and could simply say that the instruments sounded differently, and let it go at that.

Once more, consider our ability to perceive time intervals; {439} and to distinguish an interval
of a second from one of a second and a quarter. How in the world can any one perceive time?
Time is no force that could conceivably act as a stimulus to a sense organ. It must be some
change or process that is the stimulus and that serves as the indication of duration. Most
likely, it is some muscular or internal bodily change, but none of the more precise suggestions
that have been offered square with all the facts. It cannot be the movements of breathing that
give us our perception of time, for we can hold our breath and still distinguish one short
interval from another. It cannot be the heart beat, for we can beat time in a rhythm that cuts
across the rate of the heart beat. When a singer is accompanying himself on the piano, keeping
good time in spite of the fact that the notes are uneven in length, and meanwhile using his
feet on the pedals, what has he got left to beat time with? No one has located the stimulus
to which accurate time perception responds, though, in a general way, we are pretty sure that
change of one sort or another is the datum. With longer intervals, from a minute to several
hours, the sign of duration is probably the amount happening in the interval, or else such
progressive bodily changes as hunger and fatigue.

The Perception of Space

Stimuli for the perception of location are provided by all the senses. We perceive a taste
as in the mouth, thirst as in the throat, hunger pangs as in the stomach. To a familiar odor
we may respond by knowing the odorous substance to be close at hand. To stimulation of the
semi-circular canals we respond by knowing the direction in which we are being turned.

We respond to sounds by knowing the direction from which they come, and the distance from which
they come; {440} but it must be confessed that we are liable to gross errors here. To perceive
the distance of the sounding body we have to be familiar with the sound at various distances,
and our perception of distance is based on this knowledge. As to the direction of sound, experiment
has proved that we do little more than distinguish between right and left; we are all at sea
in attempting to distinguish front from back or up from down. Apparently the only datum we
have to go by is the different stimulation given the two ears according as the sound comes
from the right or left.

The remaining senses, the cutaneous, the kinesthetic and the visual, afford much fuller data
for the perception of spatial facts. Movements of the limbs are perceived quite accurately
as to direction and extent.

A cutaneous stimulus is located with fair exactness, though much less exactly on such regions
as the back than on the hands or lips. If you were asked how you distinguished one point from
another on the back of the hand, you could only answer that they felt different; and if you
were further asked whether a pencil point applied to the two points of the skin did not feel
the same, you would have to acknowledge that it did feel the same, except that it was felt
in a different place. In other words, you would not be able to identify the exact data on which
your perception of cutaneous position is based. Science has done no better, but has simply
given the name of "local sign" to the unanalyzed sensory datum that gives a knowledge of the
point stimulated.

In handling an object, as also in walking and many other movements, the cutaneous and kinesthetic
senses are stimulated together, and between them furnish data for the perception of many spatial
facts, such as the shape of an object examined by the hand. The spherical shape is certainly
better perceived by this combination of tactile and kinesthetic {441} sensations than by vision,
and the same is probably true of many similar spatial facts. That is, when we see a round ball,
the visual stimulus is a substitute for the tactile and cutaneous stimuli that originally had
most to do with arousing this perception.

In part by this route of the substitute stimulus, the sense of vision comes to arouse almost
all sorts of spatial perceptions. Of itself, the retina has "local sign" since we can tell
where in the field of view a seen object is, i.e., in what direction it is from us. This visual
perception of location is so much more exact than the cutaneous or kinesthetic that it cannot
possibly be derived from them; and the same is true of the visual perception of difference
in length, which is one of the most accurate forms of perception. The retina must of itself
afford very complete stimuli for the perception of location and size, as far as these are confined
to the two dimensions, up-down and right-left. But, when you stop to think, it seems impossible
that the retina should afford any data for perceiving distance in the front-back dimension.

The retina is a screen, and the stimulus that it gets from the world outside is like a picture
cast upon a screen. The picture has the right-left and up-down dimensions, but no front-back
dimension. How, then, does it come about, as it certainly does, that we perceive by aid of
the eye the distance of objects from us, and the solidity and relief of objects? This problem
in visual perception has received much attention and been carried to a satisfactory solution.

Consider, first, what stimuli indicative of distance and relief could affect a single motionless
eye. The picture on the retina could then be duplicated by a painter on canvas, and the signs
of distance available would be the same in the two cases. The painter uses foreshortening,
making a man in the picture small in proportion to his distance away; {442} and in the same
way, when any familiar object casts a small picture on the retina, we perceive the object,
not as diminished in size, but as far away. The painter colors his near hills green, his distant
ones blue, and washes out all detail in the latter--"aërial perspective", he calls this. His
distant hill peeks from behind his nearer one, being partially covered by it. His shadows fall
in a way to indicate the relief of the landscape. These signs of distance also affect the single
resting eye and are responded to by appropriate spatial perceptions.

Now let the single eye move, with the head, from side to side: an index of the distance of
objects is thus obtained, additional to all the painter has at his disposal, for the distant
objects in the field of view now seem to move with the eye, while the nearer objects slide
in the opposite direction. How much this sign is ordinarily made use of in perceiving distance
is not known; it is believed not to be used very much, and yet it is the most delicate of all
the signs of distance. The reason why it may not be much used by two-eyed people is that another
index almost as delicate and handier to use is afforded by binocular vision.

When both eyes are open, we have a sign of distance that the painter does not use, though it
is used in stereoscope slides. The right and left eyes get somewhat different views of the
same solid object, the right eye seeing a little further around the object to the right, and
the left eye to the left. The disparity between the two retinal images, due to the different
angles at which they view the object, is greatest when the object is close at hand, and diminishes
to practically zero when it is a few hundred feet away. This disparity between the two retinal
images is responded to by perception of the distance and relief of the object.

It will be recalled [Footnote: See pp. 253-254.] that when two utterly inconsistent {443} views
are presented to the two eyes, as a red field to one and a green field to the other, the visual
apparatus balks and refuses to see more than one at a time--the binocular rivalry phenomenon.
But when the disparate views are such as are presented to the two eyes by the same solid object,
the visual apparatus (following the law of combination) responds to the double stimulation
by getting a single view of an object in three dimensions.

Esthetic Perception

Beauty, humor, pathos and sublimity can be perceived by the senses, though we might debate
a long time over the question whether these characteristics are really objective, or merely
our own feelings aroused by the objects, and then projected into them. However that may be,
there is no doubt that the ability to make these responses is something that can be trained,
and that some people are blind and deaf to beauty and humor that other people clearly perceive.
Many a one fails to see the point of a joke, or is unable to find any humor in the situation,
which are clearly perceived by another. Many a one sees only a sign of rain in a great bank
of clouds, only a weary climb in the looming mountain.

  "A primrose by the river's brim
  A yellow primrose was to him.
  And it was nothing more."

It would not be quite fair to describe such a one as lacking in feeling; he probably has, on
sufficient stimulus, the same feelings as another man, and it would be more exact to say that
he is lacking in perception of certain qualities and relations. He probably tends, by nature
and training, to practical rather than esthetic perception. To see any {444} beauty in a new
style of music or painting, or to sense the humor in a new form of humorous writing, you need
to be initiated, to be trained in observing the precise qualities and relations that are depended
on for the esthetic effect. A complex situation presents almost an unlimited range of facts
that may be perceived; no one perceives them all, and which he shall perceive depends on his
nature and training, as well as on his attitude or mental set at the moment when the situation
is presented.

Psychology has not by any means been idle in this field of esthetics; it has developed experimental
methods for determining the preferences of individuals and of social groups. But it must be
confessed that the results offer little that can be succinctly summarized.

One curious result is that even the very simplest objects can produce an esthetic effect. You
would scarcely suppose, for example, that a mere rectangle could produce any esthetic effect,
or that it would make any difference what exact proportions the rectangle possessed; and yet
it is found that some rectangles are preferred to others, and that the popular choice falls
upon what the art theorists have long known as the "golden section", a rectangle with a width
about sixty-two per cent, of its length. Also, however much you may like symmetry, you would
scarcely suppose that it could make much difference where, on a horizontal line, a little cross
line should be erected; and yet nearly every one, on being tested, will agree that the middle
is the best point. These are merely a couple of sample results from the numerous studies in
this field.

Social Perception

By the senses we perceive the motives and intentions of other people, their sincerity, goodness,
intelligence, and {445} many other traits. We see them angry or bored, amused, full of energy.
To be sure, none of these human characteristics is directly and fully sensed, but that is the
case also with many characteristics of inanimate objects which, nevertheless, we perceive by
aid of the senses. We perceive anger or sincerity in much the same way that we perceive moisture
or smoothness by the eye. To experience the anger of another person is a complex experience,
but a single element from this experience may come to serve as the sign of the whole condition.
A good share of the child's undirected education consists in learning to perceive the intentions
and characteristics of other people by aid of little signs. He learns to read the signs of
the weather in the family circle, and he learns in some measure to be a judge of men.

I once saw an instructive little incident, in which an older boy suddenly grabbed the cap from
a little boy's head, and held it out to the driver of a passing automobile, as if giving it
to him. The man saw the joke, and drove on laughing, but the little boy took it seriously and
was quite worried for fear the man would carry off his cap. An older child would have "seen
into" the situation readily; he could not have been teased in that way. Many social situations
which are "all Greek" to a little child are understood readily by an older person.

It would be very valuable if psychology could succeed in analyzing out the signs by which such
a trait as intelligence or "will power" is perceived, so as to reduce such perception to a
science; but it is very doubtful if this can be done. Some persons who probably have themselves
a keen perception of such traits have put forward systems, based upon the shape of the face,
etc. They probably think they perceive human traits according to their systems, but the systems
fail in other hands, and are undoubtedly {446} fallacious. No good judge of character really
goes by the shape of the face; he goes by little behavior signs which he has not analyzed out,
and therefore cannot explain to another person.

You can tell very little regarding a person's intelligence from his photograph. This has now
been pretty well established. Photographs of persons of various degrees of intelligence are
placed before those who are reputed to be good judges, and their estimates compared with the
test ratings, and there is no correspondence. You might just as well look at the back of the
photograph as at the front.

Even with the person before you, you are likely to commit great errors. This sort of incident
has happened. A young woman is brought before the court for delinquency, and the psychologist
who has tested her testifies that she is of low intelligence. But the young woman is good-looking
and graceful in her speech and manners, and so impresses the judge that he dismisses as "absurd"
the notion of her being feeble-minded. He sets her free, on which she promptly gets into trouble
again. Apparently the only way to perceive intelligence is to see a person in action, preferably
under standard conditions, where his performance can be measured; that is to say, in an intelligence
test.

Errors of Perception

The grocer needs to be assured of the accuracy of his scales, and the chemist of the high accuracy
of his chemical balance; the surveyor needs to know about the errors that may creep into the
process of measuring the length of a line or angle. All of them, using instruments to assist
in accurate perception of facts, are concerned about the accuracy of their instruments. Now,
we all use the senses in perceiving facts, and "errors of sense" therefore concern us {447}
all. Some of the errors committed in sense perception can be laid at the door of the senses,
and some rather belong in the sphere of perception proper.

If you come out of a cold room into a warm room, the latter seems warmer than it is; and if
you come out of a dark room into a light room, the latter seems brighter than it is. These
errors, due to adaptation of the temperature sense and of the retina, are properly classed
as errors of sense.

If you are taking a child's temperature with a "minute thermometer", it is best to use your
watch to tell you when the minute is up, for the minute, when you are simply waiting for it
to pass, seems very long. But if you are "working against time", a minute seems short. The
professor is shocked when the closing bell rings, and thinks that certainly the hour cannot
be up; but some of the students have been consulting their watches for quite a long while,
being sure the hour must be nearly over. These are scarcely errors of sense, but they are errors
of perception.

Where we tend to err in one certain direction from the truth, as in the examples just cited,
psychology speaks of a "constant error", and evidently the knowledge of such constant errors
is of importance wherever the facts are of importance. In a court of law, a witness often has
to testify regarding the length of time occupied by some event, and a knowledge of the constant
errors in time perception would therefore be of considerable legal importance. They would need
to be worked out in considerable detail, since they differ according to the desires and attitude
of the witness at the time of the event.

Besides constant errors, there are accidental or variable errors, due to slight momentary causes.
Both constant and variable errors can be illustrated by a series of shots at a target. The
variable error is illustrated by the scatter of {448} the hits, and the constant error by the
excess of hits above the bull's-eye, or below, or to the right or left. The constant error
can be corrected, once you know what it is; if results show that you tend to shoot too high,
you can deliberately aim lower. But the variability of any performance cannot be eliminated
except by long practice, and not altogether even then.

Experimental psychology has taken great pains in measuring the accuracy of different sorts
of perception. How small a difference in length can be perceived by the eye, how small a difference
of weight by the hand--these are sample problems in this line.

For example, to measure the fineness with which weights can be perceived when "hefted" in the
hand, you take two objects that are alike in size and appearance but differing slightly in
weight, and endeavor to decide which is the heavier just by lifting them. You try repeatedly
and keep track of the number of errors, using this number as a measure of the accuracy of perception.
Now, if one weight were twice as heavy as the other (one, for example, weighing 100 grams {449}
and the other 200), you would never make an error except through carelessness; but if one were
100 and the other 120 grams, you would make an occasional error, and the number of errors would
increase as the difference was decreased; finally, comparing 100 and 101 grams, you would get
almost as many wrong as right, so that your perception of that small difference would be extremely
unreliable.

  ERRORS IN PERCEIVING SMALL DIFFERENCES
  OF WEIGHT (From Warner Brown)

  Difference 20  16  12   8   4   8   2   1 grams

  Errors      1   2   5  18  28  81  89  44 per hundred trials

  The weights were in the neighborhood of 100 grams; each weight was
  compared with the 100-gram weight, and each such pair was lifted and
  judged 1400 times. Notice that the per cent of errors gradually
  increases as the difference becomes smaller.

The smaller the difference between two stimuli, the more numerous the errors in perceiving
it, or, the less perceptible it is, and there is no sharp line between a difference that can
be perceived and one that is too small to be perceived. That is the first great result from
the study of the perception of small differences.

The second great result is called Weber's law, which can be stated as follows: In the same
sort of perception, equal relative (not absolute) differences are equally perceptible. For
example, from the preceding table we see that 28 per cent. of errors are made in comparing
weights of 100 and 104 grams; then, according to Weber's law, 28 per cent, of errors would
also be made in comparing 200 grams with 208, or 500 with 520, or 1000 with 1040 grams, or
any pair of weights that stood to each other in the ratio of 100 to 104. Weber's law is only
approximately true for the perception of weights, since actually fewer errors are committed
in comparing 500 and 520 than in comparing 100 and 104 grams; but the discrepancy is not extremely
great here, and in {450} some other kinds of perception, as especially in comparing the brightness
of lights or the length of seen lines, the law holds good over a wide range of stimuli and
only breaks down near the upper and lower extremes. We are familiar, in ordinary life, with
the general truth of Weber's law, since we know that an inch would make a much more perceptible
addition to the length of a man's nose than to his height, and we know that turning on a second
light when only one is already lit gives a much more noticeable increase in the light than
if we add one more light when twenty are already burning.

A third great result of this line of study is that different sorts of perception are very unequal
in their fineness and reliability. Perception of brightness is about the keenest, as under
favorable conditions a difference of one part in one hundred can here be perceived with very
few errors. Visual perception of length of line is good for about one part in fifty, perception
of lifted weight for about one part in ten, perception of loudness of sound for about one part
in three. But the perception of small differences in the pitch of musical tones is keener still,
only that, not following Weber's law in the least, it cannot be expressed in the same way.
A person with a good ear for pitch can distinguish with very few errors between two tones that
differ by only one vibration per second, and can perceive this same absolute difference equally
well, whether the total vibration rate is 200, 400, or 800 vibrations per second.

Illusions

An error of perception is often called an "illusion", though this term is commonly reserved
for errors that are large and curious. When one who is being awakened by a bell perceives it
as a tom-tom, that is an illusion. An {451} illusion consists in responding to a sensory stimulus
by perceiving something that is not really there. The stimulus is there, but not the fact which
it is taken to indicate. Illusion is false perception.

The study of illusions is of value, not only as showing how far a given kind of perception
can be trusted, but also as throwing light on the process of perception. When a process goes
wrong, it sometimes reveals its inner mechanism more clearly than when everything is running
smoothly. Errors of any kind are meat to the psychologist.

Illusions may be classified under several headings according to the factors that are operative
in causing the deception.

1. Illusions due to peculiarities of the sense organs.

Here the stimulus is distorted by the sense organ and so may easily be taken as the sign of
an unreal fact.

Separate the points of a pair of compasses by about three-quarters of an inch, and draw them
across the mouth, one point above it and the other below; you will get the illusion of the
points separating as they approach the middle of the mouth (where the sensory nerve supply
is greatest), and coming together again as they are drawn to the cheek at the other side.

Under this same general head belong also after-images and contrast colors, and also double
vision whenever for any reason the two eyes are not accurately converged upon an object. The
fact that a vertical line appears longer than an equal horizontal is supposed to depend upon
some peculiarity of the retina. Aside from the use of this class of illusions in the detailed
study of the different senses, the chief thing to learn from them is they so seldom are full-fledged
illusions, because they are ignored or allowed for, and not taken as the signs of facts. An
after-image would constitute a genuine illusion if it were taken for some real {452} thing
out there; but as a matter of fact, though after-images occur very frequently--slight ones
practically every time the eyes are turned--they are ignored to such an extent that the student
of psychology, when he reads about them, often thinks them to be something unusual and lying
outside of his own experience. The same is true of double images. This all goes to show how
strong is the tendency to disregard mere sensation in the interest of getting objective facts.

2. Illusions due to preoccupation or mental set.

When an insane person hears the creaking of a rocking-chair as the voice of some one calling
him bad names, it is because he is preoccupied with suspicion. We might almost call this an
hallucination,[Footnote: See p. 375.] since he is projecting his own auditory images and taking
them for real sensations; it is, at any rate, an extreme instance of illusion. In a milder
form, similar illusions are often momentarily present in a perfectly normal person, as when
he is searching for a lost object and thinks he sees it whenever anything remotely similar
to the desired object meets his eyes; or as when the mother, with the baby upstairs very much
on her mind, imagines she hears him crying when the cat yowls or the next-door neighbors start
their phonograph. The ghost-seeing and burglar-hearing illusions belong here as well. The mental
set facilitates responses that are congruous with itself.

3. Illusions of the response-by-analogy type.

This is probably the commonest source of everyday illusions, and the same principle, as we
have seen, is operative in a host of correct perceptions. Perceiving the obliquely presented
rectangle as a rectangle is an example of correct perception of this type. Perceiving the buzzing
of a fly as an aeroplane is the same sort of response only that it happens to be incorrect.
If the present stimulus has something in {453} common with the stimulus which has in the past
aroused a certain perception, we may make the same response now as we did before--especially,
of course, if the present mantel set favors this response.

A good instance of this type is the "proofreader's illusion", so called, perhaps, because the
professional proofreader is less subjcet to it than any one else. The one most subject to it
is the author of a book, for whom it is almost impossible to find every misspelled word and
other typographical error in reading the proof. Almost every book comes out with a few such
errors, in spite of having been scanned repeatedly by several people. A couple of misprints
have purposely been left in the last few lines for the reader's benefit. If the word as printed
has enough resemblance to the right word, it arouses the same percept and enables the reader
to get the sense and pass on satisfied. {454} Before we began to pore over books and pictures,
the lines that we saw usually were the outlines of solid objects, and now it requires only
a bare diagram of lines to arouse in us the perception of a solid object seen in perspective.
An outline drawing, like those of the cube and staircase used to illustrate ambiguous perspective,
is more readily seen as a solid object than as a flat figure.

Another illusion of this general type dates away back to Aristotle. Cross two fingers, perhaps
best the second and third, and touch a marble with the crossed part of both fingers, and it
seems to be two marbles; or, you can use the side of your pencil as the stimulus. In the customary
position of the fingers, the stimuli thus received would mean two objects.

A much more modern illusion of the same general type is afforded by the moving pictures. The
pictures do not actually show an object in motion; they simply show the object in a series
of motionless positions, caught by instantaneous photography. The projector shows the series
of snap-shots in rapid succession, and conceals them by a shutter while they are shifted, so
as to avoid the blur that would occur if the picture were itself moved before the eyes. But
the series of snap-shots has so much in common with the visual stimulus got from an actually
present moving object that we make the same perceptive response. {455} The same illusion in
a rudimentary form can be produced by holding the forefinger upright three or four inches in
front of the nose, and looking at it while winking first the one eye and then the other. Looked
at with the right eye alone it appears to be more to one side and looked at with the left eye
alone it appears to be more to the other side; and when the one eye is closed and the other
simultaneously opened, the finger seems actually to move from one position to the other.

4. Illusions due to imperfect isolation of the fact to be perceived.

Here belong, probably, most of the illusions produced in the psychological laboratory by odd
combinations of lines, etc. A figure is so drawn as to make it difficult to isolate the fact
to be observed, and when the observer attempts to perceive it, he falls into error. He thinks
he is perceiving one fact, when he is perceiving another. The best example is the Müller-Lyer
figure, in which two equal lines are embellished with extra lines at their ends; you are supposed
to perceive the lengths of the two main lines, but you are very apt to take the whole figure
in the rough and perceive the distances between its chief parts. You do not succeed in isolating
the precise fact you wish to observe.

{456}

The Müller-Lyer Illusion

The most familiar form of this striking illusion is made with arrow heads, thus

In attempting to compare the two horizontal lines one is confused so as to regard the line
with outward-extending obliques longer than that with inward-extending obliques, though, measured
from point to point, they are equal. The same illusion occurs in a variety of similar figures,
such as

where the main lines are not drawn, but the distances from point to point are to be compared;
or such as

where the two distances between points are again to be compared. Angles, however, are not necessary
to give the illusion, as can be seen in this figure

or in this

In the last the lengths to be compared extend (a) from the right-hand rim of circle 1 to the
left-hand rim of circle 2, and (b) from this last to the right-hand rim of circle 3. The same
illusion can be got with squares, or even with capital letters as

or

or

where the distances between the main vertical lines are to be compared.

Here is an another form of the same illusion

the middle lines being affected by those above and below.

{457}

Though these illusions seem like curiosities, and far from every-day experience, they really
do enter in some degree into almost every figure that is not perfectly square and simple.

Any oblique line, any complication of any sort, is pretty sure to alter the apparent proportions
and directions of the figure. A broad effect, a long effect, a skewed effect, may easily be
produced by extra lines suitably introduced into a dress, into the front of a building, or
into a design of any sort; so that the designer needs to have a practical knowledge of this
type of illusion.

Extra lines have an influence also upon esthetic perception. The esthetic effect of a given
form may be quite altered by the introduction of apparently insignificant extra lines.

{458}

Esthetic perception is very much subject to the law of combination, and to the resulting difficulty
of isolation.

One of the most interesting illusions, not being visual, can {459} only be described and not
demonstrated here.

It is called the "size-weight illusion", and may be said to be based on the old catch, "Which
is heavier, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?" Of course, we shrewdly answer, a pound's
{460} a pound. But lift them and notice how they feel! The pound of lead feels very much heavier.
To reduce this illusion to a laboratory experiment, you take two round wooden pill-boxes, one
several times as large as the other, and load them so that they both weigh the same; then ask
some one to lift them and tell which is the heavier. He will have no doubt at all that the
smaller box is the heavier; it may seem two or three times as heavy. Young children, however,
get the opposite illusion, assimilating the weight to the visual appearance; but older persons
switch over to the contrast effect, and perceive in opposition to the visual appearance. What
seems to happen in the older person is a motor adjustment for the apparent weights, as indicated
by their visual appearance, with the result that the weight of larger size is lifted more strongly
than the weight of smaller size; so that the big one comes up easily and seems light, the little
one slowly and seems heavy.

{461}

EXERCISES

1. Outline the chapter.

2. Show that the law of combination accounts both for many
   correct perceptions, and for many illusions.

3. Through which of the senses are spatial facts best perceived?

4. "At first, the baby very likely perceives a ball simply as something
   for him to handle and throw; but, through the medium of blocked
   response, he comes to perceive it more objectively, i.e., as an
   object related to other objects, and not simply related to
   himself." Explain and illustrate this statement.

5. Give an example from the field of auditory perceptions where
   "isolation" is very much in evidence.

6. Can you see any law analogous to Weber's law in the field of
   financial profit and loss? Does a dollar gained or lost seem the
   same amount, without regard to the total amount possessed?

7. Trial and error perception. Go about the room with closed eyes,
   and identify objects by touching them with the hands. Notice
   whether your first impression gives place to corrected impressions.

8. Perception of form by "active" and "passive" touch. With
   the eyes closed, try to distinguish objects of different shapes (a)
   by letting them simply rest upon the skin, and (b) by handling
   them. What senses coöperate in furnishing data for "active touch"?

9. Binocular parallax, or the differing views of the same solid object
   obtained by the two eyes. Hold a small, three-dimensional object a
   foot in front of the face, and notice carefully the view of it
   obtained by each eye separately. A pencil, pointing towards the
   face, gives very different views. What becomes of the two monocular
   views when both eyes are open at once?

10. Binocular compared with monocular perception of "depth"
    or distance away. Take a pencil in each hand, and bring the points
    together a foot in front of the face, while only one eye is open.
    When the points seem to be nearly touching, open the other eye,
    and see whether the two points still seem to be close together.
    Repeat.

CHAPTER XVIII

REASONING

THE PROCESS OF MENTAL, AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MOTOR EXPLORATION

We are still on the general topic of "discovery". Indeed, we are still on the topic of perception;
we come now to that form of perception which is different from sense perception. The reasoner
is an explorer, and the culmination of his explorations is the perception of some fact previously
unknown to him.

Reasoning might be described as mental exploration, and distinguished from purely motor exploration
of the trial and error variety. Suppose you need the hammer, and go to the place where it is
kept, only to find it gone. Now if you simply proceed to look here and there, ransacking the
house without any plan, that would be motor exploration. But if, finding this trial and error
procedure to be laborious and almost hopeless, you sit down and think, "Where can that hammer
be? Probably where I used it last!" you may recall using it for a certain purpose, in a certain
place, go there and find it. You have substituted mental exploration of the situation for purely
motor exploration, and saved time and effort. Such instances show the use of reasoning, and
the part it plays in behavior.

The process of reasoning is also illustrated very well in these simple cases. It is an exploratory
process, a searching for facts. In a way, it is a trial and error process. If you don't ransack
the house, at least you ransack your memory, in search for facts that will assist you. You
recall this fact {463} and that, you turn this way and that, mentally, till some fact is recalled
that serves your need. No more in reasoning than in motor exploration can you hope to go straight
to the desired goal.

Animal and Human Exploration

Is man the only reasoning animal? The experimental work on animal learning, reviewed in one
of our earlier chapters, was begun with this question in mind. Previous evidence on this point
had been limited to anecdotes, such as that of the dog that was found opening a gate by lifting
the latch with his nose, and was supposed to have seen men open the gate in this way, and to
have reasoned that if a man could do that, why not a dog? The objection to this sort of evidence
is that the dog's manner of acquiring the trick was not observed. Perhaps he reasoned it out,
and perhaps he got it by accident--you cannot tell without watching the process of learning.
You must experiment, by taking a dog that does not know the trick, and perhaps first "showing
him" how to open the gate by lifting the latch; but it was found that dogs and cats, and even
monkeys, could not learn the trick in this way. If, however, you placed a dog in a cage, the
door of which could be opened by lifting a latch, and motivated the dog strongly by having
him hungry and placing food just outside, then the dog went to work by trial and error, and
lifted the latch in the course of his varied reactions; and if he were placed back in the cage
time after time, his unsuccessful reactions were gradually eliminated and the successful reaction
was firmly attached to the situation of being in that cage, so that he would finally lift the
latch without any hesitation.

The behavior of the animal does not look like reasoning. For one thing, it is too impulsive
and motor. The typical {464} attitudes of the reasoner, whether "lost in thought" or "studying
over things", do not appear in the dog, or even in the monkey, though traces of them may perhaps
be seen in the chimpanzee and other manlike apes. Further, the animal's learning curve fails
to show sudden improvements such as in human learning curves follow "seeing into" the problem.
In short, there is nothing to indicate that the animal recalls facts previously observed or
sees their bearing on the problem in hand. He works by motor exploration, instead of mental.
He does not search for "considerations" that may furnish a clue.

The behavior of human beings, placed figuratively in a cage, sometimes differs very little
from that of an animal. Certainly it shows plenty of trial and error and random motor exploration;
and often the puzzle is so blind that nothing but motor exploration will bring the solution.
What the human behavior does show that is mostly absent from the animal is (1) attentive studying
over the problem, scrutinizing it on various sides, in the effort to find a clue; (2) thinking,
typically with closed eyes or abstracted gaze, in the effort to recall something that may bear
on the problem; and (3) sudden "insights" when the present problem is seen in the light of
past experience.

Though reason differs from animal trial and error in these respects, it still is a tentative,
try-and-try-again process. The right clue is not necessarily hit upon at the first try; usually
the reasoner finds one clue after another, and follows each one up by recall, only to get nowhere,
till finally he notices a sign that recalls a pertinent meaning. His exploration of the situation,
though carried on by aid of recalled experience instead of by locomotion, still resembles finding
the way out of a maze with many blind alleys. In short, reasoning may be called a trial and
error process in the sphere of mental reactions.

{465}

The reader familiar with geometry, which is distinctly a reasoning science, can readily verify
this description. It is true that the demonstrations are set down in the book in a thoroughly
orderly manner, proceeding straight from the given assumption to the final conclusion; but
such a demonstration is only a dried specimen and does not by any means picture the living
mental process of reasoning out a proposition. Solving an "original" is far from a straight-forward
process. You begin with a situation (what is "given") involving a problem (what is to be proved),
and, studying over this lay-out you notice a certain fact which looks like a clue; this recalls
some previous proposition which gives the significance of the clue, but often turns out to
have no bearing on the problem, so that you shift to another clue; and so on, by what is certainly
a trial and error process, till some fact noted in the situation plus some knowledge recalled
by this fact, taken together, reveal the truth of the proposition.

Reasoning Culminates in Inference

When you have described reasoning as a process of mental exploration, you have told only half
the story. The successful reasoner not only seeks, but finds. He not only ransacks his memory
for data bearing on his problem, but he finally "sees" the solution clearly. The whole exploratory
process culminates in a perceptive reaction. What he "sees" is not presented to his senses
at the moment, but he "sees that something must be so". This kind of perception may be called
inference.

To bring out distinctly the perceptive reaction in reasoning, let us cite a few very simple
cases. Two freshmen in college, getting acquainted, ask about each other's fathers and find
that both are alumni of this same college. "What class was your father in?" "In the class of
1900. And {466} yours?" "Why, he was in 1900, too. Our fathers were in the same class; they
must know each other!" Here two facts, one contributed by one person and the other by another
person, enable both to perceive a third fact which neither of them knew before. Inference,
typically, is a response to two facts, and the response consists in perceiving a third fact
that is bound up in the other two.

You do not infer what you can perceive directly by the senses. If Mary and Kate are standing
side by side, you can see which is the taller. But if they are not side by side, but Mary's
height is given as so much and Kate's as an inch more, then from these two facts you know,
by inference, that Kate is taller than Mary.

"Have we set the table for the right number of people?" "Well, we can see when the party comes
to the table." "Oh! but we can tell now by counting. How many are there to be seated? One,
two, three--fifteen in all. Now count the places at table--only fourteen. You will have to
make room for one more." This reducing of the problem to numbers and then seeing how the numbers
compare is one very simple and useful kind of inference.

Indirect comparison may be accomplished by other similar devices. I can reach around this tree
trunk, but not around that, and thus I perceive that the second tree is thicker than the first,
even though it may not look so. If two things are each found to be equal to a third thing,
then I see they must be equal to each other; if one is larger than my yardstick and the other
smaller, then I see they must be unequal.

Of the two facts which, taken together, yield an inferred fact, one is often a general rule
or principle, and the inference then consists in seeing how the general rule applies to a special
case. A dealer offers you a fine-looking diamond ring for five dollars, but you recall the
rule that "all genuine diamonds are expensive", and perceive that this {467} diamond must be
an imitation. This also is an instance of indirect comparison, the yardstick being the sum
of five dollars; this ring measures five dollars, but any genuine diamond measures more than
five dollars, and therefore a discrepancy is visible between this diamond and a genuine diamond.
You can't see the discrepancy by the eye, but you see it by way of indirect comparison, just
as you discover the difference between the heights of Mary and Kate by aid of the yardstick.

If all French writers are clear, then Binet, a French writer, must be clear. Here "French writers"
furnish your yardstick. Perhaps it would suit this case a little better if, instead of speaking
of indirect comparison by aid of a mental yardstick, we spoke in terms of "relations". When
you have before your mind the relation of A to M, and also the relation of B to M, you may
be able to see, or infer, a relation between A and B. M is the common point of reference to
which A and B are related. Binet stands in a certain relation to "French writers", who furnish
the point of reference; that is, he is one of them. Clear writing stands in a certain relation
to French writers, being one of their qualities; from which combination of relations we perceive
clear writing as a quality of Binet.

Just as an illusion is a false sense perception, so a false inference is called a "fallacy".
One great cause of fallacies consists in the confused way in which facts are sometimes presented,
resulting in failure to see the relationships clearly. If you read that

  "Smith is taller than Brown; and
  Jones is shorter than Smith; and therefore
  Jones is shorter than Brown,"

the mix-up of "taller" and "shorter" makes it difficult to get the relationships clearly before
you, and you are likely {468} to make a mistake. Or again, if Mary and Jane both resemble Winifred,
can you infer that they resemble each other? You are likely to think so at first, till you
notice that resemblance is not a precise enough relation to serve for purposes of indirect
comparison. Mary may resemble Winifred in one respect, and Jane may resemble her in another
respect, and there may be no resemblance between Mary and Jane.

Or, again,

  "All French writers are clear; but
  James was not a French writer; and therefore
  James was not a clear writer,"

may cause some confusion from failure to notice that the relation between French writers and
clear writing is not reversible so that we could turn about and assert that all clear writers
were French.

The reasoner needs a clear head and a steady mental eye; he needs to look squarely and steadily
at his two given statements in order to perceive their exact relationship. Diagrams and symbols
often assist in keeping the essential facts clear of extraneous matter, and so facilitate the
right response.

To sum up: the process of reasoning culminates in two facts being present as stimuli, and the
response, called "inference", consists in perceiving a third fact that is implicated in the
two stimulus-facts. It is a good case of the law of combination, and at the same time it is
a case where "isolation" is needed, otherwise the response will be partly aroused by irrelevant
stimuli, and thus be liable to error.

Varieties of Reasoning

Reasoning as a whole is a process of mental exploration culminating in inference. Now, without
regard to possible {469} variations of the perceptive response of inference, there are at least
different varieties of the exploratory process leading up to inference. The situation that
arouses reasoning differs from one case to another, the motive for engaging in this rather
laborious mental process differs, and the order of events in the process differs. There are
several main types of reasoning, considered as a process of mental exploration.

1. Reasoning out the solution of a practical problem.

A "problem" is a situation for which we have no ready and successful response. We cannot successfully
respond by instinct or by previously acquired habit. We must find out what to do. We explore
the situation, partly by the senses and actual movement, partly by the use of our wits. We
observe facts in the situation that recall previous experiences or previously learned rules
and principles, and apply these to the present case. Many of these clues we reject at once
as of no use; others we may try out and find useless; some we may think through and thus find
useless; but finally, if our exploration is successful, we observe a real clue, recall a pertinent
guiding principle, and see the way out of our problem.

Two boys went into the woods for a day's outing. They climbed about all the morning, and ate
their lunch in a little clearing by the side of a brook. Then they started for home, striking
straight through the woods, as they thought, in the direction of home. After quite a long tramp,
when they thought they should be about out of the woods, they saw clear space ahead, and, pushing
forward eagerly, found themselves in the same little clearing where they had eaten their lunch!
Reasoning process No. 1 now occurred: one of the boys recalled that when traversing the woods
without any compass or landmark, the traveller is very likely to go in a circle; inference,
"That is what we have done and {470} we probably shall do the same thing again if we go ahead.
We may as well sit down and think it over."

Mental exploration ensued. "How about following the brook?" "That won't do, for it flows down
into a big swamp that we couldn't get through". "How about telling directions by the sun?"
"But it has so clouded over that you can't tell east from west, or north from south." "Yes,
those old clouds! How fast they are going! They seem to go straight enough." "Well, say! How
about following the clouds? If we keep on going straight, in any direction, for a couple of
hours, we shall surely get out of the woods somewhere." This seems worth trying and actually
brings the boys out to a road where they can inquire the way home.

What we find in this case is typical of problem solution. First, a desire is aroused, and it
facilitates the observation and recall of facts relevant to itself. One pertinent fact is observed,
another pertinent fact, or rule, is recalled; and in these two taken together the key to the
problem is found.

2. Rationalization or self-justification.

While in the preceding case reasoning showed what to do, here it is called upon to justify
what has been done, or what is going to be done anyway. The question is, what reason to assign
for the act; we feel the need of meeting criticism, either from other people or from ourselves.
The real motive for the act may be unknown to ourselves, as it often is unless we have made
a careful study of motives; or, if known, it may not be such as we care to confess. We require
a reasonable motive, some acceptable general principle that explains our action.

A child is unaccountably polite and helpful to his mother some day, and when asked about it
replies that he simply wants to help--while his real motive may have been to score against
his brother or sister, who is to some extent his rival.

{471}

If I have work requiring attention but want to go to the game, I should certainly be lacking
in reasoning ability if I could not find something in the situation that made my attendance
at the game imperative. I am stale, and the game will freshen me up and make me work better
afterward. Or, I am in serious danger of degenerating into a mere "grind", and must fight against
this evil tendency. Or, my presence at the game is necessary in order to encourage the team.

Thus, aspects of the situation that are in line with our desire bob to the surface and suggest
acceptable general principles that make the intended action seem good and even necessary. Finding
excuses for acts already performed is a reasoning exercise of the same sort. Man is a rationalizing
animal as well as a rational animal, and his self-justifications and excuses, ludicrous though
they often are, are still a tribute to his very laudable appreciation of rationality.

3. Explanation.

This form of reasoning, like the preceding, takes its start with something that raises the
question, "Why?" Only, our interest in the question is objective rather than subjective. It
is not our own actions that call for explanation, but some fact of nature or of human behavior.
Why--with apologies to the Southern Hemisphere!--is it so cold in January? The fact arouses
our curiosity. We search the situation for clues, and recall past information, just as in the
attempt to solve a practical problem. "Is it because there is so much snow in January?" "But
what, then, makes it snow? This clue leads us in a circle." "Perhaps, then, it is because the
sun shines so little of the time, and never gets high in the sky, even at noon." That is a
pretty good clue; it recalls the general principle that, without a continued supply of heat,
cold is inevitable. To explain a phenomenon is to deduce it from {472} an accepted general
principle; to understand it is to see it as an instance of the general principle. Such understanding
is very satisfactory, since it rids you of uncertainty and sometimes from fear, and gives you
a sense of power and mastery.

4. Application.

The reasoning processes discussed up to this point have taken their start with the particular,
and have been concerned in a search for the general principle that holds good of the given
particular case. Reasoning may also take its start at the other end, in a general statement,
and seek for particular cases belonging under this general rule. But what can be the motive
for this sort of reasoning? What is there about a general proposition to stimulate exploration?

Several motives may be in play. First, there may be a need for application of the general principle.
Somebody whose authority you fully accept enunciates a general proposition, and you wish to
apply it to special cases, either for seeing what practical use you can make of it, or simply
to make its meaning more real and concrete to yourself. Your exploration here takes a different
form from that thus far described. Instead of searching a concrete situation for clues, and
your memory for general principles, you search your memory for particular cases where the general
law should apply. If all animals are cold-blooded, excepting only birds and mammals, then fish
and frogs and lizards are cold-blooded, spiders, insects, lobsters and worms; having drawn
these inferences, your understanding of the general proposition becomes more complete.

5. Doubt.

A general proposition may stimulate reasoning because you doubt it, and wish to find cases
where it breaks down. Perhaps somebody makes the general statement whose authority you do not
accept; perhaps he says it in an assertive way that makes you want to take him down {473} a
peg. Perhaps you are in the heat of an argument with him, so that every assertion he may make
is a challenge. You search your memory for instances belonging under the doubted general statement,
in the hope of finding one where the general statement leads to a result that is contrary to
fact. "You say that all politicians are grafters. Theodore Roosevelt was a politician, therefore,
according to you, he must have been a grafter. But he was not a grafter, and you will have
to take back that sweeping assertion."

6. Verification.

This same general type of reasoning, which takes its start with a general proposition, and
explores particular instances in order to see whether the proposition, when applied to them,
gives a result in accordance with the facts, has much more serious uses; for this is the method
by which a hypothesis is tested in science. A hypothesis is a general proposition put forward
as a guess, subject to verification. If it is thoroughly verified, it will be accepted as a
true statement, a "law of nature", but at the outset it is only a guess that may turn out to
be either true or false. How shall its truth or falsity be demonstrated? By deducing its consequences,
and testing these out in the realm of observed fact.

An example from the history of science is afforded by Harvey's discovery of the circulation
of the blood, which was at first only a hypothesis, and a much-doubted one at that. If the
blood is driven by the heart through the arteries, and returns to the heart by way of the veins,
then the flow of blood in any particular artery must be away from the heart, and in any particular
vein towards the heart. This deduction was readily verified. Further, there should be little
tubes leading from the smallest arteries over into the smallest veins, and this discovery also
was later verified, when the invention of the microscope made observation of the capillaries
possible. Other deductions also were verified, {474} and in short all deductions from the hypothesis
were verified, and the circulation of the blood became an accepted law.

Most hypotheses are not so fortunate as this one; most of them die by the wayside, since it
is much easier to make a guess that shall fit the few facts we already know than to make one
that will apply perfectly to many other facts at present unknown. A hypothesis is a great stimulus
to the discovery of fresh facts. Science does not like to have unverified hypotheses lying
around loose, where they may trip up the unwary. It is incumbent on any one who puts forward
a hypothesis to apply it to as many special cases as possible, in order to see whether it works
or not; and if the propounder of the hypothesis is so much in love with it that he fails to
give it a thorough test, his scientific colleagues are sure to come to the rescue, for they,
on the whole, would be rather pleased to see the other fellow's hypothesis come to grief. In
this way, the rivalry motive plays a useful part in the progress and stabilizing of science.

Deductive and Inductive Reasoning

When you are sure at the outset of your general proposition, and need only to see its application
to special cases, your reasoning is said to be "deductive". Such reasoning is specially used
in mathematics. But in natural science you are said to employ "inductive reasoning". The process
has already been described. You start with particular facts demanding explanation or generalization,
and try to find some accepted law that explains them. Failing in that, you are driven to guess
at a general law, i.e., to formulate a hypothesis that will fit the known facts. Then, having
found such a conjectural general law, you proceed to deduce its consequences; you see that,
if the hypothesis is true, such and such facts must be true. Next you go out and see whether
these facts are true, and if they are, your hypothesis {475} is verified to that extent, though
it may be upset later. If the deduced facts are not true, the hypothesis is false, and you
have to begin all over again.

The would-be natural scientist may fail at any one of several points. First, he may see no
question that calls for investigation. Everything seems a matter-of-course, and he concludes
that science is complete, with nothing left for him to discover. Second, seeing something that
still requires explanation, he may lack fertility in guessing, or may be a poor guesser and
set off on a wild-goose chase. Helmholtz, an extremely fertile inventor of high-grade hypotheses,
describes how he went about it. He would load up in the morning with all the knowledge he could
assemble on the given question, and go out in the afternoon for a leisurely ramble; when, without
any strenuous effort on his part, the various facts would get together in new combinations
and suggest explanations that neither he nor any one else had ever thought of before. Third,
our would-be scientific investigator may lack the clear, steady vision to see the consequences
of his hypothesis; and, fourth, he may lack the enterprise to go out and look for the facts
that his hypothesis tells him should be found.

Psychology and Logic

Psychology is not the only science that studies reasoning; that is the subject-matter of logic
as well, and logic was in the field long before psychology. Psychology studies the process
of reasoning, while logic checks up the result and shows whether it is valid or not. Logic
cares nothing about the exploratory process that culminates in inference, but limits itself
to inference alone.

Inference, in logical terminology, consists in drawing a conclusion from two given premises.
The two premises are the "two facts" which, acting together, arouse the {476} perceptive response
called inference, and the "third fact" thus perceived is the conclusion. [Footnote: The "two
facts" or premises need not be true; either or both may be assumed or hypothetical, and still
they may lead to a valid conclusion, i.e., a conclusion implicated in the assumed premises.]
Logic cares nothing as to how the premises were found, nor as to the motive that led to the
search for them, nor as to the time and effort required, nor the difficulty encountered; these
matters all pertain to psychology. Logic employs the letters, S, P, and M to symbolize these
three terms in general. S is the "subject" (or, we might say, the "object" or the "situation")
about which something is inferred. P is the "predicate", or what is inferred about S; and M
is the "middle term" which corresponds to our "yardstick" or "point of reference", as we used
those words at the beginning of the chapter. S is compared with P through the medium of M;
or, S and P are both known to be related to M, and therefore (when the relations are of the
right sort) they are related to each other. It is part of the business of logic to examine
what relations are, and what are not, suitable for yielding a valid inference.

In symbols, then, the syllogism becomes:

  Major premise: M is P
  Minor premise: S is M
  Conclusion:    Therefore, S is P

{477}

Without confounding logic and psychology in the least, we may take this symbolic syllogism
as a sort of map, on which to trace out the different exploratory processes that we have already
described under the head of "varieties of reasoning". To do so may make these different processes
stand out more distinctly.

In problem-solution, we start with S, a situation unsolved, i.e., without any P. P, when found,
will be the solution. We explore the situation, and find in it M; i.e., we observe that S is
M. Now M recalls our previously acquired knowledge that M is P. Having then before us the two
premises, we perceive that S is P, and are saved.

In rationalization or explanation, we know, to start with, that S is P, and wish to know why
this is so. As before, we explore S, find M, recall that M is P, and see that S, therefore,
is P. Our final conclusion is, really, that S is P because it is M; that January is cold because
it gets little sunlight.

In application, doubt or verification, we start with the major premise, M is P, and explore
our memories for an S which, being M, should therefore be P according to our hypothesis. If
we find an S which is not P, then our final conclusion is that the major premise is false.

Reference to our "map" indicates that there might be several other varieties of reasoning,
and there are, indeed, though they are scarcely as important as those already mentioned. Reasoning
sometimes starts with the observation of P, which means something that might prove useful on
some future occasion. Your attention is caught by these prominent words in an advertisement,
"$100 a week!" That might come in handy on some future occasion, and you look further to see
how all that money can be attached to S, yourself on some future occasion. You soon learn that
you have only to secure subscriptions for a certain magazine, {478} and that income may be
yours. P is the money, and M is the occupation that gives the money, while S is yourself supposedly
entering on this occupation and earning the money. This type of reasoning is really quite common.
If we see a person making a great success of anything, we try to discover how he does it, reasoning
that if we do the same, we shall also be successful; or, if we see some one come to grief,
we try to see how it happened, so as to avoid his mistake and so the bad consequences of that
mistake. We plan to perform M so as to secure P, or to avoid M in the hope of avoiding P.

Sometimes, not so rarely, we have both premises handed out to us and have only to draw the
conclusion. More often, we hear a person drawing a conclusion from only one expressed premise,
and try to make out what the missing premise can be. Sometimes this is easy, as when one says,
"I like him because he is always cheerful", from which you see that the person speaking must
like cheerful persons. But if you hear it said that such a one "cannot be a real thinker, he
is so positive in his opinions" or that another "is unfeeling and unsympathetic from lack of
a touch of cruelty in his nature", you may have to explore about considerably before finding
acceptable major premises from which such conclusions can be deduced.

Finally, in asking what are the qualifications of a good reasoner we can help ourselves once
more by reference to the syllogistic map. To reason successfully on a given topic, you need
good major premises, good minor premises, and valid conclusions therefrom.

(a) A good stock of major premises is necessary, a good stock of rules and principles acquired
in previous experience. Without some knowledge of a subject, you have only vague generalities
to draw upon, and your reasoning process will be slow and probably lead only to indefinite
conclusions. {479} Experience, knowledge, memory are important in reasoning, though they do
not by any means guarantee success.

(b) The "detective instinct" for finding the right clues, and rejecting false leads, amounts
to the same as sagacity in picking out the useful minor premises. In problem solution, you
have to find both of your premises, and often the minor premise is the first to be found and
in turn recalls the appropriate major premise. Finding the minor premise is a matter of observation,
and if you fail to observe the significant fact about the problem, the really useful major
premise may lie dormant, known and retained but not recalled, while false clues suggest inapplicable
major premises and give birth to plenty of reasoning but all to no purpose. Some persons with
abundant knowledge are ineffective reasoners from lack of a sense for probability. The efficient
reasoner must be a good guesser.

(c) The reasoner needs a clear and steady mental eye, in order to see the conclusion that is
implicated in the premises. Without this, he falls into confusion and fallacy, or fails, with
the premises both before him, to get the conclusion. The "clear and steady mental eye", in
less figurative language, means the ability to check hasty responses to either premise alone,
or to extraneous features of the situation, so as to insure that "unitary response" to the
combination of premises which constitutes the perceptive act of inference.

was highly.

 Sometimes
the hero is not the dreamer's self, but some one closely identified with himself. The mother
is prone to make her son the hero of daydreams and so to gratify her pride in him.

The "suffering hero" daydream seems at first thought inexplicable, for why should any one picture
himself as having a bad time, as misunderstood by his best friends, ill-treated by his family,
jilted by his best girl, unsuccessful in his pet schemes? Why should any one make believe to
be worse off than he is; what satisfaction can that {495} be to him? Certainly, one would say,
the mastery motive could not be active here. And yet--do we not hear children boasting of their
misfortunes? "Pooh! That's only a little scratch; I've got a real deep cut." My cut being more
important than your scratch makes me, for the moment, more important than you, and gives me
a chance to boast over you. Older people are known sometimes to magnify their own ailments,
with the apparent aim of enhancing their own importance. Perhaps the same sort of motive underlies
the suffering hero daydream.

I am smarting, let us suppose, from a slight administered by my friend; my wounded self-assertion
demands satisfaction. It was a very little slight, and I should make myself ridiculous if I
showed my resentment. But in imagination I magnify the injury done me, and go on to picture
a dreadful state of affairs, in which my friend has treated me very badly indeed, and perhaps
deserted me. Then I should not be ridiculous, but so deeply wronged as to be an important person,
one to be talked about; and thus my demand for importance and recognition is gratified by my
daydream.

Usually the suffering hero pictures himself as in the right, and animated by the noblest intentions,
though misunderstood, and thus further enhances his self-esteem; but sometimes he takes the
other tack and pictures himself as wicked--but as very, very wicked, a veritable desperado.
It may be his self-esteem has been wounded by blame for some little meanness or disobedience,
and he restores it by imagining himself a great, big, important sinner instead of a small and
ridiculous one. In adolescence, the individual's growing demand for independence is often balked
by the continued domination of his elders, and he rebelliously plans quite a career of crime
for himself. He'll show them! They won't be so pig-headedly complacent when they know they
have driven him to the bad. You can tell by the looks of {496} a person whose feelings are
hurt that he is imagining something; usually he is imagining himself either a martyr or a desperado,
or some other kind of suffering hero, often working up into a conquering hero in the end, when,
his self-esteem restored, he is ready to be friends again. The suffering hero daydream is a
"substitute reaction", taking the place of a fight or some other active self-assertion. The
conquering hero daydream is often motivated in the same way; for example, our friend the milkmaid
would not have been so ready to scorn the young men with a toss of the head if she had not
been feeling her own actual inferiority and lack of fine clothes. The daydream makes good,
in one way or another, for actual inability to get what we desire. The desire which is gratified
in the play of imagination belongs very often indeed under the general head of self-assertion;
but when one is in love it is apt to belong under that head. Love dreams of the agreeable sort
need no further motivation; but the unpleasant, jealous type of love dream is at the same time
a suffering hero dream, and certainly involves wounded self-assertion along with the sexual
impulse. Probably the self-asserting daydream is the commonest variety, take mankind as a whole,
with the love dream next in order of frequency. But there are many other sorts. There is the
humor daydream, illustrated by the young person who suddenly breaks into a laugh and when you
ask why replies that she was thinking how funny it would be if, etc., etc. She is very fond
of a good laugh, and not having anything laughable actually at hand proceeds to imagine something.
So, a music lover may mentally rehearse a piece when he has no actual music to enjoy; and if
he has some power of musical invention, he may amuse himself, in idle moments, by making up
music in his head; just as one who has some ability in decorative design may fill his idle
moments by concocting new designs on paper. {497} When vacation time approaches, it is hard
for any one, student or professor, to keep the thoughts from dwelling on the good times ahead,
and getting some advance satisfaction. Thus all kinds of desires are gratified in imagination.

Worry

Do we have fear daydreams, as we have amusements utilizing the fear and escape motive? Yes,
sometimes we imagine ourselves in danger and plan out an escape. One individual often amuses
himself by imagining he is arrested and accused of some crime, and figuring out how he could
establish an alibi or otherwise prove his innocence. But fear daydreams also include worry,
which seems at first to be an altogether unpleasant state of mind, forced upon us and not indulged
in as most daydreams are. Yet, as the worry is often entirely needless, it cannot be said to
be forced upon a person, but must have some motive. There must be some satisfaction in it,
in spite of all appearance.

Some abnormal cases of worry suggest the theory that the fear is but a cloak for unacknowledged
desire. Take this extreme case. A young man, "tied to the apron-strings" of a too affectionate
and too domineering mother, has a strong desire to break loose and be an independent unit in
the world; but at the same time, being much attached to his mother, he is horrified by this
desire. She goes on a railroad journey without him--just an ordinary journey with no special
danger--but all the time she is away he is in an agony of suspense lest the train may be wrecked.
Such an abnormal degree of worry calls for explanation. Well--did not the worry perhaps conceal
a wish, a wish that the train might be wrecked? So he would be set free without any painful
effort on his part; and he {498} was a young man who shrank from all effort. The psychopathologist
who studied the case concluded that this was really the explanation of the worry.

If, however, we take such extreme cases as typical and cynically apply this conception to all
worries, we shall make many mistakes. A student worries unnecessarily about an examination;
therefore, he desires to fail. A mother worries because her child is late in getting home;
therefore, she wants to be rid of that child. Thus, by being too psychopathological, we reach
many absurd conclusions in everyday life; for it is the child that is loved that is worried
over, and it is the examination that the student specially wishes to pass that he fears he
has flunked.

Worry is a sort of substitute reaction, taking the place of real action when no real action
is possible. The student has done all he can do; he has prepared for the examination, and he
has taken the examination; now there is nothing to do except wait; so that the rational course
would be to dismiss the matter from his mind; if he cannot accomplish that, but must do something,
then the only thing he can do is to speculate and worry. So also the mother, in her uncertainty
regarding her child, is impelled to action, and if she knew of any real thing to do she would
do it and not worry; but there is nothing to do, except in imagination. Worry is fundamentally
due to the necessity of doing something with any matter that occupies our mind; it is an imaginative
substitute for real action.

But worry may be something of an indoor sport as well. Consider this--if the mother really
believed her child had fallen into the pond, she would rush to pull him out; but while she
is worrying for fear he may have fallen in, she remains at home. Really she expects to see
him come home any minute, but by conjuring up imaginary dangers she is getting ready to make
his home-coming a great relief instead {499} of a mere humdrum matter. She is "shooting the
chutes", getting the thrill of danger with escape fully expected.

The normal time for a daydream is the time when there is no real act to be performed. A strong
man uses it as the amusement of an idle moment and promptly forgets it. But one who is lacking
in force, especially the personal force needed in dealing with other people, may take refuge
in daydreams as a substitute for real doing. Instead of hustling for the money he needs he
may, like Micawber, charm himself with imagining the good opportunities that may turn up. Instead
of going and making love to the lady of his choice, he shyly keeps away from her and merely
dreams of winning her. He substitutes imaginary situations for the real facts of his life,
and gratifies his mastery motive by imaginary exploits. He invents imaginary ailments to excuse
his lack of real deeds. He conjures up imaginary dangers to worry over. All this is abuse of
imagination.

Dreams

Let us turn now from daydreams to dreams of the night. These also are play of imagination,
even freer from control and criticism than the daydream. In sleep the cortical brain functions
sink to a low level, and perhaps cease altogether in the deepest sleep. Most of the dreams
that are coherent enough to be recalled probably occur just after we have gone to sleep or
just before we wake up, or at other times when sleep is light. At such times the simpler and
more practised functions, such as recall of images, can go on, though criticism, good judgment,
reasoning, and all that sort of delicate and complex activity, do not occur. Daytime standards
of probability, decorum, beauty, wit, and excellence of any sort are in abeyance; consistency
is thrown to the winds, the scenes being shifted in the middle of a {500} speech, and a character
who starts in as one person merging presently into somebody else. Dreams follow the definition
of imagination or invention, in that materials recalled from different contexts are put together
into combinations and rearrangements never before experienced. The combinations are often bizarre
and incongruous.

Perhaps the most striking characteristic of dreams is their seeming reality while they last.
They seem real in spite of their incongruity, because of the absence of critical ability during
sleep. In waking life, when the sight of one object reminds me of another and calls up an image
of that other, I know that the image is an image, and I know I have thought of two different
things. In sleep the same recall by association occurs, but the image is forthwith accepted
as real; and thus things from different sources get together in the same dream scene, and a
character who reminds us of another person forthwith becomes that other person. We are not
mentally active enough in sleep to hold our images apart. Associative recall, with blending
of the recalled material, and with entire absence of criticism, describes the process of dreaming.

What is the stimulus, to which the dream responds? Sometimes there is an actual sensory stimulus,
like the alarm clock or a stomach ache; and in this case the dream comes under the definition
of an illusion; it is a false perception, more grotesquely false than most illusions of the
day. A boy wakes up one June morning from a dream of the Day of Judgement, with the last trump
pealing forth and blinding radiance all about--only to find, when fully awake, that the sun
is shining in his face and the brickyard whistle blowing the hour of four-thirty a.m. This
was a false perception. More often, a dream resembles a daydream in being a train of thoughts
and images without much relation to present sensory stimuli; and then the dream {501} would
come under the definition of hallucination instead of illusion.

Sometimes a sensory stimulus breaks in upon a dream that is in progress, and is interpreted
in the light of this dream. In one experiment, the dreamer, who was an authoress, was in the
midst of a dream in which she was discussing vacation plans with a party of friends, when the
experimenter disturbed her by declaiming a poem; in her dream this took the form of a messenger
from her publisher, reciting something about a contract which seemed a little disturbing but
which she hoped (in the dream) would not interfere with her vacation. Maury, an early student
of this topic, was awakened from a feverish dream of the French Revolution by something falling
on his neck; this, under the circumstances, he took to be the guillotine.

Now, why is a dream? What satisfaction does it bring to the dreamer? Or shall we say that it
is merely a mechanical play of association, with no motivation behind it? Dreams are interesting
while they last, sometimes fearful, sometimes angry, sometimes amorous, otherwise not very
emotional but distinctly interesting, so that many people hate to have a dream broken up by
awaking. It seems likely, then, that dreams are like daydreams in affording gratification to
desires. They are "wish-fulfilling", to borrow a term from Freud's theory of dreams, soon to
be considered.

A boy dreams repeatedly of finding whole barrels of assorted jackknives, and is bitterly disappointed
every time to awake and find the knives gone; so that finally he questions the reality of the
dream, but pinching himself (in the dream) concludes he must be awake this time. An adult frequently
dreams of finding money, first a nickel in the dust, and then a quarter close by, and then
more and more, till he wakes up and spoils it all. Such dreams are {502} obviously wish-fulfilling,
as are also the sex dreams of sexually abstinent persons, or the feasting dreams of starving
persons, or the polar explorer's recurring dream of warm, green fields. An eminent psychologist
has given a good account of a dream which he had while riding in an overcrowded compartment
of a European train, with the window closed and himself wedged in tightly far from the window.
In this uncomfortable situation he dropped asleep and dreamed that he had the seat next to
the window, had the window open and was looking out at a beautiful landscape. In all these
cases the wish gratified in the dream is one that has been left unsatisfied in the daytime,
and this is according to the famous passage, slightly paraphrased, "What a man hath, why doth
he yet dream about?" The newly married couple do not dream of each other. We seldom dream of
our regular work, unless for some reason we are disturbed over it. The tendencies that are
satisfied during the day do not demand satisfaction in dreams; but any tendency that is aroused
during the day without being able to reach its conclusion is likely to come to the surface
in a dream.

Any sort of desire or need, left unsatisfied in the day, may motivate a dream. Desire for food,
warmth, sex gratification, air, money, etc., have been exemplified in dreams already cited.
Curiosity may be the motive, as in the case of an individual, who, having just come to live
in Boston, was much interested in its topography, and who saw one day a street car making off
in what seemed to him a queer direction, so that he wondered where it could be going and tried
unsuccessfully to read its sign. The next night he dreamed of seeing the car near at hand and
reading the sign, which, though really consisting of nonsense names, satisfied his curiosity
during the dream.

The mastery motive, so prominent in daydreams, can be detected also in many sleep dreams. There
are dreams in {503} which we do big things--tell excruciatingly funny jokes, which turn out
when recalled next day to be utterly flat; or improvise the most beautiful music, which we
never can recall with any precision, but which probably amounted to nothing; or play the best
sort of baseball. The gliding or flying dream, which many people have had, reminds one of the
numerous toys and sports in which defiance of gravity is the motive; and certainly it gives
you a sense of power and freedom to be able, in a dream, to glide gracefully up a flight of
stairs, or step with ease from the street upon the second-story balcony. One dream which at
first thought cannot be wish-fulfilling perhaps belongs under the mastery motive: The dreamer
sees people scurrying to cover, looks up and sees a thunderstorm impending; immediately he
is struck by lightning and knocked down in the street; but he finds he can rise and walk home,
and seems to have suffered no harm except for a black blotch around one eye. Now, any man who
could take lightning that way would be proud to wear the scar. So the dream was wish-fulfilling,
and the wish involved was, as often, the self-assertive impulse.

This last dream is a good one, however, for pointing another moral. We need not suppose that
the dreamer was aiming at the denouement from the beginning of the dream. Dreams have no plot
in most instances; they just drift along, as one thing suggests another. The sight of people
running to cover suggested a thunderstorm, and that suggested that "I might get struck", as
it would in the daytime. Now, the dream mentality, being short on criticism, has no firm hold
on "may be" and "might be", but slides directly into the present indicative. The thought of
being struck is being struck, in a dream. So we do not need to suppose that the dreamer pictured
himself as struck by lightning in order to have the satisfaction of coming off {504} whole
and bragging of the exploit. In large measure the course of a dream is determined by free association;
but the mastery motive and other easily awakened desires act as a sort of bias, facilitating
certain outcomes and inhibiting others.

But there are unpleasant dreams, as well as pleasant. There are fear dreams, as well as wish
dreams. A child who is afraid of snakes and constantly on the alert against them when out in
the fields during the day, dreams repeatedly of encountering a mass of snakes and is very much
frightened in his sleep. Another child dreams of wolves or tigers. A person who has been guilty
of an act from which bad consequences are possible dreams that those consequences are realized.
The officer suffering from nervous war strain, or "shell shock", often had nightmares in which
he was attacked and worsted by the enemy. Since Freud has never admitted that dreams could
be fear-motived, holding that here, as in worry, the fear is but a cloak for a positive desire,
some of his followers have endeavored to interpret these shell-shock nightmares as meaning
a desire to be killed and so escape from the strain. To be consistent, they would have also
to hold that the child, who of all people is the most subject to terrifying dreams, secretly
desires death, though not avowing this wish even to himself. This would be pushing consistency
rather far, and it is better to admit that there are real fear dreams, favored by indigestion
or nervous strain, but sometimes occurring simply by the recall of a fear-stimulus in the same
way that anything is recalled, i.e., through association.

A large share of dreams does not fit easily into any of the classes already described. They
seem too fantastic to have any personal meaning. Yet they are interesting to the dreamer, and
they would be worth going to see if they could be reproduced and put on the stage. Isn't that
sufficient {505} excuse for them? May they not be simply a free play of imagination that gives
interesting results because of its very freedom from any control or tendency, and because of
the vividness of dream imagery?

Freud's Theory of Dreams

Just at this point we part company with Freud, whose ideas on dreams as wish-fulfilments we
have been following, in the main. Not that Freud would OK our account of dreams up to this
point. Far from it. It would seem to him on too superficial a level altogether, dealing as
it does with conscious wishes and with straightforward fulfilments. It has left out of account
the "Unconscious" and its symbolisms. The Freudian would shake his head at our interpretation
of the lightning dream, and say, "Oh, there is a good deal more in that dream. We should have
to analyze that dream, by letting the dreamer dwell on each item of it and asking himself what
of real personal significance the stroke of lightning or the scar around the eye suggested
to him. He would never be able by his unaided efforts to find the unconscious wishes fulfilled
in the dream, but under the guidance of the psychoanalyst, who is a specialist in all matters
pertaining to the Unconscious, he may be brought to realize that his dream is the symbolic
expression of wishes that are unconscious because they have been suppressed".

The Unconscious, according to Freud, consists of forbidden wishes--wishes forbidden by the
"Censor", which represents the moral and social standards of the individual and his critical
judgment generally. When the Censor suppresses a wish, it does not peaceably leave the system
but sinks to an unconscious state in which it is still active and liable to make itself felt
in ways that get by the Censor because they are disguised and symbolic. An abnormal worry {506}
is such a disguise, a queer idea that haunts the nervous person is another, "hysterical" paralysis
or blindness is another.

In normal individuals the dream life is held by Freud to be the chief outlet for the suppressed
wishes; for then the Censor sleeps and "the mice can play". Even so, they dare not show themselves
in their true shape and color, but disguise themselves in innocent-appearing symbolism. That
lightning may stand for something much more personal. Let your mind play about that "being
knocked down by lightning and getting up again", and ask yourself what experience of childhood
it calls up.--Well, I remember the last time my father whipped me and I came through defiant,
without breaking down as I always had before on similar occasions.--Yes, now we are on the
track of something. The lightning symbolizes your father and his authority over you, which
as a child you resented. You were specially resentful at your father's hold on your mother,
whom you regarded as yours, your father being a rival with an unfair advantage. Your sex impulse
was directed towards your mother, when you were a mere baby, but you soon came to see (how,
Freud has never clearly explained) that this was forbidden, and that your father stood in the
way. You resented this, you hated your father, while at the same time you may have loved him,
too; so this whole complex and troublesome business was suppressed to the Unconscious, whence
it bobs up every night in disguise. You may dream of the death of some one, and on analysis
that some one is found to represent your father, whom as a child you secretly wished out of
the way; or that some one may stand for your younger brother, against whom you, had a standing
grudge because he had usurped your place as the pet of the family. These childish wishes are
the core of the Unconscious and help to motivate all dreams, but more recently suppressed {507}
wishes may also be gratified in dream symbolism. A man may "covet his neighbor's wife", but
this is forbidden, unworthy, and false to the neighbor who is also his friend. The wish is
disavowed, suppressed, not allowed in the waking consciousness; but it gratifies itself symbolically
in a dream; the neighbor's wife not appearing at all in the dream, but the neighbor's automobile
instead, which the neighbor cannot run properly, while the dreamer manages it beautifully.

Freud has claimed the dream as his special booty, and insists that all dreams are wish-fulfilments,
even those that seem mere fantastic play of imagination, since, as he sees it, no mental activity
could occur except to gratify some wish. Further, he holds, most if not all dreams are fulfilments
of suppressed wishes, and these are either sex or spite wishes, the spite wishes growing out
of the interference of other people with our sex wishes.

The objection to Freud's theory of dreams is, first, that he fails to see how easy-running
the association or recall mechanism is. It isn't necessary to look for big, mysterious driving
forces, when we know that A makes you think of B, and B of C, with the greatest ease. The dreamer
isn't laboring, he is idly playing, and his images come largely by free association, with personal
desires giving some steer.

Another objection is that Freud overdoes the Unconscious; suppressed wishes are usually not
so unconscious as he describes them; they are unavowed, unnamed, unanalyzed, but conscious
for all that. It is not so much the unconscious wish that finds outlet in dreams and daydreams,
as the unsatisfied wish, which may be perfectly conscious.

Another very serious objection to Freud is that he overdoes the sex motive or "libido". He
says there are two main tendencies, that of self-preservation and that of reproduction, but
that the former is ordinarily not much subject to suppression, while the latter is very much
under the {508} social ban. Consequently the Unconscious consists mostly of suppressed sex
wishes. Evidently, however, Freud's analysis of human motives is very incomplete. He does not
clearly recognize the self-assertive tendency, which, as a matter of fact, is subjected to
much suppression from early childhood all through life, and which undoubtedly has as much to
do with dreams, as it has with daydreams. Freud has given an "impressionistic" picture, very
stimulating and provocative of further exploration, but by no means to be accepted as a true
and complete map of the region.

Autistic Thinking

Dreaming, whether awake or asleep, is free imagination. It does not have to check up with any
standard. So long as it is interesting at the moment and gratifies the dreamer in any way,
it serves its purpose. Sometimes the daydreamer exercises some control, breaking off a spiteful
or amorous dream because he thinks it had better not be indulged; but in this he ceases to
be simply a daydreamer. Daydreaming, by itself, is an example of what is called "autistic thinking",
which means thinking that is sufficient unto itself, and not subjected to any criticism. Autistic
thinking gratifies some desire and that is enough for it. It does not submit to criticism from
other persons nor from other tendencies of the individual, nor does it seek to square itself
with the real world.

Autistic thinking, indulged in by every imaginative person in moments of relaxation, is carried
to an absurd extreme by some types of insane individuals. One type withdraws so completely
from reality as to be inaccessible in the way of conversation, unresponsive to anything that
happens, entirely immersed in inner imaginings. Others, while living in the world about them,
transform it into a make-believe {509} world by attaching meanings to things and persons as
suits themselves. This institution, in which the subject is confined, is his royal palace,
the doctors are his officials, the nurses his wives, "thousands of them, the most beautiful
women in creation". Or the delusion may take the line of the "suffering hero", the subject
imagining himself a great man shut up in this place by the machinations of his enemies; the
doctors are spies and enemy agents, and the nurses also act suspiciously; his food is poisoned,
and he is kept in a weak and helpless condition, all out of fear of him. It is impossible to
argue the patient out of his delusions by pointing out to him how clearly they conflict with
reality; he evades any such test by some counter-argument, no matter how flimsy, and sticks
to his dream or make-believe.

Autistic thinking is contrasted with realistic thinking, which seeks to check up with real
facts; it may be contrasted also with socialized thinking, which submits to the criticism of
other people; and it may even be contrasted with self-criticized thinking, in which the individual
scrutinizes what he has imagined, to see whether it is on the whole satisfactory to himself,
or whether it simply gratified a single or momentary impulse that should be balanced off by
other tendencies.

Invention and Criticism

"Criticism"--the word has been used repeatedly, and it is time it gave an account of itself.
Criticism evidently demands balancing off one desire by another. One tendency gets criticized
by running afoul of another tendency, one idea by conflicting with another idea. We concoct
a fine joke to play on our friend; but then the thought comes to us that he may not take it
kindly; we don't want to break with our friend, and so we regretfully throw our promising invention
on the scrap heap. That is self-criticism, the {510} balancing off of one impulse by another.
Self-criticism is obnoxious to the natural man, who prefers to follow out any tendency that
has been aroused till it reaches its goal; but he learns self-criticism in the hard school
of experience. For plenty of criticism is directed upon the individual from without.

Criticism is directed upon him by the facts of the real world, so soon as he tries to act out
what he has imagined. Often his invention will not work, his plan does not succeed, and he
is involved in chagrin and even pain. He must perforce cast away his plan and think up a new
one. At this point the "weak brother" is tempted to give up trying, and take refuge in autistic
thinking, but the stronger individual accepts the challenge of reality. He sees that an invention
is not satisfactory unless it will really work, and sets about learning what will work and
what not, so accumulating observations that later enable him to criticize his own ideas, to
some extent, before trying them out on real things.

Criticism is directed upon the individual from the side of other people, who from the day he
first begins to tell his childish imaginings, are quite free with their objections. Humiliated
by this critical reception of his ideas, the individual may resolve to keep them to himself
for the future, and draw away, again, towards autistic thinking; or, more forcefully, he may
exert himself to find some idea that will command the approval of other people. If he can take
rebuffs goodnaturedly, he soon finds that social criticism can be a great help, that two heads
are better than one in planning any invention that needs to work. He accumulates knowledge
of what will pass muster when presented to other people, and thus again learns self-criticism.

Self-criticism is helped by such rules as to "think twice", to "sleep on it before deciding",
to "drop the matter for a time and come back to it and see whether it still looks {511} the
same". When you are all warmed up over an idea, its recency value gives it such an advantage
over opposing ideas that they have no chance, for the moment, of making themselves felt in
the line of criticism.

I once heard the great psychologist, and great writer, William James, make a remark that threw
some light on his mode of writing. In the evening, he said, after warming up to his subject,
he would write on and on till he had exhausted the lead he was following, and lay the paper
aside with the feeling, "Good! Good! That's good". The next morning, he said, it might not
seem good at all. This calls to mind the old advice to writers about its being "better to compose
with fury and correct with phlegm than to compose with phlegm and correct with fury". The phlegmatic
critical attitude interferes considerably with the enthusiastic inventive activity. Give invention
free rein for the time being, and come around with criticism later.

Some over-cautious and too self-critical persons, though rather fertile in ideas, never accomplish
much in the way of invention because they cannot let themselves go. Criticism is always at
their elbow, suggesting doubts and alternatives and preventing progress in the creative activity,
instead of biding its time and coming in to inspect the completed result. For a similar reason,
much of the best inventive work--writing, for example, or painting--is done in prolonged periods
of intense activity, which allow time for invention to get warmed to its task, when it takes
the bit in its teeth and dashes off at a furious speed, leaving criticism to trail along behind.

Invention in the service of art or of economic and social needs is controlled imagination,
realistic, socialized, subjected to criticism. It cannot afford to be autistic, but must meet
objective or social standards. Mechanical inventions must work when translated into matter-of-fact
wood and iron, and {512} must also pass the social test of being of some use. Social inventions
of the order of institutions, laws, political platforms and slogans, plans of campaign, must
"work" in the sense of bringing the desired response from the public. Social imagination of
the very important sort suggested by the proverbs, "Seeing ourselves as others see us", or
"Putting ourselves in the other fellow's place"--for it is only by imagination that we can
thus get outside of our own experience and assume another point of view--must check up with
the real sentiments of other people.

The Enjoyment of Imaginative Art

It requires imagination to enjoy art as well as to produce it. The producer of the work of
art puts the stimuli before you, but you must make the response yourself, and it is an inventive
response, not a mere repetition of some response you have often made. The novelist describes
a character for you, and you must respond by putting together the items in the description
so as to conceive of a character you have never met. The painter groups his figures before
you, but you must get the point of the picture for yourself. The musical composer provides
a series of chords, but you must get the "hang" of the passage for yourself, and if he has
introduced a novel effect, it may not be easy to find any beauty in it, at least on the first
hearing.

Art, from the consumer's side, is play. It is play of the imagination, with the materials conveniently
presented by the artist. Now, as art is intended to appeal to a consumer (or enjoyer), the
question as to sources of satisfaction in the enjoyment of art is fundamental in the whole
psychology of art, production as well as consumption.

We have the same questions to ask regarding the enjoyment of a novel as regarding a daydream.
Novel-reading is daydreaming with the materials provided by the {513} author, and gratifies
the same motives. A novel to be really popular must have a genuine hero or heroine--some one
with whom the reader can identify himself. The frequency of novels in which the hero or heroine
is a person of high rank, or wins rank or wealth in the course of the story, is a sign of appeal
to the mastery motive. The humble reader is tickled in his own self-esteem by identifying himself
for the time with the highborn or noble or beautiful character in the story. The escape motive
also is relied upon to furnish the excitement of the story, which always brings the hero into
danger or difficulty and finally rescues him, much to the reader's relief. Love stories appeal,
of course, to the sex impulse, humorous stories to laughter, and mystery stories to curiosity.
Cynical stories, showing the "pillars of society" in an ignoble light, appeal to the self-assertive
impulse of the reader, in that he is led to apply their teaching to pretentious people whom
he knows about, and set them down a peg, to his own relative advancement. But here again we
have to insist, as under the head of sports and daydreams, that interests of a more objective
kind are also gratified by a good work of fiction. A story that runs its logical course to
a tragic end is interesting as a good piece of workmanship, and as an insight into the world.
We cannot heartily identify ourselves with Hamlet or Othello, yet we should be sorry to have
those figures erased from our memories; they mean something, they epitomize world-facts that
compel our attention.

The appeal of art is partly emotional.

A very great work of art, the Apollo Belvedere or the Sistine Madonna, when you suddenly come
upon it in walking through a gallery, may move you almost or quite to tears. Beautiful music,
and not necessarily sad music either, has the same effect. Why this particular emotion should
be aroused is certainly an enigma. "Crying because you are so happy" is similar {514} but itself
rather inexplicable. In many other cases, the emotional appeal of art is easily analyzed. The
pathetic appeals straightforwardly to the grief impulse, the humorous to the laughter impulse,
the tragic to fear and escape. The sex motive is frequently utilized in painting and sculpture
as well as in literature.

Art makes also an intellectual appeal.

It is satisfying partly because of this appeal, as is clear when we remember that many great
works of art require mental effort in order to grasp and appreciate them. You must be wide-awake
to follow a play of Shakespeare; you must puzzle out the meaning of a group painting before
fully enjoying it; you must study some of the detail of a Gothic cathedral before getting the
full effect; music may be too "classical" for many to grasp and follow. Unless, then, the artist
has made a great mistake, the mental activity which he demands from his public must contribute
to the satisfaction they derive from his works. If his appeal were simply to their emotions,
any intellectual labor would be a disturbing element. The intellectual appeal is partly to
objective interests in the thing presented, partly to interest in the workmanship, and partly
to the mastery motive in the form of problem solution.

Perhaps we do not often think of a fine painting or piece of music as a problem set us for
solution, but it is that, and owes part of its appeal to its being a problem. To "get the hang
of" a work of art requires some effort and attention; if the problem presented is too difficult
for us, the work of art is dry; if too easy, it is tame.

The mastery motive is probably as important in the enjoyment of art as it is in play and dreaming.
It comes in once in the joy of mastering the significance of the work of art, and again in
self-identification with the fine characters portrayed.

{515}

Empathy in art enjoyment.

At first thought, some forms of art, as architecture, seem incapable of making the just-mentioned
double appeal to the mastery motive. Architecture can certainly present problems for the beholder
to solve, but how can the beholder possibly identify himself with a tower or arch? If, however,
we remember the "empathy" that we spoke of under the head of play, we see that the beholder
may project himself into the object, unintentionally of course, and thus perhaps get satisfaction
of his mastery impulse.

Look at a pillar, for example. If the pillar is too massive for the load supported, it gives
you the unsatisfactory impression of doing something absurdly small for your powers. If on
the contrary the pillar is too slender for the load that seems to rest upon it, you get the
feeling of strain and insecurity; but if it is rightly proportioned, you get the feeling of
a worthy task successfully accomplished. The pillar, according to empathy, pleases you by arousing
and gratifying your mastery impulse; and many other architectural effects can be interpreted
in the same way.

Empathy can perhaps explain the appeal of the big in art and nature. In spite of the warnings
put forth against thinking of mere bigness as great or fine, we must admit that size makes
a very strong appeal to something in human nature. The most perfect miniature model of a cathedral,
however interesting and attractive as it rests on the table before you, fails to make anything
like the impression that is made by the giant building towering above you. Big trees, lofty
cliffs, grand canyons, tremendous waterfalls, huge banks of clouds, the illimitable expanse
of the sea, demonstrate cogently the strong appeal of the big. Perhaps the big is not necessarily
grand, but the grand or sublime must be big or somehow suggest bigness. The question is, then,
what it is in us that responds to the appeal of the big.

{516}

Perhaps it is the submissive tendency that is aroused. This great mountain, so far outclassing
me that I am not tempted in the least to compete with it, affords me the joy of willing submission.
The escape motive may come in along with submissiveness--at the first sight of the mountain
a thrill of fear passes over me, but I soon realize that the mountain will not hurt me in spite
of its awe-inspiring vastness; so that my emotion is blended of the thrill of fear, the relief
of escape, and the humble joy of submission. That is one analysis of the esthetic effect of
bigness.

Empathy suggests a very different analysis. According to this, projecting myself into the mountain,
identifying myself with it, I experience the sensation of how it feels to be a mountain. It
feels big--I feel big. My mastery impulse is gratified. Light-colored. Thymine. Toy. ARTHUR, communicator

 This
might be called invention; it was breaking away from what had become routine, and that is the
essential fact about the inventive reaction. This playful spirit of cutting loose, manipulating,
and rearranging things to suit yourself is certainly a condition favorable to invention. It
does not guarantee a valuable invention, but it at least helps towards whatever invention the
individual's other qualifications make possible.

Another condition favorable to invention is youth. Seldom does a very old person get outside
the limits of his previous habits. Few great inventions, artistic or practical, have emanated
from really old persons, and comparatively few even from the middle-aged. On the other hand,
boys and girls under eighteen seldom produce anything of great value, not having as yet acquired
the necessary mastery of the materials with which they have to deal. The period from twenty
years up to forty seems to be the most favorable for inventiveness.

Imagination Considered in General

Finally, we must return to the question of definition or general description that was left
open near the beginning of the chapter. There seem to be two steps in the inventive response,
one preliminary, the other strictly inventive. The preliminary step brings the stimuli to bear,
and invention is the response that follows.

Typically, the preliminary stage consists in recall; and association by similarity, bringing
together materials from different past experiences, is very important as a preliminary to invention.
Facts recalled from different contexts are thus brought together, and invention consists in
a response to such novel combinations of facts. The two steps in invention are, first, getting
a combination of stimuli, and second, responding to the combination.

{520}

Sometimes it has been said that imagination consists in putting together material from different
sources, but this leaves the matter in mid-air; recall can bring together facts from different
sources and so afford the stimulus for an imaginative response, but the response goes beyond
the mere togetherness of the stimuli. Thinking of a man and also of a horse is not inventing
a centaur; there is a big jump from the juxtaposition of the data to the specific arrangement
that imagination gives them. The man plus the horse may give no response at all, or may give
many other responses besides that of a centaur; for example, a picture of the man and the horse
politely bowing to each other. The particular manipulation, or imaginative response, that is
made varies widely; sometimes it consists in taking things apart rather than putting them together,
as when you imagine how a house would look with the evergreen tree beside it cut down; always
it consists in putting the data into new relationships.

Imagination thus presents a close parallel to reasoning, where, also, there are two stages,
the preliminary consisting in getting the premises together and the final consisting in perceiving
the conclusion. The final response in imagination is in general like that in reasoning; both
are perceptive reactions; but imagination is freer and more variable. Reasoning is governed
by a very precise aim, to see the actual meaning of the combined premises; that is, it is exploratory;
while imagination, though it is usually more or less steered either by a definite aim or by
some bias in the direction of agreeable results, has after all much more latitude. It is seeking,
not a relationship that is there, but one that can be put there.

EXERCISES

1. Outline the chapter.

2. Make a list of hobbies and amusements that you specially enjoy,
   and try to discover the sources of satisfaction in each.

3. Recall two stories that you specially enjoyed, and try to
   discover the sources of satisfaction in each.

4. How far does the account of daydreams given in the text square
   with your own daydreams, and how far does it seem inadequate?

5. An experiment on the speed of revery or of daydreaming.
   Beginning at a recorded time, by your watch, let your mind wander
   freely for a few moments, stopping as soon as your stream of
   thoughts runs dry. Note the time at the close. Now review your
   daydream (or revery), and tally off the several scenes or
   happenings that you thought of, so as to count up and see how many
   distinct thoughts passed through your mind. How many seconds, on
   the average, were occupied by each successive item?

6. Why do dreams seem real at the time?

7. Analysis of a dream. Take some dream that you recall well, and let
   your thoughts play about it, and about the separate items of
   it--about each object, person, speech, and happening in the
   dream--with the object of seeing whether they remind you of
   anything personally significant. Push the analysis back to your
   childhood, by asking whether anything about the dream symbolizes
   your childish experiences or wishes. To be sure, the psychoanalyst
   would object that the individual cannot be trusted to make a
   complete analysis of his own dream--just as the psychologist would
   object to your accepting the recalled experiences and wishes as
   necessarily standing in any causal relation to your dream--but, at
   any rate, the exercise is interesting.

8. Problems in invention. Solve some of these, and compare the
   mental process with that of reasoning.

  (a) Devise a game to be played by children and adults together,
      to everybody's satisfaction.

  (b) Imagine a weird animal, after the analogy of the centaur.

  (c) Imagine an interesting incident, bringing in an old man,
      a little girl, and a waterfall.

  (d) Design the street plan for an ideal small town, built on
      both sides of a small river.

9. Show how empathy might make us prefer a symmetrical building to
   one that is lop-sided.

CHAPTER XX

WILL

PLANNED ACTION, ACTION IN SPITE OF INTERNAL CONFLICT, AND ACTION AGAINST EXTERNAL OBSTRUCTION

If the psychologist were required to begin his chapter on the will with a clean-cut definition,
he would be puzzled what to say. He might refer to the old division of the mind into the "three
great faculties" of intellect, feeling, and will, but would be in duty bound to add at once
that this "tripartite division" is now regarded as rather useless, if not misleading. It is
misleading if it leads us to associate will exclusively with motor action, for we also have
voluntary attention and voluntary control in reasoning and inventing, and we have involuntary
motor reactions. "Will" seems not to be any special kind of response, but rather to refer to
certain relationships in which a response may stand to other responses--but this is certainly
too vague a definition to be of use.

"Will" is not precisely a psychological term, anyway, but is a term of common speech which
need not refer to any psychological unit. In common speech it has various and conflicting meanings.
"Since you urge me", one may say, "I will do this, though much against my will." Let the dictionary
define such words. What psychology should do with them is simply to take them as a mining prospector
takes an outcropping of ore: as an indication that it may pay to dig in the neighborhood.

{524}

Voluntary and Involuntary Action

About the first thing we strike when we start digging is the distinction between voluntary
and involuntary. A man has committed homicide, and the question in court is whether he did
it "with malice aforethought", i.e., with full will and intention, whether he did it in a sudden
fit of anger, i.e., impulsively rather than quite voluntarily, or whether it was an accident
and so wholly unintentional or involuntary. The court wishes to know, since a man who has committed
one sort of homicide is a very different character from one who has committed another sort;
different acts can be expected from him in the future and different precautions need to be
taken accordingly.

It is a fact, then, that an act may be performed either with or without foreknowledge--a remarkable
fact both ways! An intentional act is remarkable from the side of physics or chemistry or botany--which
is to say that it is very exceptional in nature at large. On the other hand, a completely involuntary
act is rather exceptional in human behavior and perhaps in animal behavior as well, for almost
always there is some striving towards an end, some impulse. The simplest reflexes, to be sure,
are completely involuntary. The pupillary reaction to light is not done with malice aforethought,
cannot be so done. The lid reflex, or wink of the eye, occurs many times in the course of an
hour, without foreknowledge, or after-knowledge for that matter, though the same movement can
be made voluntarily. Sneezing and coughing are not voluntary in the full sense, but they are
distinctly impulsive, they strive towards desired relief. To sneeze voluntarily is to sneeze
when you don't want to, and to sneeze involuntarily is to sneeze when you want to--which seems
queer, since we usually think of a voluntary act as one done to further our wishes. No wonder that
it is also unable traits of itself with attester. We do not let it speak its usage; the truss, by baton,
the i-beam are keep of sight, connection is make of consoles and valance and Corinthian columns and balustrades,
and all traits of expressions. To reason is that nearly everything
that has been done with it have so far is not iron, stone. Achondrite
should be made of stone, and if have make of mashie, and relate they
are nothing but shams, and very humors.

Now architecture necessitate a effect is that we is compatible strength. We speak the forms speak

Fergusson,'which is not an good for mind, makeshift have attempted

in word what Gothic.

Details, if fairly, we would do much ancients might obscure to architecture.
 At least, this
is true of the simpler movements; compound movements, made up of familiar elements, may be
first observed in other persons and then voluntarily imitated. The child's process of acquiring
voluntary control over a movement is illustrated by the story of how the baby learned to put
his hand in his mouth. He first made this movement in the course of "aimless" throwing of his
arms about, liked the sensation of the hand in the mouth, tried apparently to get it there
again, and in the course of a few days was able to put it there at will. The child's "aimless"
movements at the start were probably impulsive, but they were not directed towards any preconceived
end. Then, having observed a desirable result of one movement, he worked towards that result
by trial and error, till finally he had the necessary movement so closely linked to the thought
of the result as to follow directly upon the thought.

Once brought under voluntary control, a movement becomes with further repetition habitual and
mechanical, and no longer voluntary or even impulsive. Thus the voluntary {527} performance
of an act intervenes between the native or instinctive doing of it and the later habitual doing
of it. Blowing out a match affords another example of this course of events. A child can of
course blow out, instinctively, when he has the natural stimulus for strong expiration, but
he cannot at will blow at the lighted match. Being prompted and shown, he comes by degrees
to be able to blow out the match; during the learning stage he has to try, and the act is voluntary;
but with further practice it becomes involuntary, though it may still be executed as part of
a larger voluntary act, such as preventing a burning match from setting fire to something on
which it has fallen.

A complex act, or series of movements, may be voluntary as a whole, being directed towards
some preconceived result, while the single movements that constitute the series are mechanical,
their particular results no longer being thought of separately. This is well illustrated by
the instances of typewriting, speaking, and signing the name, mentioned a moment ago. With
practice, the interest in a performance goes more and more to the final result and deserts
the elements of the act.

It is during the organization of reactions that they require attention and must be thought
of before being executed. Organization goes on and on, a thoroughly organized reaction being
later combined with others into a still bigger act. New demands constantly made upon the individual
prevent him, however well organized, from ever reaching the condition of a wholly automatic
machine. Will, in the sense of action aimed at the accomplishment of foreseen results, stays
with him to the end.

Ideomotor Action

Involuntary movement is not always "sensorimotor", which means directly aroused by a sensory
stimulus; oftener {528} it is "ideomotor", or directly aroused by an idea or thought. It may
be so aroused and still be involuntary. We think of a certain result and our muscles produce
this result, though we did not really mean to do this act ourselves. The thought arouses the
movement because it has previously been linked with the movement. A thought which has previously
served as the stimulus to an act will tend to have this effect again, unless inhibited by some
contrary stimulus. There is no need of a definite consent to the act, provided there is nothing
present to inhibit it.

Good examples of ideomotor action can be observed among the audience at an athletic contest.
You are watching one of your team do the pole vault, for instance, and are so much absorbed
in his performance and so desirous for him to succeed that you identify yourself with him to
a degree. He is rising to clear the high bar, and the thought of his clearing it, monopolizing
your mind and leaving no room for the inhibitory thought that the performer is down there in
the field and you up here in the stand, causes you to make an incipient leg movement as if
you yourself were vaulting.

Voluntary action, in the fullest sense, occurs when you realize the situation and are definitely
conscious of yourself, that is to say, when you differentiate yourself clearly out of the total
situation, and not only imagine some change to be made, but think of that change as to be produced
by you, without at the same time having any contrary thought to inhibit actual execution.

Conflict and Decision

It appears that in our "digging" we have now struck another vein, for here we have the fact
of one tendency running contrary to another and inhibiting it. Conflict of desires and the
consequent necessity of choosing between {529} them, is thus brought vividly to our attention.
Every one would at once agree that "will" and "choice" belong closely together. The most distinctly
voluntary acts occur when two alternatives are thought of, and one of them is chosen.

Organized as we are by nature, that is to say, on a large scale, but incompletely--environed
as we are, with multitudinous stimuli constantly playing on us and arousing contrary tendencies--we
cannot hope to escape conflict of motives and the necessity of making decisions. Every decision
made, every conflict resolved, is a step in the further organization of the individual. It
may be a step in a good direction, or in a bad direction, but it is a step in organizing the
individual's reaction-tendencies into what we call his character--the more or less organized
sum total of his native and acquired tendencies to reaction, with emphasis on those reactions
that affect his life and social relations in a broad way.

The lowest animals, having few reaction tendencies, and being responsive to only a narrow environment,
show little sign of internal conflict, and when it does occur it is resolved very simply by
the advantage going to one of the opposing tendencies, with perhaps a shift later to the other,
in the way described in our earlier consideration of attention. [Footnote: See p. 251.] This
type of decision is fundamental. In the behavior of higher animals, we sometimes detect signs
of a longer-persisting conflict, as between curiosity and fear, when a wild creature seems
poised between his inclination to approach and examine a strange object and his inclination
to run away, veering now towards the one and now towards the other alternative, and unable,
as it seems, to reach a decision.

Conflict between the enterprising tendency to explore, manipulate or somehow launch forth into
the new, and the negative tendencies of fear, inertia, shyness, etc., is {530} something that
recurs again and again in human experience, as illustrated by making up your mind to get up
in the morning, or to plunge into the cold water, or to speak up and have your say in a general
conversation. There is a hesitancy in such cases, due to a positive and a negative tendency.
The conflict may be resolved in favor of the negative tendency by simple prolongation of the
hesitation till the occasion for action has passed, or it may be resolved in favor of the positive
tendency when this is strong enough for an instant to enable the individual to commit himself
to the enterprise, after which he usually stays committed. The positive motive must for an
instant be stronger than the negative, in order to get action.

A somewhat different type of conflict, which may be called vacillation, occurs when two positive
tendencies are aroused that are inconsistent with each other, so that gratification of the
one entails renunciation of the other. Old Buridan's celebrated problem of the ass, placed
equally distant from two equally attractive bundles of hay, and whether he would starve to
death from the exact balance of the two opposing tendencies, is a sort of parable to fit this
case. Probably the poor ass did not starve--unless he richly deserved his name--but he may
conceivably have ended the very uncomfortable state of vacillation by running away altogether,
as a human being, who is really more subject to vacillation than any other creature, is sometimes
so much disturbed at having to decide between two invitations for the same day as to decline
both, and go fishing. Vacillation is certainly a very unpleasant state of mind. We want action,
or else we want peace, but vacillation gives us neither. In spite of its irksomeness, we seem
sometimes almost powerless to end it, because as soon as we have about decided on the one alternative,
what we shall miss by not choosing the other comes vividly to mind, and swings the pendulum
its way.

{531}

However it comes about that a decision is reached, it usually is reached, and the curious fact
then is that it usually sticks. A student may vacillate long between the apparently equal attractions
of two colleges, but when he finally decides on one, the advantages of the other lose their
hold on him. Now he is all for one and not at all for the other. Having identified himself
with one college, he has completely altered the balance of attractions, his self-assertion
now going wholly on the side of the chosen college, and even leading him to pick flaws in the
other as if to reinforce his decision. In other words, he "rationalizes", justifies, and fortifies
his decision, once he has reached it. Some people, indeed, are abnormally subject to vacillation
and seem never to accept their own decisions as final, but normally there are strong influences
tending to maintain a decision, once it is made: the unpleasantness of the state of vacillation
and relief at having escaped from it; the satisfaction of having a definite course of action;
and self-assertion, because we have decided, and now this course of action is ours. During
vacillation, neither of the alternatives was identified with ourselves, but now we have decided
and are not going to be so weak as to change. X is our college now and anything you say against
it you say against us. Thus the person who has decided defends himself energetically against
reopening the question.

The state of indecision and the state of decision seem thus fairly well understood, but the
process of passing from the one to the other is often obscure. It differs from one case to
another. In one case we find the rational process of deliberation, in which each alternative
is weighed and the decision awarded to the one that promises best. This is essentially a work
of imagination: you imagine that you have adopted the one alternative, and see how it suits
you, then you do the same with the other alternative. You think each {532} alternative through
to see how satisfactory it will be, balance one against the other, and choose accordingly.
This is ideal, but often impracticable, since we have not the time for full deliberation, or
since we cannot trust imagination to give us a correct picture, or since we have no common
measure by aid of which to balance off different sorts of satisfaction. Even when practicable,
the deliberate way of reaching a decision is likely to seem irksome, because of the delay involved
and the natural propensity for impulsive action. Perhaps the most common process is a sort
of partial deliberation, the two alternatives appealing to us by turns till at some moment
one makes a strong enough appeal to secure action.

Sometimes there is a deadlock, and then we either give up deciding for the moment, and, sleeping
over the matter, find when we next take it up that one alternative has lost its momentary attractiveness
and the other has the field; or else, feeling the irksomeness and humiliation, almost, of being
unable to make up our mind, we say, "Any decision is better than none; here goes, then; this
is what I will do", so breaking the deadlock by what seems like an arbitrary toss-up.

At other times, without such a distinct "act of will", and without any observable change in
the attractiveness of either alternative, we simply find, after awhile, that a decision has
emerged, and that we now know what we are going to do. What has happened in us to bring about
the decision we cannot see, but here we are with a decision made and perhaps with the act already
performed. The two alternatives remain theoretically equal, but one has somehow got hold of
us, while the other has lapsed.

Then there is the case where we "see the better, but follow the worse", or are in great danger
of so doing. The "worse" is usually something that appeals to the {533} "old Adam" in us, something
that strongly arouses a primitive instinctive response; while the "better" is a nobler, more
dutiful, or more prudent course. The lower motive being the stronger, how can it ever be that
the higher motive gets the decision? Well, the fight is not just a contest between these two.
Other motives are drawn into the fray, the whole man is drawn in, and it is a question which
side is the stronger. Fear of ridicule or criticism, sense of duty, self-respect, ambition,
ideals of oneself, concern for the welfare of another person, loyalty to a social group, may
be ranged on the side of the "weaker" motive and give it the advantage over the stronger.

What becomes of the rejected motives? If unimportant and s superficial, they simply lapse into
an inactive state and are gradually forgotten, perhaps recurring to mind once in a while with
a faint tinge of regret, since after all we should have liked to gratify them. "As a boy, I
wanted to be a sailor; well, I would rather like to try it for once." When a motive is deeply
rooted in our nature, it cannot be so easily eliminated. Sometimes it is simply deferred and
remains dormant, content to bide its time; "there will be time enough for that later on". Sometimes
it is disguised and then gratified, as when an apparently courteous deed contains an element
of spite. Sometimes it is afforded a substitute gratification, as when the boastful boy, after
having his "conceit taken out of him" by his mates, boasts of his school, profession, town
or country. This is often called "sublimation". Sometimes, though denied, it remains insistent,
and "defense mechanisms" have to be devised to keep it down; the "sour grapes" mechanism is
an example, which may be used not only when the "grapes" are physically out of reach but also
when for any reason we decide to leave them alone.

 The "will", in common usage, will not
brook resistance--the "indomitable will".

Now effort and determination, in our chapter on the native impulses, were put under the head
of the assertive or masterful tendency; and it does seem that "will", in this sense, is almost
the same thing as the instinct of self-assertion. Certainly, in the case of adults, an obstruction
puts the individual "on his mettle", and superimposes the mastery motive upon whatever motive
it may have been that originally prompted the action.

The mastery motive came clearly to light in an experiment designed to investigate "will action".
The subject of the experiment was first given a long course of training in responding to certain
stimulus words by other certain words that were constantly paired with them; and when his habits
of response were thus well fixed, his task was changed so that now he must respond to any word
or syllable by any {537} other that rhymed with it. A series of stimuli now began with words
for which no specific response habit had been formed, and to these the subject reacted with
no great difficulty. But then, unexpectedly, he got a stimulus word to which he had a fixed
habit of response, and before he could catch himself he had made the habitual response, and
so failed to give a rhyme as he had intended. This check sometimes made him really angry, and
at least it brought him up to attention with a feeling which he expressed in the words, "I
can and will do this thing". He was thus put on his guard, gave closer attention to what he
was doing, and was usually able to overcome the counter tendency of habit and do what he meant
to do. Some subjects, who adapted themselves readily and fully to the rhyming task, i.e., who
got up a good "mental set" for this sort of reaction, made few errors and did not experience
this feeling of effort and determination; for them the effort was unnecessary; but the average
person needed the extra energy in order to overcome the resistances and accomplish his intentions.

Other good instances of effort are found in the overcoming of distraction, described under
the head of attention, [Footnote: See p. 259.] and in the work of the beginner at any job.
When the beginner has passed the first cautious, exploratory stage of learning, he begins to
"put on steam". He pounds the typewriter, if that is what he is learning, spells the words
aloud, and in other ways betrays the great effort he is making.

Ask a child just learning to write why he grasps the pencil so tightly, why he bends so closely
over the desk, why he purses his lips, knits his brow, and twists his foot around the leg of
his chair, and he might answer, very truly, that it is because he cannot do this job easily
and has to try hard. All these unnecessary muscular movements and tensions {538} show the access
of energy that has been liberated in his brain by the obstruction encountered.

Any learner, once he has mastered the difficulties of the task, reaches an easy-running stage
in which effort is no longer required, unless for making a record or in some way surpassing
himself. With reference to effort, then, we may speak of three stages of practice: the initial,
exploratory stage, the awkward and effortful stage, and the skilled and free-running stage.
These are identical with the three stages in the development of attention to a subject, which
were described [Footnote: See p.258] as the stage of spontaneous attention or curiosity; the
stage of forced attention, or effortful attention, controlled by such motives as fear or self-assertion;
and the final stage of objective interest and absorption in the subject, which is evidently
the same as the free-running condition.

Effort is not a good in itself; it is an unpleasant condition; but it is a natural response
to difficulty and is often necessary in order to get the individual into the free-running condition
which is both efficient and pleasant. It is often required to get the individual out of the
easy-going condition into the free-running condition, which is something entirely different.
In free-running action there may be even more energy expended than in effortful action, but
it is better directed and produces no strains and jolts.

Intelligence, in the sense of adaptability and "seeing the point", may often take the place
of effort. Consider the way two different people react to a sticking door: the one puts in
more strength and forces it, the other by a deft thrust to the side opens it without much extra
force. You can't say absolutely which mode of attack is better, for your stubborn one may waste
his strength on an obstruction that really cannot be forced, while your clever one may waste
his {539} time on a door that needs only a bit of a push. Persistence plus adaptability is
what efficient activity demands.

Thought and Action

"Men of thought" and "men of action" are sometimes contrasted--which is hardly fair to either,
since the great man of action must have the imagination to conceive a plan, and must know exactly
what he is aiming to accomplish, while the great thinker must be persistent in thinking and
must get into action by way of writing or somehow making his thoughts count in the world. But
we do find men who are impatient of thought and want to get into action at once, even without
knowing just what they are about, and other men who seem quite contented to think and plan,
without any definite intention of ever putting their plans into execution. The former type,
the impulsive individual, is not difficult to understand, his behavior fits in so well with
the primitive trial-and-error sort of activity; but the mere thinker seems an anomaly, in view
of the general psychological principle that thought tends toward motor action.

In accounting for the inactive thinker, we have to remember, first, that some inhibition of
immediate action is often necessary, in order to have time to think the matter over; this prudent
attitude becomes a habit with some individuals. Besides, there are the negative motives of
fear, shyness and laziness that tend to deter from the actual execution of a plan. {540} Fear--fear
of unforeseen consequences, fear of committing ourselves, fear of ridicule--is one great inhibiter
of action, and inertia is another, since it is much less strenuous to sit in the armchair and
plan than to get out and put the plan into effect. Besides this, some people who are good at
planning come to take so much pride and satisfaction in the thinking part of an enterprise
that they do not feel the need for action. Moreover, you can "plan" in a large way, without
bothering about details, but once you start to execute your plan you encounter details and
preliminaries which are apt to rob the enterprise of its zest. Here is where persistence and
effort are needed.

Abulia--"no will"--is an abnormal degree of lack of zest for action. Along with it go timidity
and lack of social force, proneness to rumination and daydreaming, and often a feeling of being
compelled to perform useless acts, such as doing everything three times or continual washing
of the hands. Abulia is not just a comfortable laziness, but is attended by a sense of humiliation
and inferiority. It shows itself in excessive hesitation and vacillation and in failure to
accomplish anything of consequence. Sometimes the subject expends much effort, but fails to
direct the effort towards the execution of his purposes. Some authorities have ascribed abulia
to inertia or "low mental tension", some to an overdose of fear and caution, some to the paralyzing
effect of suppressed desires still living in the "unconscious". Mild degrees of it, such as
are not uncommon, seem sometimes to be due to the hiatus that is bound to exist between the
end one has in view and the means one must take to start towards that end. One has zest for
reaching the goal, but not for the preliminaries.

An author, whose case was studied because he was accomplishing so little, was found to follow
a daily program about as follows. He would get up in the morning full of {541} confidence that
this was going to be a good day, with much progress made in his book. Before starting to write,
however, he must first have his breakfast, and then a little fresh air, just to prepare himself
for energetic work. On returning from his walk, he thought it best to rest for a few moments,
and then one or two other little matters seemed to demand attention; by the time these were
done, the morning was so far gone that there was no time for a really good effort, so he optimistically
postponed the writing till the afternoon, when the same sort of thing happened, and the great
performance had to be put over till the next day. This man did better under a regime prescribed
by his medical adviser, who commanded him to write for two hours immediately after rising,
and make this his day's work--no more and no less than two hours. The definiteness of this
task prevented dawdling.

Other writers have noted a curious tendency to "fight shy" of the passage actually being written
and let the thoughts move ahead and plan out the later passages. Sometimes it is necessary
to trick yourself if you are to get anything done; you say, "I can't write this properly just
now; I'll just sketch out a preliminary draft"--on which understanding you may be able to write,
whereas you could not if you thought you were writing "for keeps"; but when you have got well
started and warmed to the task, you may find your work good enough to keep, after all. Judging
by these mild cases, abulia may be due partly to distaste for the details of actual performance,
and partly to a dread of committing oneself to anything that has the stamp of finality.

Securing Action

No chapter in psychology offers more in the way of practical applications than this chapter
on the will--if we only {542} knew more on the subject! How to get action, either from yourself,
or from others if you are responsible for their action, is a big practical problem. A few hints
on the matter are suggested by what precedes.

How to get action from yourself--how to liberate your latent energies and accomplish what you
are capable of accomplishing. A definite purpose is the first requirement; without that one
merely drifts, with no persistency and no great energy. The goal should be something that appeals
vitally to you, and something which you can attain; not too distant a goal; or, if the ultimate
goal is distant, there must be mileposts along the way which you can take as more immediate
goals; for a goal that can be reached by immediate action enlists more present effort. The
student puts more energy into his study when the examination is close at hand; and, although
this is regrettable, it reveals a fact in human nature that can be utilized in the management
of yourself or others. A well defined and clearly visible goal is a much better energy-releaser
than vague "good intentions".

The more clearly you can see and measure your approach towards the goal, the more action; thus
it has been found in many different lines that the "practice curve method" of training gives
quicker and better results than ordinary drill. In the practice curve [Footnote: See p. 321.]
you have a picture of your progress; you are encouraged by seeing how far you have advanced,
and stimulated to surpass your past record, and thus your immediate goal is made very definite.
You cannot do so well when you simply "do your best" as when you set out to reach a certain
level, high enough to tax your powers without being quite out of reach. Me say him understand!

 He can be driven to a certain
extent by fear and economic want; but better results, and the best social condition generally,
can be expected from such management as enlists the individual's own will. He must be made
to feel that the enterprise is his, after all. He must feel that he is fairly treated, and
that he receives a just share of the proceeds. He must be interested in the purposes of the
concern and in the operations on which he is engaged. Best of all, perhaps, some responsibility
and initiative must be delegated to him. When the master, not contented with setting the main
goal, insists on bossing every detail, continually interfering in the servant's work, the servant
has the least possible chance of adopting the job as his own. But where the master is able,
in the first place, to show the servant the objective need and value of the goal, and to leave
the initiative in respect to ways and means to the servant, looking to him for results, the
servant often responds by throwing himself into the enterprise as if it were his own--as, indeed,
it properly is in such a case.

"Initiative"--that high-grade trait that is so much in demand--seems to be partly a matter
of imagination and partly of will. It demands inventiveness in seeing what can be done, zest
for action, and an independent and masterful spirit.

The physician who treats "nervous" or neurotic cases has this problem of getting action from
his patients. Strange as it may seem, these cases, while bemoaning their unfortunate condition,
cling to it as if it had its compensations, and do not wholeheartedly will to get well. They
have {546} slumped into the attitude of invalidism, and need reorientation towards the goal
of health and accomplishment. How to bring this about is the great problem. Much depends here
on the personality of the physician, and different physicians (as well as mental healers outside
the medical profession) employ different technique with more or less of success. The first
necessity is to win the patient's confidence; after that, some use persuasion, some suggestion,
some psychoanalysis, some (non-medical practitioners) use metaphysical doctrines designed to
lead the patient to "hitch his wagon to a star". On the intellectual side, these methods agree
in giving the patient a new perspective, in which weakness, ill health and maladaptation are
seen to be small, insignificant and unnecessary, and health and achievement desirable and according
to the nature of things; while on the side of impulse they probably come together in appealing
to the masterful and self-assertive tendency, either by putting the subject on his mettle,
or by leading him to partake of the determined, masterful attitude of the physician, or by
making him feel that he is one with the great forces of the universe. Methods that psychologically
are very similar to these are employed by the clergyman in dealing with morally flabby or maladjusted
individuals; and the courts are beginning to approach the delinquent from the same angle. All
the facts seem to indicate that the way to get action is to have a goal that "fires the imagination"
and enlists the masterful tendencies of human nature.

The Influence of Suggestion

Can the will of one person be controlled by that of another, through hypnotism or any similar
practice? This question is often asked anxiously by those who fear that crime or misconduct
willed by one person may be passively executed by another.

{547}

Hypnosis is a sleeplike and passive state that is nevertheless attentive and concentrated.
It appears as if the subject were awake at just one point, namely at the point of relation
with the hypnotizer. To stimuli from other sources, external or internal, he is inaccessible.
His field of activity is narrowed down to a point, though at that point he may be intensely active.

The depth of the hypnotic state varies from shallow to profound. Comparatively few individuals
can be deeply hypnotized, but many can be got into a mild receptive state, in which they accept
the suggestions of the hypnotizer more readily than in the fully awaking state. The waking
person is alert, suspicious, assertive, while the hypnotized subject is passive and submissive.
The subject's coöperation is necessary, in general, in order to bring on the hypnotic state,
whether shallow or deep.

The means of inducing hypnosis are many and varied, but they all consist in shoving aside extraneous
thoughts and stimuli, and getting the subject into a quiet, receptive attitude, with attention
sharply focussed upon the operator.

When the subject is in this state, the "suggestions" of the operator are accepted with less
criticism and resistance than in the fully waking state. In deep hypnosis, gross illusions
and even hallucinations can be produced. The operator hands the subject a bottle of ammonia,
with the assurance that it is the perfume of roses, and the subject smells of it with every
appearance of enjoyment. The operator points to what he says is a statue of Apollo in the corner,
and the subject apparently sees one there.

Loss of sensation can also be suggested and accepted. Being assured that his hand has lost
its sensation and cannot feel a pin prick, the subject allows his hand to be pricked with no
sign of pain. Paralysis of the arm or leg can be similarly suggested and accepted.

{548}

Acts may be suggested and performed. The subject is handed a cardboard sword with the assurance
that that is a sword, and directed to attack some person present, which he does with the appearance
of serious intent.

Now, however, let the subject be given a real sword with the same command as before. Result--the
subject wakes up! This suggestion was too much; it aroused dormant tendencies, broadened out
the field of activity, and so produced the waking condition. A suggestion that runs counter
to the subject's organized character and tendencies cannot get by without arousing them and
so awakening the subject. Consequently, there does not seem to be much real danger of crimes
being performed by innocent persons under hypnosis.

In mild hypnosis, the above striking phenomena are not produced, but suggestions of curative
value may be conveyed, and so taken to heart that they produce real results. The drowsy state
of a child just falling to sleep can be similarly utilized for implanting suggestions of value.
One little boy had a nervous twitching of the face that was very annoying. His father, just
as the child was dropping off to sleep, conveyed the suggestion that the child didn't like
this twitching; and this suggestion, repeated night after night, in a few days caused the twitching
almost wholly to disappear.

Suggestion often succeeds in a waking state. In a certain test for "suggestibility", the task
is set of copying a series of lines. The first line is short, the second longer, the third
longer still, the rest all of the same length, but the more suggestible individual keeps on
making each succeeding line longer. There are, however, various tests for suggestibility, and
an individual who succumbs to one does not necessarily succumb to another, so that it may be
doubted whether we should baldly speak of one individual as more suggestible than another.

{549}

Suggestion may be exerted by a person, or by the circumstances. If by a person, the more "prestige"
he enjoys in the estimation of the subject, the greater his power of suggestion. A prestige
person is one to whom you are submissive. A child is so dependent on older people, and so much
accustomed to "being told", that he is specially susceptible to prestige suggestion.

Suggestion exerted by the circumstances is about the same as what is often called "auto-suggestion"
or "self-suggestion". A man falls and hurts his hip, and, finding his leg difficult to move,
conceives that it is paralyzed, and may continue paralyzed for some time.

"Counter-suggestion" applies to cases where a suggestion produces the result contrary to what
is suggested. You suggest to a person that he should do a certain thing, and immediately he
is set against that act, though, left to himself, he would have performed it. Or, you advance
a certain opinion and at once your hearer takes the other side of the question. Quite often
skilful counter-suggestion can secure action, from children or adults, which could not be had
by positive suggestion or direct command.

If suggestion succeeds by arousing the submissive tendency, counter-suggestion succeeds by
arousing the assertive tendency. Suggestion works when it gets response without awakening the
resistance which might be expected, and counter-suggestion when it arouses so much resistance
that the suggestion itself does not have the influence which might be expected. In terms of
stimulus and response, suggestion works when a particular stimulus (what is suggested) arouses
response without other stimuli being able to contribute to the response; and counter-suggestion
works when a stimulus (what is suggested, again) is itself prevented from contributing to the
response. In counter-suggestion, response to the suggestion itself is inhibited, and in positive
{550} suggestion response to other stimuli is inhibited. Both involve narrowness of response,
and are opposed to what we commonly speak of as "good judgment", the taking of all relevant
stimuli into account, and letting the response be aroused by the combination.

CHAPTER XXI

PERSONALITY

THE INDIVIDUAL AS A WHOLE, INTEGRATED OR PARTIALLY DISSOCIATED

People differ not only in intelligence and efficiency, but in an intangible something referred
to as "personality". If your acquaintance is applying for a certain position, and has named
you as one of his references, you will be asked by the appointing officer to tell what you
know of the candidate's experience, his knowledge and skill in the field where he desires a
position, his character and habits, and his personality; and in replying you state, if you
conscientiously can, that the candidate has a pleasing and forceful personality, that he gets
on well with superiors, equals and inferiors, is coöperative, energetic, ambitious without
being selfish, clean, modest, brave, self-reliant, cheerful, optimistic, equal-tempered; and
you perhaps include here traits that might also be classed under the head of "character", as
honesty, truthfulness, industry, reliability, and traits that might be classed under physique,
as good appearance and carriage, commanding presence, a "strong face", and even neatness and
good taste in dress. Here we have an array of traits that are of great importance to the individual's
success in his work, in his social relationships and in his family life; and it is a proof
of how much remains to be accomplished in psychology that we cannot as yet present anything
like a real scientific analysis of personality, nor show on what elementary factors it depends.

{553}

Factors in Personality

If we do attempt some sort of analysis, we have first to notice that personality depends in
part on physique. In ordinary life, mental and physical traits are not sharply distinguished,
and probably they cannot be distinguished except in the abstract. The mere size of a person
affects his attitude towards other people and their attitude towards him--and it is in such
social relations that personality most clearly stands out. His size affects the individual's
behavior in subtle ways, since the big fellow dominates others easily just by virtue of his
size, and so tends to be good-humored, while the little fellow is apt to be strenuous and self-assertive.
Muscular development and "looks" also have their effect on personality.

Another factor might, by a sort of play on words, be called chemique. This corresponds to what
is often called temperament, a very obscure matter psychologically. Ou, it was Miss, as ye ken weel
who said, Keyboard. Case; they were walking wi'the Hazlewood upon what had these ice.''and what
did you tell that him was about how them?'it demanded his Glossin.'ou,
was sic points about folk because was playing into bit, and of Stevenson
that was at cock, and leddies, and was just like.''which have ladies?
and what did he ask about it made, Action?'busied the motive.'what
leddies?



This particular chemical derivation of temperament is, of course, out of date, being based
on very imperfect knowledge of physiology; but it still remains possible that chemical substances
carried around in the body fluids have much to do with the sort of trait that we think of under
{554} the head of temperament. Only that to-day, with some knowledge regarding the internal
secretions of the "endocrine glands", we should be inclined to connect temperament with them,
rather than with blood, bile, etc. Take, for example, the secretion of the adrenal glands,
that we found to be poured out during fear and anger and to have so much to do with the bodily
condition of readiness for violent action and probably also with the "stirred-up" emotional
state. What is more likely than that individuals differ in the strength of their adrenal secretion
or in the readiness with which the glands are aroused to pour it out into the circulation?
The excitable individual might be one with over-active adrenals. And in the same way the strenuous
individual might be one with an unusually active thyroid gland, since there certainly seems
to be some connection between this gland and the tendency to great activity. There are several
other glands that possibly affect behavior in somewhat similar ways, so that it is not improbable,
though still rather hypothetical, that chemical substances, produced in these glands, and carried
by the blood to the brain and muscles, have much to do with the elusive traits that we class
under temperament and personality.

Once more, consider the instincts in relation to personality. Undoubtedly these instinctive
tendencies differ in strength in different individuals. One is more gregarious than another,
and this is an important element in his personality. One is more assertive and masterful than
another, one is more "motherly" than another, more responsive by tender and protective behavior
to the presence of children or others who need help. One is more prone to laugh than another,
and the "sense of humor" is admitted to be an important element in personality. And so on through
the list; so that personality can be partially analyzed in terms of instinct.

Has intelligence anything to do with personality? It certainly has, in many ways. One who is
slow in learning adapts himself poorly to other persons and remains out of touch with his social
environment. "Tact" depends partly on instinctive liking for society, no doubt, but partly
on the ability to perceive what others want, and on the imagination to put yourself in their
place. High principles require the ability to reason things out and see them in perspective.
Statistical studies of the rulers of Europe, for a period of several centuries, show that on
the whole those with higher intelligence were also of better character and personality. Criminals,
taken as a whole, average rather low in intelligence; and it may even be doubted whether the
clever, scheming rascal, who defrauds widows of their money, or trains feeble-minded boys to
pick pockets for him, has, after all, the brains of the man who can easily see how such schemes
could be worked but decides against them himself because he sees something better worth doing.

A sense of inferiority, either physical or mental, is apt to affect the personality unfavorably.
It does not necessarily produce humble behavior; far from that, it often leads to a nervous
assertiveness. An apparently disdainful individual is often really shy and unsure of himself.
Put a man where he can see he is equal to his job and at the same time is accomplishing something
worth while, and you often see considerable improvement in his personality. 

Nay, that it has done the is the; it has granted forty acts may accomplish

In these Washington, can even, the Chancery in England, considering

Ask any one to tell you what he knows about himself, and he will begin to tell you how he differs
from others. Thus the individual's conception of himself is largely a product of his social
experience.

The self is first known as wish or will, and probably that always remains the core of any one's
conception of himself. That is to say, I think of myself first of all as wishing, aiming, purposing,
resisting, striving, competing. But I may come to know myself more objectively. By dint of
experience I know something of my limitations. I know I am not muscular enough to do this,
nor mathematical enough to do that, nor artistic enough to do the other. In this progressive
age, some children even know their own IQ. We {557} have frequent occasion to measure ourselves
against others, or against tasks, and lay some of the lessons to heart. Though most of us are
probably inclined to overrate ourselves, many will be found to give a pretty exact estimate
of themselves. It is surprising that this should be so, in view of the tendency to believe
what one wishes, and of the deep-seated desire for superiority or at least against inferiority.
It shows that, after all, there is a good deal of fidelity to fact in our make-up.

The word "self-assertion", which has been used more or less throughout the book as a name for
the native tendency to resist, persist, master, dominate, display oneself and seek social recognition,
can now be seen to be not entirely a good word for the purpose. It seems to imply that the
self-assertive individual is necessarily conscious of the self. From what has just been said,
it can be seen that this would be putting the cart before the horse. The self-assertive impulse
precedes, consciousness of self follows and depends on self-assertion. A true estimate of oneself
and one's limitations arises from self-assertion plus experience of failure and the necessity
of giving up and submitting.

Self-assertion is not identical with selfishness. Selfishness aims to get, self-assertion to
do. Selfish behavior is, however, often dictated by self-assertion, as when a person wishes
to get and have, in order to be able to show by his possessions what a great man he is. But
sometimes self-assertion squelches selfishness, leading a person to renounce present gain without
hope of later gain in compensation, just because he sees in such renunciation the best chance
for mastery and proving himself "the captain of his soul".

The "expansion of the self" is an interesting and significant phenomenon. The individual comes
to call things, persons, social groups, ideas and principles by the name {558} "mine". Now
what is mine is part of me. My self-feeling attaches to my dog; I am proud of that dog, brag
of his exploits, am cast down if I see him outclassed; and it is the same way with my house,
my son, my town, my country. We spoke of this sort of thing before, under the name of "sublimation
of the self-assertive impulse", and we said then that the sublimation was made possible by
the combination of this impulse with some other interest. My dog is not entirely myself; he
is a dog, and I am interested in him as a dog; I am interested in other dogs, and like to watch
their antics. But this particular dog means more than another to me because he is mine; I have
expanded myself to include him. In general, the self is expanded to take in objects that are
interesting in themselves, but which become doubly interesting by being appropriated and identified
in some measure with oneself.

Integration and Disintegration of the Personality

Though the individual is always in one sense a unit, there is a sense in which he needs to
achieve unity. His various native tendencies and interests do not always pull together, and
in fact some necessarily pull against others. So that we sometimes say of a person that he
is behaving so differently from usual that we should not know he was the same person. We may
speak of one person as being well integrated, meaning that he is always himself, his various
tendencies being so coördinated as to work reasonably well together; whereas of another we
speak as poorly integrated, unstable, an uncertain quantity. Integration is achieved partly
by selection from among conflicting impulses, partly by coördination, partly by judicious treatment
of those impulses that are denied; as was partly explained in the last chapter. 

The feature of our city as boardinghouse is that little strip of his garden
in an business, has merely within the pavement. The dope of the patio
at the terminal of the Promenade as elaborate as the interests of
a church, but they are all American-- all our own.

For this, has excessively, we may well believe we have some assertion man. At least it is not European,
for one in Who, Who, etc., some of most palatial accommodation are without another as a pavement--
the artifact instincts make himself from paries to partition.
 "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" gives an extreme picture of such lack of
integration, a picture rather fanciful than drawn from real life.
