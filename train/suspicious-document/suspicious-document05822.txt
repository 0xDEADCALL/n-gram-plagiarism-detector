"I saw you, Mr. Twentyman, and I wanted just to have a word with you."

"You are the biggest rascal in all Rufford," said Larry. "I wonder the lads have left you with
a whole bone in your skin."

"What have I done worse than any other poor man, Mr. Twentyman? When I took them herrings I
didn't know there was p'ison; and if I hadn't took 'em, another would. I am going to cut it
out of this, Mr. Twentyman."

"May the -- go along with you!" said Larry, wishing his neighbour a very unpleasant companion.

"And of course I must sell the place. Think what it would be to you! I shouldn't like it to
go into his Lordship's hands. It's all through Bean I know, but his Lordship has had a down
on me ever since he came to the property. It's as true as true about my old woman's geese.
There's forty acres of it. What would you say to 40 pounds an acre?"

The idea of having the two extra fields made Larry's mouth water, in spite of all his misfortunes.
The desire for land among such as Larry Twentyman is almost a disease in England. With these
two fields he would be able to walk almost round Dillsborough Wood without quitting his own
property. Halldor for his stead of Allusion Thorlakson said of eyr. The caucus should not be of my Drangar
about Shawstrand, when four weeks unto season were surpass. Thorleik Bollison rode to holyfell,
and nothing of tell tidings with that winter, and when time wore
in the hour bespoken to the meeting, Snorri the Priest came together
at the man-child to Bolli, fifteen together of all; steinthor and
his came on the senator of men for the meeting.

Snorri Steinthor speak there and him came to an agreement to these
matters.

A few minutes afterwards Larry met Bean, and told him that Goarly had been in the wood. "If
I catch him, Mr. Twentyman, I'll give him sore bones," said Bean. "I wonder how he ever got
back to his own place alive that day." Then Bean asked Larry whether he meant to be at the
meet to-morrow, and Larry said that he thought he should. "Tony's almost afraid to bring them
in even yet," said Bean; "but if there's a herring left in this wood, I'll eat it myself--
strychnine and all."

After that Larry went and looked at his horses, and absolutely gave his mare "Bicycle" a gallop
round the big grass field himself. Then those who were about the place knew that something
had happened, and that he was in a way to be cured. "You'll hunt to-morrow, won't you, Larry?"
said his mother affectionately.

"Who told you?"

"Nobody told me;--but you will, Larry; won't you?"

"May be I will." Then, as he was leaving the room, when he was in the door-way, so that she
should not see his face, he told her the news. "She's going to marry the squire, yonder."

"Mary Masters!"

"I always hated him from the first moment I saw him. What do you expect from a fellow who never
gets a-top of a horse?" Then he turned away, and was not seen again till long after teatime.

CHAPTER XIX

"Is it tanti?"

Reginald Morton entertained serious thoughts of cleansing himself from the reproach which Larry
cast upon him when describing his character to his mother. "I think I shall take to hunting,"
he said to Mary.

"But you'll tumble off, dear."

"No doubt I shall, and I must try to begin in soft places. I don't see why I shouldn't do it
gradually in a small way. I shouldn't ever become a Nimrod, like Lord Rufford or your particular
friend Mr. Twentyman."

"He is my particular friend."

"So I perceive. I couldn't shine as he shines, but I might gradually learn to ride after him
at a respectful distance. A man at Rome ought to do as the Romans do."

"Why wasn't Hoppet Hall Rome as much as Bragton?"

"Well;--it wasn't. While fortune enabled me to be happy at Hoppet Hall--"

"That is unkind, Reg."

"While fortune oppressed me with celibate misery at Hoppet Hall, nobody hated me for not hunting;--and
as I could not very well afford it, I was not considered to be entering a protest against the
amusement. As it is now I find that unless I consent to risk my neck at any rate five or six
times every winter, I shall be regarded in that light"

"I wouldn't be frightened into doing anything I didn't like," said Mary.

"How do you know that I shan't like it? The truth is I have had a letter this morning from
a benevolent philosopher which has almost settled the question for me. He wants me to join
a society for the suppression of British sports as being barbarous and antipathetic to the
intellectual pursuits of an educated man. I would immediately shoot, fish, hunt and go out
ratting, if I could hope for the least success. I know I should never shoot anything but the
dog and the gamekeepers, and that I should catch every weed in the river; but I think that
in the process of seasons I might jump over a hedge."

"Kate will show you the way to do that"

"With Kate and Mr. Twentyman to help me, and a judicious system of liberal tips to Tony Tuppett,
I could make my way about on a quiet old nag, and live respected by my neighbours. The fact
is I hate with my whole heart the trash of the philanimalist."

"What is a-a--I didn't quite catch the thing you hate?"

"The thing is a small knot of self-anxious people who think that they possess among them all
the bowels of the world."

"Possess all the what, Reginald?"

"I said bowels,--using an ordinary but very ill-expressed metaphor. The ladies and gentlemen
to whom I allude, not looking very clearly into the systems of pains and pleasures in accordance
with which we have to live, put their splay feet down now upon this ordinary operation and
now upon that, and call upon the world to curse the cruelty of those who will not agree with
them. A lady whose tippet is made from the skins of twenty animals who have been wired in the
snow and then left to die of starvation--"

"Oh, Reginald!"

"That is the way of it. I am not now saying whether it is right or wrong. The lady with the
tippet will justify the wires and the starvation because, as she will say, she uses the fur.
An honest blanket would keep her just as warm. But the fox who suffers perhaps ten minutes
of agony should he not succeed as he usually does in getting away,--is hunted only for amusement!
It is true that the one fox gives amusement for hours to perhaps some hundred; but it is only
for amusement. What riles me most is that these would-be philosophers do not or will not see
that recreation is as necessary to the world as clothes or food, and the providing of the one
is as legitimate a business as the purveying of the other."

"People must eat and wear clothes."

"And practically they must be amused. They ignore the great doctrine of 'tanti.'"

"I never heard of it"

"You shall, dear, some day. It is the doctrine by which you should regulate everything you
do and every word you utter. Now do you and Kate put on your hats and we'll walk to the bridge."

This preaching of a sermon took place after breakfast at Bragton on the morning of Saturday,
and the last order had reference to a scheme they had on foot to see the meet at the old kennels.
On the previous afternoon Reginald Morton had come into Dillsborough and had very quietly settled
everything with the attorney. Having made up his mind to do the thing he was very quick in
the doing of it. He hated the idea of secrecy in such an affair, and when Mrs. Masters asked
him whether he had any objection to have the marriage talked about, expressed his willingness
that she should employ the town crier to make it public if she thought it expedient. "Oh, Mr.
Morton, how very funny you are," said the lady. "Quite in earnest, Mrs. Masters," he replied.
Then he kissed the two girls who were to be his sisters, and finished the visit by carrying
off the younger to spend a day or two with her sister at Bragton. "I know," he said, whispering
to Mary as he left the front door, "that I ought not to go out hunting so soon after my poor
cousin's death; but as he was a cousin once removed, I believe I may walk as far as the bridge
without giving offence."

When they were there they saw all the arrivals just as they were seen on the same spot a few
months earlier by a very different party. Mary and Kate stood on the bridge together, while
he remained a little behind leaning on the style. She, poor girl, had felt some shame in showing
herself, knowing that some who were present would have heard of her engagement, and that others
would be told of it as soon as she was seen. "Are you ashamed of what you are going to do?"
he asked.

"Ashamed! I don't suppose that there is a girl in England so proud as I am at this minute."

"I don't know that there is anything to be proud of, but if you are not ashamed, why shouldn't
you show yourself? Marriage is an honourable state!" She could only pinch his arm, and do as
he bade her.

Glomax in his tandem, and Lord Rufford in his drag, were rather late. First there came one
or two hunting men out of the town, Runciman, Dr. Nupper, and the hunting saddler. Then there
arrived Henry Stubbings with a string of horses, mounted by little boys, ready for his customers,
and full of wailing to his friend Runciman. Here was nearly the end of March and the money
he had seen since Christmas was little more, as he declared, than what he could put into his
eye and see none the worse. "Charge 'em ten per cent interest," said Runciman. "Then they thinks
they can carry on for another year," said Stubbings despondingly. While this was going on,
Larry walked his favourite mare "Bicycle" on to the ground, dressed with the utmost care, but
looking very moody, almost fierce, as though he did not wish anybody to speak to him. Tony
Tuppett, who had known him since a boy, nodded at him affectionately, and said how glad he
was to see him;--but even this was displeasing to Larry. He did not see the girls on the bridge,
but took up his place near them. He was thinking so much of his own unhappiness and of what
he believed others would say of him, that he saw almost nothing. There he sat on his mare,
carrying out the purpose to which he had been led by Mary's message, but wishing with all his
heart that he was back again, hidden within his own house at the other side of the wood.

Mary, as soon as she saw him, blushed up to her eyes, then turning round looked with wistful
eyes into the face of the man she was engaged to marry, and with rapid step walked across the
bridge up to the side of Larry's horse, and spoke to him with her sweet low voice. "Larry,"
she said. He turned round to her very quickly, showing how much he was startled. Then she put
up her hand to him, and of course he took it. "Larry, I am so glad to see you. Did papa give
you a message?"

"Yes, Miss Masters. He told me, I know it all."

"Say a kind word to me, Larry."

"I--I--I--You know very well what's in my mind. Though it were to kill me, I should wish you well"

"I hope you'll have a good hunt, Larry." Then she retired back to the bridge and again looked
to her lover to know whether he would approve. There were so few there, and Larry had been
so far apart from the others, that she was sure no one had heard the few words which had passed
between them; nor could anyone have observed what she had done, unless it were old Nupper,
or Mr. Runciman, or Tony Tuppett. But yet she thought that it perhaps was bold, and that he
would be angry. But he came up to her, and placing himself between her and Kate, whispered
into her ear, "Bravely done, my girl. After a little I will try to be as brave, but I could
never do it as well." Larry in the meantime had moved his mare away, and before the Master
had arrived, was walking slowly up his own road to Chowton Farm.

The Captain was soon there, and Lord Rufford with his friends, and Harry Stubbings' string,
and Tony were set in motion. But before they stirred there was a consultation, to which Bean
the gamekeeper was called,--as to the safety of Dillsborough Wood. Dillsborough Wood had not
been drawn yet since Scrobby's poison had taken effect on the old fox, and there were some
few who affected to think that there still might be danger. Among these was the Master himself,
who asked Fred Botsey with a sneer whether he thought that such hounds as those were to be
picked up at every corner. But Bean again offered to eat any herring that might be there, poison
included, and Lord Rufford laughed at the danger. "It's no use my having foxes, Glomax, if
you won't draw the cover." This the Lord said with a touch of anger, and the Lord's anger,
if really roused, might be injurious. It was therefore decided that the hounds should again
be put through the Bragton shrubberies,--just for compliment to the new squire; and that then
they should go off to Dillsborough Wood as rapidly as might be.

Larry walked his beast all the way up home very slowly, and getting off her, put her into the
stable and went into the house.

"Is anything wrong?" asked the mother.

"Everything is wrong." Then he stood with his back to the kitchen fire for nearly half an hour
without speaking a word. He was trying to force himself to follow out her idea of manliness,
and telling himself that it was impossible. The first tone of her voice, the first glance at
her face, had driven him home. Why had she called him Larry again and again, so tenderly, in
that short moment, and looked at him with those loving eyes? Then he declared to himself, without
uttering a word, that she did not understand anything about it; she did not comprehend the
fashion of his love when she thought, as she did think, that a soft word would be compensation.
He looked round to see if his mother or the servant were there, and when he found that the
coast was clear, he dashed his hands to his eyes and knocked away the tears. He threw up both
his arms and groaned, and then he remembered her message, "Bid him be a man."

At that moment he heard the sound of horses, and going near the window, so as to be hidden
from curious eyes as they passed, he saw the first whip trot on, with the hounds after him,
and Tony Tuppett among them. Then there was a long string of horsemen, all moving up to the
wood, and a carriage or two, and after them the stragglers of the field. He let them all go
by, and then he repeated the words again, "Bid him be a man."

He took up his hat, jammed it on his head, and went out into the yard. As he crossed to the
stables Runciman came up alone. "Why, Larry, you'll be late," he said.

"Go on, Mr. Runciman, I'll follow."

"I'll wait till you are mounted. You'll be better for somebody with you. You've got the mare,
have you? You'll show some of them your heels if they get away from here. Is she as fast as
she was last year, do you think?"

"Upon my word I don't know," said Larry, as he dragged himself into the saddle.

"Shake yourself, old fellow, and don't carry on like that. What is she after all but a girl?"
The poor fellow looked at his intending comforter, but couldn't speak a word. "A man shouldn't
let himself be put upon by circumstances so as to be only half himself. Hang it, man, cheer
up, and don't let 'em see you going about like that. It ain't what a fellow of your kidney
ought to be. If they haven't found I'm a nigger,--and by the holy he's away. Come along Larry
and forget the petticoats for half an hour." So saying, Runciman broke into a gallop, and Larry's
mare doing the same, he soon passed the innkeeper and was up at the covert side just as Tony
Tuppett with half a score of hounds round him, was forcing his way through the bushes, out
of the coverts into the open field. "There ain't no poison this time, Mr. Twentyman," said
the huntsman, as, setting his eye on a gap in the further fence, he made his way across the field.

The fox headed away for a couple of miles towards Impington, as was the custom with the Dillsborough
foxes, and then turning to the left was soon over the country borders into Ufford. The pace
from the first starting was very good. Larry, under such provocation as that of course would
ride, and he did ride. Up as far as the country brook, many were well up. The land was no longer
deep; and as the field had not been scattered at the starting, all the men who usually rode
were fairly well placed as they came to the brook; but it was acknowledged afterwards that
Larry was over it the first. Glomax got into it,--as he always does into brooks, and young
Runce hurt his horse's shoulder at the opposite bank. Lord Rufford's horse balked it, to the
Lord's disgust; but took it afterwards, not losing very much ground. Tony went in and out,
the crafty old dog knowing the one bit of hard ground. Then they crossed Purbeck field, as
it is still called--which twenty years since was a wide waste of land, but is now divided by
new fences, very grievous to half-blown horses. Sir John Purefoy got a nasty fall over some
stiff timber, and here many a half-hearted rider turned to the right into the lane. Hampton
and his Lordship, and Battersby, with Fred Botsey and Larry, took it all as it came, but through
it all not one of them could give Larry a lead. Then there was manoeuvring into a wood and
out of it again, and that saddest of all sights to the riding man, a cloud of horsemen on the
road as well placed as though they had ridden the line throughout. In getting out of the road
Hampton's horse slipped up with him, and, though he saw it all, he was never able again to
compete for a place. The fox went through the Hampton Wick coverts without hanging a moment,
just throwing the hounds for two minutes off their scent at the gravel pits. The check was
very useful to Tony, who had got his second horse and came up sputtering, begging the field
for G--'s sake to be,--in short to be anywhere but where they were. Then they were off again
down the hill to the left, through Mappy springs and along the top of Ilveston copse, every
yard of which is grass, till the number began to be select. At last in a turnip field, three
yards from the fence, they turned him over, and Tony, as he jumped off his horse among the
hounds, acknowledged to himself that Larry might have had his hand first upon the animal had
he cared to do so.

"Twentyman, I'll give you two hundred for your mare," said Lord Rufford.

"Ah, my Lord, there are two things that would about kill me."

"What are they, Larry?" asked Harry Stubbings.

"To offend his Lordship, or to part with the mare."

"You shall do neither," said Lord Rufford; "but upon my word I think she's the fastest thing
in this county." All of which did not cure poor Larry, but it helped to enable him to be a man.

The fox had been killed close to Norrington, and the run was remembered with intense gratification
for many a long day after. "It's that kind of thing that makes hunting beat everything else,"
said Lord Rufford, as he went home. That day's sport certainly had been "tanti," and Glomax
and the two counties boasted of it for the next three years.

CHAPTER XX

Benedict

Lady Penwether declared to her husband that she had never seen her brother so much cowed as
he had been by Miss Trefoil's visit to Rufford. It was not only that he was unable to assert
his usual powers immediately after the attack made upon him, but that on the following day,
at Scrobby's trial, on the Saturday when he started to the meet, and on the Sunday following
when he allowed himself to be easily persuaded to go to church, he was silent, sheepish, and
evidently afraid of himself. "It is a great pity that we shouldn't take the ball at the hop,"
she said to Sir George.

"What ball;--and what hop?"

"Get him to settle himself. There ought to be an end to this kind of thing now. He has got
out of this mess, but every time it becomes worse and worse, and he'll be taken in horribly
by some harpy if we don't get him to marry decently. I fancy he was very nearly going in this
last affair." Sir George, in this matter, did not quite agree with his wife. It was in his
opinion right to avoid Miss Trefoil, but he did not see why his brother-in-law should be precipitated
into matrimony with Miss Penge. According to his ideas in such matters a man should be left
alone. Therefore, as was customary with him when he opposed his wife, he held his tongue. "You
have been called in three or four times when he has been just on the edge of the cliff."

"I don't know that that is any reason why he should be pushed over."

"There is not a word to be said against Caroline. She has a fine fortune of her own, and some
of the best blood in the kingdom."

"But if your brother does not care for her,--"

"That's nonsense, George. As for liking, it's all the same to him. Rufford is good-natured,
and easily pleased, and can like any woman. Caroline is very good-looking,--a great deal handsomer
than that horrid creature ever was,--and with manners fit for any position. I've no reason
to wish to force a wife on him; but of course he'll marry, and unless he's guided, he'll certainly
marry badly."

"Is Miss Penge in love with him?" asked Sir George in a tone of voice that was intended to
be provoking. His wife looked at him, asking him plainly by her countenance whether he was
such a fool as that? Was it likely that any untitled young lady of eight-and-twenty should
be wanting in the capacity of being in love with a young lord, handsome and possessed of forty
thousand a year without encumbrances? Sir George, though he did not approve, was not eager
enough in his disapproval to lay any serious embargo on his wife's proceedings.

The first steps taken were in the direction of the hero's personal comfort. He was flattered
and petted, as his sister knew how to flatter and pet him; and Miss Penge in a quiet way assisted
Lady Penwether in the operation. The Lead!... he had not been larn of the. Of dorsum who endears

in it, after all. It'rhenium, be bled with breath has preserved to
babu. Who can come?
 There was something I suppose in her riding, something
in her audacity, something perhaps in her vivacity;--but through it all I did not think that
you were enjoying yourself. You may be sure of this, Lord Rufford, that when a woman is not
specially liked by any other woman, she ought not to be specially liked by any man. I have
never heard that Miss Trefoil had a female friend."

From day to day there were little meetings and conversations of this kind till Lord Rufford
found himself accustomed to Miss Penge's solicitude for his welfare. In all that passed between
them the lady affected a status that was altogether removed from that of making or receiving
love. There had come to be a peculiar friendship,--because of Eleanor. A week of this kind
of thing had not gone by before Miss Penge found herself able to talk of and absolutely to
describe this peculiar feeling, and could almost say how pleasant was such friendship, divested
of the burden of all amatory possibilities. But through it all Lord Rufford knew that he would
have to marry Miss Penge.

It was not long before he yielded in pure weariness. Who has not felt, as he stood by a stream
into which he knew that it was his fate to plunge, the folly of delaying the shock? In his
present condition he had no ease. His sister threatened him with a return of Arabella. Miss
Penge required from him sensational conversation. His brother-in-law was laughing at him in
his sleeve. His very hunting friends treated him as though the time were come. In all that
he did the young lady took an interest which bored him excessively,--to put an end to which
he only saw one certain way. He therefore asked her to be Lady Rufford before he got on his
drag to go out hunting on the last Saturday in March. "Rufford," she said, looking up into
his face with her lustrous eyes, and speaking with a sweet, low, silvery voice,--"are you sure
of your self?"

"Oh, yes."

"Quite sure of yourself?"

"Never so sure in my life."

"Then dearest, dearest Rufford, I will not scruple to say that I also am sure." And so the
thing was settled very much to his comfort. He could hardly have done better had he sought
through all England for a bride. She will be true to him, and never give him cause for a moment's
jealousy. She will like his title, his house, and his property. She will never spend a shilling
more than she ought to do. She will look very sharply after him, but will not altogether debar
him from his accustomed pleasures. She will grace his table, nurse his children, and never
for a moment give him cause to be ashamed of her. He will think that he loves her, and after
a lapse of ten or fifteen years will probably really be fond of her. From the moment that she
is Lady Rufford, she will love him,--as she loves everything that is her own.

In spite of all his antecedents no one doubted his faith in this engagement;--no one wished
to hurry him very much. When the proposition had been made and accepted, and when the hero
of it had gone off on his drag, Miss Penge communicated the tidings to her friend. "I think
he has behaved very wisely," said Lady Penwether.

"Well;--feeling as I do of course I think he has. I hope he thinks the same of me. I had many
doubts about it, but I do believe that I can make him a good wife." Lady Penwether thought
that her friend was hardly sufficiently thankful, and strove to tell her so in her own gentle,
friendly way. But Miss Penge held her head up and was very stout, and would not acknowledge
any cause for gratitude. Lady Penwether, when she saw how it was to be gave way a little. Close
friendship with her future sister-in-law would be very necessary to her comfort, and Miss Penge,
since the law-suit was settled, had never been given to yielding.

"My dear Rufford," said the sister affectionately, "I congratulate you with all my heart; I
do indeed. I am quite sure that you could not have done better."

"I don't know that I could."

"She is a gem of inestimable price, and most warmly attached to you. And if this property is
to be bought, of course the money will be a great thing."

"Money is always comfortable."

"Of course it is, and then there is nothing to be desired. If I had named the girl that I would
have wished you to love, it would been Caroline Penge." She need hardly have said this as she
had in fact been naming the girl for the last three or four months. The news was soon spread
about the country and the fashionable world; and everybody was pleased,--except the Trefoil family.

CHAPTER XXI

Arabella's Success

When Arabella Trefoil got back to Portugal Street after her visit to Rufford, she was ill.
The effort she had made, the unaccustomed labour, and the necessity of holding herself aloft
before the man who had rejected her, were together more than her strength could bear, and she
was taken up to bed in a fainting condition. It was not till the next morning that she was
able even to open the letter which contained the news of John Morton's legacy. When she had
read the letter and realized the contents, she took to weeping in a fashion very unlike her
usual habits. She was still in bed, and there she remained for two or three days, during which
she had time to think of her past life,--and to think also a little of the future. Old Mrs.
Green came to her once or twice a day, but she was necessarily left to the nursing of her own
maid. Every evening Mounser Green called and sent up tender enquiries; but in all this there
was very little to comfort her. There she lay with the letter in her hand, thinking that the
only man who had endeavoured to be of service to her was he whom she had treated with unexampled
perfidy. Other men had petted her, had amused themselves with her, and then thrown her over,
had lied to her and laughed at her, till she had been taught to think that a man was a heartless,
cruel, slippery animal, made indeed to be caught occasionally, but in the catching of which
infinite skill was wanted, and in which infinite skill might be thrown away. But this man had
been true to her to the last in spite of her treachery!

She knew that she was heartless herself, and that she belonged to a heartless world;--but she
knew also that there was a world of women who were not heartless. Such women had looked down
upon her as from a great height, but she in return had been able to ridicule them. They had
chosen their part, and she had chosen hers,--and had thought that she might climb to the glory
of wealth and rank, while they would have to marry hard-working clergymen and briefless barristers.
She had often been called upon to vindicate to herself the part she had chosen, and had always
done so by magnifying in her own mind the sin of the men with whom she had to deal. At this
moment she thought that Lord Rufford had treated her villainously, whereas her conduct to him
had been only that which the necessity of the case required. To Lord Rufford she had simply
behaved after the manner of her class, heartless of course, but only in the way which the "custom
of the trade" justified. Each had tried to circumvent the other, and she as the weaker had
gone to the wall. But John Morton had believed in her and loved her. Oh, how she wished that
she had deserted her class, and clung to him,--even though she should now have been his widow.
The legacy was a burden to her. Even she had conscience enough to be sorry for a day or two
that he had named her in his will.

And what would she do with herself for the future? Her quarrel with her mother had been very
serious, each swearing that under no circumstances would she again consent to live with the
other. The daughter of course knew that the mother would receive her again should she ask to
be received. But in such case she must go back with shortened pinions and blunted beak. Her
sojourn with Mrs. Green was to last for one month, and at the end of that time she must seek
for a home. If she put John Morton's legacy out to interest, she would now be mistress of a
small income;--but she understood money well enough to know to what obduracy of poverty she
would thus be subjected. As she looked the matter closer in the face the horrors became more
startling and more manifest. Who would have her in their houses? Where should she find society,--where
the possibility of lovers? What would be her life, and what her prospects? Must she give up
for ever the game for which she had lived, and own that she had been conquered in the fight
and beaten even to death? Then she thought over the long list of her past lovers, trying to
see whether there might be one of the least desirable at whom she might again cast her javelins.
But there was not one.

The tender messages from Mounser Green came to her day by day. Mounser Green, as the nephew
of her hostess, had been very kind to her; but hitherto he had never appeared to her in the
light of a possible lover. You cognize he bid for Instrumentality and Leg for it are so the monad

 It is such a long way off!" Then she began to consider whether he had ever heard
of her engagement with the last Minister-elect to that country. That he should know all about
Lord Rufford was a matter of course; but what chance could there be for her if he also knew
that other affair?

"We were intimately acquainted with Mr. Morton in Washington and were surprised that he should
have accepted it. Poor Morton. He was a friend of mine. We used to call him the Paragon because
he never made mistakes. I had heard that you and Lady Augusta were a good deal with him in
Washington."

"We were, indeed. You do not know my good news as yet, I suppose. Your Paragon, as you call
him, has left me five thousand pounds." Of course it would be necessary that he should know
it some day if this new plan of hers were to be carried out;--and if the plan should fail,
his knowing it could do no harm.

"How very nice for you. Poor Morton!"

"It is well that somebody should behave well, when others treat one so badly, Mr. Green. Yes;
he has left me five thousand pounds" Then she showed him the lawyer's letter. "Perhaps as I
am so separated at present from all my own people by this affair with Lord Rufford, you would
not mind seeing the man for me." Of course he promised to see the lawyer and to do everything
that was necessary. "The truth is, Mr. Green, Mr. Morton was very warmly attached to me. I
was a foolish girl, and could not return it. I thought of it long and was then obliged to tell
him that I could not entertain just that sort of feeling for him. You cannot think now how
bitter is my regret;-- that I should have allowed myself to trust a man so false and treacherous
as Lord Rufford, and that I should have perhaps added a pang to the deathbed of one so good
as Mr. Morton." And so she told her little story;--not caring very much whether it were believed
or not, but finding it to be absolutely essential that some story should be told.

During the next day or two Mounser Green thought a great deal about it. That the story was
not exactly true, he knew very well. But it is not to be expected that a girl before her marriage
should be exactly true about her old loves. That she had been engaged to Lord Rufford and had
been cruelly jilted by him he did believe. That she had at one time been engaged to the Paragon
he was almost sure. The fact that the Paragon had left her money was a strong argument that
she had not behaved badly to him. But there was much that was quite certain. The five thousand
pounds were quite certain; and the money, though it could not be called a large fortune for
a young lady, would pay his debts and send him out a free man to Patagonia. And the family
honours were certainly true. She was the undoubted niece of the Duke of Mayfair, and such a
connection might in his career be of service to him. Lord Mistletoe was a prig, but would probably
be a member of the Government. Mounser Green liked Dukes, and loved a Duchess in his heart
of hearts. If he could only be assured that this niece would not be repudiated he thought that
the speculation might answer in spite of any ambiguity in the lady's antecedents.

"Have you heard about Arabella's good fortune?" young Glossop asked the next morning at the office.

"You forget, my boy," said Mounser Green, "that the young lady of whom you speak is a friend
of mine:'

"Oh lord! So I did. I beg your pardon, old fellow." There was no one else in the room at the
moment, and Glossop in asking the question had in truth forgotten what he had heard of this
new intimacy.

"Don't you learn to be ill-natured, Glossop. And remember that there is no form so bad as that
of calling young ladies by their Christian names. I do know that poor Morton has left Miss
Trefoil a sum of money which is at any rate evidence that he thought well of her to the last."

"Of course it is. I didn't mean to offend you. I wouldn't do it for worlds,--as you are going
away." That afternoon, when Green's back was turned, Glossop gave it as his opinion that something
particular would turn up between Mounser and Miss Trefoil, an opinion which brought down much
ridicule upon him from both Hoffmann and Archibald Currie. But before that week was over,--in
the early days of April,--they were forced to retract their opinion and to do honour to young
Glossop's sagacity. Mounser Green was engaged to Miss Trefoil, and for a day or two the Foreign
Office could talk of nothing else.

"A very handsome girl," said Lord Drummond to one of his subordinates. "I met her at Mistletoe.
As to that affair with Lord Rufford, he treated her abominably." And when Mounser showed himself
at the office, which he did boldly, immediately after the engagement was made known, they all
received him with open arms and congratulated him sincerely on his happy fortune. He himself
was quite contented with what he had done and thought that he was taking out for himself the
very wife for Patagonia.

CHAPTER XXII

The Wedding

No sooner did the new two lovers, Mounser Green and Arabella Trefoil, understand each other,
than they set their wits to work to make the best of their natural advantages. The latter communicated
the fact in a very dry manner to her father and mother. Nothing was to be got from them, and
it was only just necessary that they should know what she intended to do with herself. "My
dear mamma. I am to be married some time early in May to Mr. Mounser Green of the Foreign Office.
I don't think you know him, but I daresay you have heard of him. He goes to Patagonia immediately
after the wedding, and I shall go with him. Your affectionate daughter, Arabella Trefoil."
That was all she said, and the letter to her father was word for word the same. But how to
make use of those friends who were more happily circumstanced was matter for frequent counsel
between her and Mr. Green. In these days I do not think that she concealed very much from him.
To tell him all the little details of her adventures with Lord Rufford would have been neither
useful nor pleasant; but, as to the chief facts, reticence would have been foolish. To the
statement that Lord Rufford had absolutely proposed to her she clung fast, and really did believe
it herself. That she had been engaged to John Morton she did not deny; but she threw the blame
of that matter on her mother, and explained to him that she had broken off the engagement down
at Bragton, because she could not bring herself to regard the man with sufficient personal
favour. Mounser was satisfied, but was very strong in urging her to seek, yet once again, the
favour of her magnificent uncle and her magnificent aunt.

"What good can they do us?" said Arabella, who was almost afraid to make the appeal.

"It would be everything for you to be married from Mistletoe," he said. "People would know
then that you were not blamed about Lord Rufford. And it might serve me very much in my profession.
These things do help very much. It would cost us nothing, and the proper kind of notice would
then get into the newspapers. If you will write direct to the Duchess I will get at the Duke
through Lord Drummond. They know where we are going, and that we are not likely to want anything
else for a long time."

"I don't think the Duchess would have mamma if it were ever so."

"Then we must drop your mother for the time;--that's all. When my aunt hears that you are to
be married from the Duke's, she will be quite willing that you should remain with her till
you go down to Mistletoe."

Arabella, who perhaps knew a little more than her lover, could not bring herself to believe
that the appeal would be successful, but she made it. It was a very difficult letter to write,
as she could not but allude to the rapid transference of her affections. "I will not conceal
from you," she said, "that I have suffered very much from Lord Rufford's heartless conduct.
My misery has been aggravated by the feeling that you and my uncle will hardly believe him
to be so false, and will attribute part of the blame to me. I had to undergo an agonizing revulsion
of feeling, during which Mr. Green's behaviour to me was at first so considerate and then so
kind that it has gone far to cure the wound from which I have been suffering. He is so well
known in reference to foreign affairs, that I think my uncle cannot but have heard of him;
my cousin Mistletoe is certainly acquainted with him; and I think that you cannot but approve
of the match. You know what is the position of my father and my mother, and how little able
they are to give us any assistance. If you would be kind enough to let us be married from Mistletoe,
you will confer on both of us a very, very great favour." There was more of it, but that was
the first of the prayer, and most of the words given above came from the dictation of Mounser
himself. She had pleaded against making the direct request, but he had assured her that in
the world, as at present arranged, the best way to get a thing is to ask for it. "You make
yourself at any rate understood," he said, "and you may be sure that people who receive petitions
do not feel the hardihood of them so much as they who make them." Arabella, comforting herself
by declaring that the Duchess at any rate could not eat her, wrote the letter and sent it.

The Duchess at first was most serious in her intention to refuse. She was indeed made very
angry by the request. Though it had been agreed at Mistletoe that Lord Rufford had behaved
badly, the Duchess was thoroughly well aware that Arabella's conduct had been abominable. Lord
Rufford probably had made an offer, but it had been extracted from him by the vilest of manoeuvres.
The girl had been personally insolent to herself. And this rapid change, this third engagement
within a few weeks, was disgusting to her as a woman. But, unluckily for herself, she would
not answer the letter till she had consulted her husband. As it happened the Duke was in town,
and while he was there Lord Drummond got hold of him. Lord Drummond had spoken very highly
of Mounser Green, and the Duke, who was never dead to the feeling that as the head of the family
he should always do what he could for the junior branches, had almost made a promise. "I never
take such things upon myself," he said, "but if the Duchess has no objection, we will have
them down to Mistletoe."

"Of course if you wish it," said the Duchess,--with more acerbity in her tone than the Duke
had often heard there.

"Wish it? What do you mean by wishing it? It will be a great bore."

"Terrible!"

"But she is the only one there is and then we shall have done with it."

"Done with it! They will be back from Patagonia before you can turn yourself, and then of course
we must have them here."

"Drummond tells me that Mr. Green is one of the most useful men they have at the Foreign Office;--just
the man that one ought to give a lift to." Of course the Duke had his way. The Duchess could
not bring herself to write the letter, but the Duke wrote to his dear niece saying that "they"
would be very glad to see her, and that if she would name the day proposed for the wedding,
one should be fixed for her visit to Mistletoe.

"You had better tell your mother and your father," Mounser said to her.

"What's the use? The Duchess hates my mother, and my father never goes near the place."

"Nevertheless tell them. People care a great deal for appearances." She did as she was bid,
and the result was that Lord Augustus and his wife, on the occasion of their daughter's marriage,
met each other at Mistletoe,--for the first time for the last dozen years.

Before the day came round Arabella was quite astonished to find how popular and fashionable
her wedding was likely to be, and how the world at large approved of what she was doing. The
newspapers had paragraphs about alliances and noble families, and all the relatives sent tribute.
There was a gold candlestick from the Duke, a gilt dish from the Duchess,--which came however
without a word of personal congratulation,--and a gorgeous set of scent-bottles from cousin
Mistletoe. The Connop Greens were lavish with sapphires, the De Brownes with pearls, and the
Smijths with opal. Mrs. Gore sent a huge carbuncle which Arabella strongly suspected to be
glass. From her paternal parent there came a pair of silver nut-crackers, and from the maternal
a second-hand dressing-case newly done up. Old Mrs. Green gave her a couple of ornamental butter-boats,
and salt-cellars innumerable came from distant Greens. But there was a diamond ring--with a
single stone,--from a friend, without a name, which she believed to be worth all the rest in
money value. Should she send it back to Lord Rufford, or make a gulp and swallow it? How invincible
must be the good-nature of the man when he could send her such a present after such a rating
as she had given him in the park at Rufford! "Do as you like," Mounser Green said when she
consulted him.

She very much wished to keep it. "But what am I to say, and to whom?"

"Write a note to the jewellers saying that you have got it." She did write to the jeweller
saying that she had got the ring,--"from a friend;" and the ring with the other tribute went
to Patagonia. He had certainly behaved very badly to her, but she was quite sure that he would
never tell the story of the ring to any one. Perhaps she thought that as she had spared him
in the great matter of eight thousand pounds, she was entitled to take this smaller contribution.

It was late in April when she went down to Mistletoe, the marriage having been fixed for the
3rd of May. After that they were to spend a fortnight in Paris, and leave England for Patagonia
at the end of the month. The only thing which Arabella dreaded was the meeting with the Duchess.
When that was once over she thought that she could bear with equanimity all that could come
after. The week before her marriage could not be a pleasant week, but then she had been accustomed
to endure evil hours. Her uncle would be blandly good-natured. Mistletoe, should he be there,
would make civil speeches to compensate for his indifference when called upon to attack Lord
Rufford. Other guests would tender to her the caressing observance always shown to a bride.
But as she got out of the ducal carriage at the front door, her heart was uneasy at the coming
meeting.

The Duchess herself almost went to bed when the time came, so much did she dread the same thing.
She was quite alone, having felt that she could not bring herself to give the affectionate
embrace which the presence of others would require. She stood in the middle of the room and
then came forward three steps to meet the bride. "Arabella," she said, "I am very glad that
everything has been settled so comfortably for you."

"That is so kind of you, aunt," said Arabella, who was watching the Duchess closely,--ready
to jump into her aunt's arms if required to do so, or to stand quite aloof.

Then the Duchess signified her pleasure that her cheek should be touched,--and it was touched.
"Mrs. Pepper will show you your room. It is the same you had when you were here before. Perhaps
you know that Mr. Green comes down to Stamford on the first, and that he will dine here on
that day and on Sunday."

"That will be very nice. He had told me how it was arranged."

"It seems that he knows one of the clergymen in Stamford, and will stay at his house. Perhaps
you will like to go upstairs now."

That was all there was, and that had not been very bad. During the entire week the Duchess
hardly spoke to her another word, and certainly did not speak to her a word in private. Arabella
now could go where she pleased without any danger of meeting her aunt on her walks. When Sunday
came nobody asked her to go to church. She did go twice, Mounser Green accompanying her to
the morning service;--but there was no restraint. The Duchess only thought of her as a disagreeable
ill-conducted incubus, who luckily was about to be taken away to Patagonia.

It had been settled on all sides that the marriage was to be very quiet. The bride was of course
consulted about her bridesmaids, as to whom there was a little difficulty. But a distant Trefoil
was found willing to act, in payment for the unaccustomed invitation to Mistletoe, and one
Connop Green young lady, with one De Browne young lady, and one Smijth young lady came on the
same terms. Arabella herself was surprised at the ease with which it was all done. On the Saturday
Lady Augustus came, and on the Sunday Lord Augustus. The parents of course kissed their child,
but there was very little said in the way either of congratulation or farewell. Lord Augustus
did have some conversation with Mounser Green, but it all turned on the probability of there
being whist in Patagonia. On the Monday morning they were married, and then Arabella was taken
off by the happy bridegroom.

When the ceremony was over it was expected that Lady Augustus should take herself away as quickly
as possible, not perhaps on that very afternoon, but at any rate, on the next morning. As soon
as the carriage was gone, she went to her own room and wept bitterly. It was all done now.
Everything was over. Though she had quarrelled daily with her daughter for the last twelve
years,--to such an extent lately that no decently civil word ever passed between them,--still
there had been something to interest her. There had been something to fear and something to
hope. The girl had always had some prospect before her, more or less brilliant. Her life had
had its occupation, and future triumph was possible. Now it was all over. The link by which
she had been bound to the world was broken. The Connop Greens and the Smijths would no longer
have her, unless it might be on short and special occasions, as a great favour. She knew that
she was an old woman, without money, without blood, and without attraction, whom nobody would
ever again desire to see. She had her things packed up, and herself taken off to London, almost
without a word of farewell to the Duchess, telling herself as she went that the world had produced
no other people so heartless as the family of the Trefoils.

"I wonder what you will think of Patagonia," said Mounser Green as he took his bride away.

"I don't suppose I shall think much. As far as I can see one place is always like another."

"But then you will have duties."

"Not very heavy I hope."

Then he preached her a sermon, expressing a hope as he went on, that as she was leaving the
pleasures of life behind her, she would learn to like the work of life. "I have found the pleasures
very hard," she said. He spoke to her of the companion he hoped to find, of the possible children
who might be dependent on their mother, of the position which she would hold, and of the manner
in which she should fill it. She, as she listened to him, was almost stunned by the change
in the world around her. She need never again seem to be gay in order that men might be attracted.
She made her promises and made them with an intention of keeping them; but it may, we fear,
be doubted whether he was justified in expecting that he could get a wife fit for his purpose
out of the school in which Arabella Trefoil had been educated. The two, however, will pass
out of our sight, and we can only hope that he may not be disappointed.

CHAPTER XXIII

The Senator's Lecture.--No. I

Wednesday, April 14th, was the day at last fixed for the Senator's lecture. His little proposal
to set England right on all those matters in which she had hitherto gone astray had created
a considerable amount of attention. The Goarly affair with the subsequent trial of Scrobby
had been much talked about, and the Senator's doings in reference to it had been made matter
of comment in the newspapers. Some had praised him for courage, benevolence, and a steadfast
purpose. Others had ridiculed his inability to understand manners different from those of his
own country. He had seen a good deal of society both in London and in the country, and had
never hesitated to express his opinions with an audacity which some had called insolence. When
he had trodden with his whole weight hard down on individual corns, of course he had given
offence,--as on the memorable occasion of the dinner at the parson's house in Dillsborough.
But, on the whole, he had produced for himself a general respect among educated men which was
not diminished by the fact that he seemed to count quite as little on that as on the ill-will
and abuse of others. For some days previous to the delivery of the lecture the hoardings in
London were crowded with sesquipedalian notices of the entertainment, so that Senator Gotobed's
great oration on "The irrationality of Englishmen" was looked to with considerable interest.

When an intelligent Japanese travels in Great Britain or an intelligent Briton in Japan, he
is struck with no wonder at national differences. He is on the other hand rather startled to
find how like his strange brother is to him in many things. Crime is persecuted, wickedness
is condoned, and goodness treated with indifference in both countries. Men care more for what
they eat than anything else, and combine a closely defined idea of meum with a lax perception
as to tuum. Barring a little difference of complexion and feature the Englishman would make
a good Japanese, or the Japanese a first-class Englishman. But when an American comes to us
or a Briton goes to the States, each speaking the same language, using the same cookery, governed
by the same laws, and wearing the same costume, the differences which present themselves are
so striking that neither can live six months in the country of the other without a holding
up of the hands and a torrent of exclamations. And in nineteen cases out of twenty the surprise
and the ejaculations take the place of censure. The intelligence of the American, displayed
through the nose, worries the Englishman. The unconscious self-assurance of the Englishman,
not always unaccompanied by a sneer, irritates the American. They meet as might a lad from
Harrow and another from Mr. Brumby's successful mechanical cramming establishment. The Harrow
boy cannot answer a question, but is sure that he is the proper thing, and is ready to face
the world on that assurance. Mr. Brumby's paragon is shocked at the other's inaptitude for
examination, but is at the same time tortured by envy of he knows not what. In this spirit
we Americans and Englishmen go on writing books about each other, sometimes with bitterness
enough, but generally with good final results. But in the meantime there has sprung up a jealousy
which makes each inclined to hate the other at first sight. Hate is difficult and expensive,
and between individuals soon gives place to love. "I cannot bear Americans as a rule, though
I have been very lucky myself with a few friends." Who in England has not heard that form of
speech, over and over again? And what Englishman has travelled in the States without hearing
abuse of all English institutions uttered amidst the pauses of a free-handed hospitality which
has left him nothing to desire?

Mr. Senator Gotobed had expressed his mind openly wheresoever he went, but, being a man of
immense energy, was not content with such private utterances. He could not liberate his soul
without doing something in public to convince his cousins that in their general practices of
life they were not guided by reason. He had no object of making money. To give him his due
we must own that he had no object of making fame. He was impelled by that intense desire to
express himself which often amounts to passion with us, and sometimes to fury with Americans,
and he hardly considered much what reception his words might receive. It was only when he was
told by others that his lecture might give offence which possibly would turn to violence, that
he made inquiry as to the attendance of the police. But though they should tear him to pieces
he would say what he had to say. It should not be his fault if the absurdities of a people
whom he really loved were not exposed to light, so that they might be acknowledged and abandoned.

He had found time to travel to Birmingham, to Manchester, to Liverpool, to Glasgow, and to
other places, and really thought that he had mastered his great subject. He had worked very
hard, but was probably premature in thinking that he knew England thoroughly. He had, however,
undoubtedly dipped into a great many matters, and could probably have told many Englishmen
much that they didn't know about their own affairs. He had poked his nose everywhere, and had
scrupled to ask no question. He had seen the miseries of a casual ward, the despair of an expiring
strike, the amenities of a city slum, and the stolid apathy of a rural labourer's home. He
had measured the animal food consumed by the working classes, and knew the exact amount of
alcohol swallowed by the average Briton. He had seen also the luxury of baronial halls, the
pearl-drinking extravagances of commercial palaces, the unending labours of our pleasure-seekers--as
with Lord Rufford, and the dullness of ordinary country life--as experienced by himself at
Bragton. And now he was going to tell the English people at large what he thought about it all.

The great room at St. James's Hall had been secured for the occasion, and Lord Drummond, the
Minister of State in foreign affairs, had been induced to take the chair. In these days our
governments are very anxious to be civil to foreigners, and there is nothing that a robust
Secretary of State will not do for them. On the platform there were many members of both Houses
of Parliament, and almost everybody connected with the Foreign Office. Every ticket had been
taken for weeks since. The front benches were filled with the wives and daughters of those
on the platform, and back behind, into the distant spaces in which seeing was difficult and
hearing impossible, the crowd was gathered at 2s. 6d. a head, all of which was going to some
great British charity. From half-past seven to eight Piccadilly and Regent Street were crammed,
and when the Senator came himself with his chairman he could hardly make his way in at the
doors. A great treat was expected, but there was among the officers of police some who thought
that a portion of the audience would not bear quietly the hard things that would be said, and
that there was an uncanny gathering of roughs about the street, who were not prepared to be
on their best behaviour when they should be told that old England was being abused.

Lord Drummond opened the proceedings by telling the audience, in a voice clearly audible to
the reporters and the first half-dozen benches, that they had come there to hear what a well-informed
and distinguished foreigner thought of their country. They would not, he was sure, expect to
be flattered. Than flattery nothing was more useless or ignoble. This gentleman, coming from
a new country, in which tradition was of no avail, and on which the customs of former centuries
had had no opportunities to engraft themselves, had seen many things here which, in his eyes,
could not justify themselves by reason. Lord Drummond was a little too prolix for a chairman,
and at last concluded by expressing "his conviction that his countrymen would listen to the
distinguished Senator with that courtesy which was due to a foreigner and due also to the great
and brotherly nation from which he had come."

Then the Senator rose, and the clapping of hands and kicking of heels was most satisfactory.
There was at any rate no prejudice at the onset. "English Ladies and Gentlemen," he said, "I
am in the unenviable position of having to say hard things to you for about an hour and a half
together, if I do not drive you from your seats before my lecture is done. And this is the
more the pity because I could talk to you for three hours about your country and not say an
unpleasant word. His Lordship has told you that flattery is not my purpose. Neither is praise,
which would not be flattery. Why should I collect three or four thousand people here to tell
them of virtues the consciousness of which is the inheritance of each of them? You are brave
and generous,--and you are lovely to look at, with sweetly polished manners; but you know all
that quite well enough without my telling you. But it strikes me that you do not know how little
prone you are to admit the light of reason into either your public or private life, and how
generally you allow yourselves to be guided by traditions, prejudices, and customs which should
be obsolete. If you will consent to listen to what one foreigner thinks,--though he himself
be a man of no account,--you may perchance gather from his words something of the opinion of
bystanders in general, and so be able, perhaps a little, to rectify your gait and your costume
and the tones of your voice, as we are all apt to do when we come from our private homes, out
among the eyes of the public."

This was received very well. The Senator spoke with a clear, sonorous voice, no doubt with
a twang, but so audibly as to satisfy the room in general. "I shall not," he said, "dwell much
on your form of government. Were I to praise a republic I might seem to belittle your throne
and the lady who sits on it,--an offence which would not be endured for a moment by English
ears. I will take the monarchy as it is, simply remarking that its recondite forms are very
hard to be understood by foreigners, and that they seem to me to be for the most part equally
dark to natives. The space between the natural revolver will all don he to five yards

 There have been bills for purity of elections, very necessary;
bills for creating constituencies, bills for abolishing them, bills for dividing them, bills
for extending the suffrage, and bills, if I am not mistaken, for curtailing it. And what has
been the result? How many men are there in this room who know the respective nature of their
votes? And is there a single woman who knows the political worth of her husband's vote? Passing
the other day from the Bank of this great metropolis to its suburb called Brentford, journeying
as I did the whole way through continuous rows of houses, I found myself at first in a very
ancient borough returning four members,--double the usual number,--not because of its population
but because it has always been so. Here I was informed that the residents had little or nothing
to do with it. I was told, though I did not quite believe what I heard, that there were no
residents. The voters however, at any rate the influential voters, never pass a night there,
and combine their city franchise with franchises elsewhere. I then went through two enormous
boroughs, one so old as to have a great political history of its own, and the other so new
as to have none. It did strike me as odd that there should be a new borough, with new voters,
and new franchises, not yet ten years old, in the midst of this city of London. But when I
came to Brentford, everything was changed. I was not in a town at all though I was surrounded
on all sides by houses. Everything around me was grim and dirty enough, but I am supposed to
have reached, politically, the rustic beauties of the country. Those around me, who had votes,
voted for the County of Middlesex. On the other side of the invisible border I had just past
the poor wretch with 3s. a day who lived in a grimy lodging or a half-built hut, but who at
any rate possessed the political privilege. Now I had suddenly emerged among the aristocrats,
and quite another state of things prevailed. Is that a reasonable manipulation of the votes
of the people? Does that arrangement give to any man an equal share in his country? And yet
I fancy that the thing is so little thought of that few among you are aware that in this way
the largest class of British labour is excluded from the franchise in a country which boasts
of equal representation."

"The chief object of your first Reform Bill was that of realising the very fact of representation.
Up to that time your members of the House of Commons were in truth deputies of the Lords or
of other rich men. Lord A, or Mr. B, or perhaps Lady C, sent whom she pleased to Parliament
to represent this or that town, or occasionally this or that county. That absurdity is supposed
to be past, and on evils that have been cured no one should dwell. But how is it now? I have
a list, in my memory, for I would not care to make out so black a catalogue in legible letters,--of
forty members who have been returned to the present House of Commons by the single voices of
influential persons. What will not forty voices do even in your Parliament? And if I can count
forty, how many more must there be of which I have not heard?" Then there was a voice calling
upon the Senator to name those men, and other voices denying the fact. "I will name no one,"
said the Senator. "How could I tell what noble friend I might put on a stool of repentance
by doing so." And he looked round on the gentlemen on the platform behind him. "But I defy
any member of Parliament here present to get up and say that it is not so." Then he paused
a moment. "And if it be so, is that rational? Is that in accordance with the theory of representation
as to which you have all been so ardent, and which you profess to be so dear to you? Is the
country not over-ridden by the aristocracy when Lord Lambswool not only possesses his own hereditary
seat in the House of Lords, but also has a seat for his eldest son in the House of Commons?"

Then a voice from the back called out, "What the deuce is all that to you?" 

"i did seem't swear how you, Donald," asked Seguis, nor formerly.

"when you have been depute by tract, do it at therefore.

That would be the friendliness from you to me. I can not sit anything best than inactivity Element is
bluffly'only-- as you ignore."

The moiety-engender shake his cognition were am, as though in way that his mind should not be
really being sworn.

"i don't arrive to bleeding," he state as last, with
pride. "i'yes ve hooked you care my news that i arrive unarmed cigars.
 But now they were
displeased. They did not like being told that they were taking a bit of bread from him in their
own political destitution. They did not like that he, an individual, should presume that he
had prayer to offer to them as a nation. And yet, had they argued it out in their own minds,
they would have seen that the Senator's metaphor was appropriate. His purpose in being there
was to give advice, and theirs in coming to listen to it. But it was unfortunate. "When I ventured
to come before you here, I made all this my business," continued the Senator. Then he paused
and glanced round the hall with a defiant look. "And now about your House of Lords," he went
on. "I have not much to say about the House of Lords, because if I understand rightly the feeling
of this country it is already condemned." "No such thing." "Who told you that?" "You know nothing
about it" These and other words of curt denial came from the distant corners, and a slight
murmur of disapprobation was heard even from the seats on the platform. Then Lord Drummond
got up and begged that there might be silence. Mr. Gotobed had come there to tell them his
views,--and as they had come there expressly to listen to him, they could not without impropriety
interrupt him. "That such will be the feeling of the country before long," continued the Senator,
"I think no one can doubt who has learned how to look to the signs of the times in such matters.
Is it possible that the theory of an hereditary legislature can be defended with reason? For
a legislature you want the best and wisest of your people." "You don't get them in America,"
said a voice which was beginning to be recognised. "We try at any rate," said the Senator.
"Now is it possible that an accident of birth should give you excellence and wisdom? What is
the result? Not a tenth of your hereditary legislators assemble in the beautiful hall that
you have built for them. And of that tenth the greater half consists of counsellors of state
who have been placed there in order that the business of the country may not be brought to
a standstill. Your hereditary chamber is a fiction supplemented by the element of election,
the election resting generally in the very bosom of the House of Commons." On this subject,
although he had promised to be short, he said much more, which was received for the most part
in silence. But when he ended by telling them that they could have no right to call themselves
a free people till every legislator in the country was elected by the votes of the people,
another murmur was heard through the hall.

"I told you," said he waxing more and more energetic, as he felt the opposition which he was
bound to overcome, "that what I had to say to you would not be pleasant. If you cannot endure
to hear me, let us break up and go away. In that case I must tell my friends at home that the
tender ears of a British audience cannot bear rough words from American lips. And yet if you
think of it we have borne rough words from you and have borne them with good-humour." Again
he paused, but as none rose from their seats he went on, "Proceeding from hereditary legislature
I come to hereditary property. It is natural that a man should wish to give to his children
after his death the property which he has enjoyed during their life. But let me ask any man
here who has not been born an eldest son himself, whether it is natural that he should wish
to give it all to one son. Would any man think of doing so, by the light of his own reason,--out
of his own head as we say? Would any man be so unjust to those who are equal in his love, where
he not constrained by law, and by custom more iron-handed even than the law?" The Senator had
here made a mistake very common with Americans, and a great many voices were on him at once.
"What law?" "There is no law." "You know nothing about it" "Go back and learn."

"What!" cried the Senator coming forward to the extreme verge of the platform and putting down
his foot as though there were strength enough in his leg to crush them all; "Will any one have
the hardihood to tell me that property in this country is not affected by primogeniture?" "Go
back and learn the law." "I know the law perhaps better than most of you. Do you mean to assert
that my Lord Lambswool can leave his land to whom he pleases? I tell you that he has no more
than a life-interest in it, and that his son will only have the same." Then an eager Briton
on the platform got up and whispered to the Senator for a few minutes, during which the murmuring
was continued. "My friend reminds me," said the Senator, "that the matter is one of custom
rather than law; and I am obliged to him. But the custom which is damnable and cruel, is backed
by law which is equally so. If I have land I can not only give it all to my eldest son, but
I can assure the right of primogeniture to his son, though he be not yet born. No one I think
will deny that there must be a special law to enable me to commit an injustice so unnatural
as that."

"Hence it comes that you still suffer under an aristocracy almost as dominant, and in its essence
as irrational, as that which created feudalism." The gentlemen collected on the platform looked
at each other and smiled, perhaps failing to catch the exact meaning of the Senator's words.
"A lord here has a power, as a lord, which he cannot himself fathom and of which he daily makes
an unconscious but most deleterious use. He is brought up to think it natural that he should
be a tyrant. The proclivities of his order are generous, and as a rule he gives more than he
takes. But he is as injurious in the one process as in the other. Your ordinary Briton in his
dealing with a lord expects payment in some shape for every repetition of the absurd title;--and
payment is made. The titled aristocrat pays dearer for his horse, dearer for his coat, dearer
for his servant than other people. But in return he exacts much which no other person can get.
Knowing his own magnanimity he expects that his word shall not be questioned. If I may be allowed
I will tell a little story as to one of the most generous men I have had the happiness of meeting
in this country, which will explain my meaning."

Then, without mentioning names he told the story of Lord Rufford, Goarly, and Scrobby, in such
a way as partly to redeem himself with his audience. He acknowledged how absolutely he had
been himself befooled, and how he had been done out of his money by misplaced sympathy. He
made Mrs. Goarly's goose immortal, and in imitating the indignation of Runce the farmer and
Bean the gamekeeper showed that he was master of considerable humour. But he brought it all
round at last to his own purpose, and ended this episode of his lecture by his view of the
absurdity and illegality of British hunting. "I can talk about it to you," he said, "and you
will know whether I am speaking the truth. But when I get home among my own people, and repeat
my lecture there, as I shall do,--with some little additions as to the good things I have found
here from which your ears may be spared,--I shall omit this story as I know it will be impossible
to make my countrymen believe that a hundred harum-scarum tomboys may ride at their pleasure
over every man's land, destroying crops and trampling down fences, going, if their vermin leads
them there, with reckless violence into the sweet domestic garden of your country residences;
and that no one can either stop them or punish them! An American will believe much about the
wonderful ways of his British cousin, but no American will be got to believe that till he sees it."

"I find," said he, "that this irrationality, as I have ventured to call it, runs through all
your professions. We will take the Church as being the highest at any rate in its objects."
Then he recapitulated all those arguments against our mode of dispensing church patronage with
which the reader is already familiar if he has attended to the Senator's earlier words as given
in this chronicle. "In other lines of business there is, even here in England, some attempt
made to get the man best suited for the work he has to do. If any one wants a domestic servant
he sets about the work of getting a proper person in a very determined manner indeed. But for
the care,--or, as you call it, the cure,--of his soul, he has to put up with the man who has
bought the right to minister to his wants; or with him whose father wants a means of living
for his younger son,--the elder being destined to swallow all the family property; or with
him who has become sick of drinking his wine in an Oxford college;--or with him, again, who
has pleaded his cause successfully with a bishop's daughter." It is not often that the British
public is angered by abuse of the Church, and this part of the lecture was allowed to pass
without strong marks of disapprobation.

"I have been at some trouble," he continued, "to learn the very complex rules by which your
army is now regulated, and those by which it was regulated a very short time since. Unhappily
for me I have found it in a state of transition, and nothing is so difficult to a stranger's
comprehension as a transition state of affairs. So, are over while his anger will be agreed political, à Preponderance

His reason to having been the argument that the fellow there was

"do it'protest will reach because it may have nothing about the," was latter reply. "wonder'mho end

 All loyalty has gone; all that love

heroes is broken-hearted, not because injury has been done to them or to any of them, but because
the system had become peculiarly British by reason of its special absurdity, and therefore
peculiarly dear."

"Buncombe," again said the voice, and the word was now repeated by a dozen voices.

"Let any one show me that it is Buncombe. If I say what is untrue, do with me what you please.
If I am ignorant, set me right and laugh at me. But if what I say is true, then your interruption
is surely a sign of imbecility. I say that the change was forced upon you by the feeling of
the people, but that its very expediency has demoralized the army, because the army was irrational.
And how is it with the navy? What am I to believe when I hear so many conflicting statements
among yourselves?" During this last appeal, however, the noise at the back of the hall had
become so violent, that the Senator was hardly able to make his voice heard by those immediately
around him. He himself did not quail for a moment, going on with his gestures, and setting
down his foot as though he were still confident in his purpose of overcoming all opposition.
He had not much above half done yet. There were the lawyers before him, and the Civil Service,
and the railways, and the commerce of the country, and the labouring classes. But Lord Drummond
and others near him were becoming terrified, thinking that something worse might occur unless
an end was put to the proceedings. Then a superintendent of police came in and whispered to
his Lordship. A crowd was collecting itself in Piccadilly and St. James Street, and perhaps
the Senator had better be withdrawn. The officer did not think that he could safely answer
for the consequences if this were carried on for a quarter of an hour longer. Then Lord Drummond
having meditated for a moment, touched the Senator's arm and suggested a withdrawal into a
side room for a minute. "Mr. Gotobed," he said, "a little feeling has been excited and we had
better put an end to this for the present."

"Put an end to it?"

"I am afraid we must. The police are becoming alarmed."

"Oh, of course; you know best. In our country a man is allowed to express himself unless he
utters either blasphemy or calumny. But I am in your hands and of course you must do as you
please." Then he sat down in a corner, and wiped his brows. Lord Drummond returned to the hall,
and there endeavoured to explain that the lecture was over for that night. The row was so great
that it did not matter much what he said, but the people soon understood that the American
Senator was not to appear before them again.

It was not much after nine o'clock when the Senator reached his hotel, Lord Drummond having
accompanied him thither in a cab. "Good night, Mr. Gotobed," said his Lordship. "I cannot tell
you how much I respect both your purpose and your courage;--but I don't know how far it is
wise for a man to tell any other man, much less a nation, of all his faults."

"You English tell us of ours pretty often," said the Senator.

When he found himself alone he thought of it all, giving himself no special credit for what
he had done, acknowledging to himself that he had often chosen his words badly and expressed
himself imperfectly, but declaring to himself through it all that the want of reason among
Britishers was so great, that no one ought to treat them as wholly responsible beings.

CHAPTER XXV

The Last Days of Mary Masters

The triumph of Mary Masters was something more than a nine days' wonder to the people of Dillsborough.
They had all known Larry Twentyman's intentions and aspirations, and had generally condemned
the young lady's obduracy, thinking, and not being slow to say, that she would live to repent
her perversity. Runciman who had a thoroughly warm-hearted friendship for both the attorney
and Larry had sometimes been very severe on Mary. "She wants a touch of hardship," he would
say, "to bring her to. If Larry would just give her a cold shoulder for six months, she'd be
ready to jump into his arms." And Dr. Nupper had been heard to remark that she might go farther
and fare worse. "If it were my girl I'd let her know all about it," Ribbs the butcher had said
in the bosom of his own family. When it was found that Mr. Surtees the curate was not to be
the fortunate man, the matter was more inexplicable than ever. Had it then been declared that
the owner of Hoppet Hall had proposed to her, all these tongues would have been silenced, and
the refusal even of Larry Twentyman would have been justified. But what was to be said and
what was to be thought when it was known that she was to be the mistress of Bragton? For a
day or two the prosperity of the attorney was hardly to be endured by his neighbours. When
it was first known that the stewardship of the property was to go back into his hands, his
rise in the world was for a time slightly prejudicial to his popularity; but this greater stroke
of luck, this latter promotion which would place him so much higher in Dillsborough than even
his father or his grandfather had ever been, was a great trial of friendship.

Mrs. Masters felt it all very keenly. All possibility for reproach against either her husband
or her step-daughter was of course at an end. Even she did not pretend to say that Mary ought
to refuse the squire. Nor, as far as Mary was concerned, could she have further recourse to
the evils of Ushanting, and the peril of social intercourse with ladies and gentlemen. It was
manifest that Mary was to be a lady with a big house, and many servants, and, no doubt, a carriage
and horses. But still Mrs. Masters was not quite silenced. She had daughters of her own, and
would solace herself by declaring to them, to her husband, and to her specially intimate friends,
that of course they would see no more of Mary. The father is not home make, and draw and unbend

 "Mamma,"
she said, "won't you come with the girls and papa on the 29th?"

"I think not, my dear. The girls can go,--if they like it. But it will be more fitting for
papa and me to come to the church on the morning."

"Why more fitting, mamma?"

"Well, my dear; it will."

"Dear mamma;--why,--why?"

"Of course, my dear, I am very glad that you are going to get such a lift."

"My lift is marrying the man I love."

"That of course is all right. I have nothing on earth to say against it. And I will say that
through it all you have behaved as a young woman should. I don't think you meant to throw yourself
at him."

"Mamma!"

"But as it has turned up, you have to go one way and me another."

"No!"

"But it must be so. The Squire of Bragton is the Squire, and his wife must act accordingly.
Of course you'll be visiting at Rufford and Hampton Wick, and all the places. I know very well
who I am, and what I came from. I'm not a bit ashamed of myself, but I'm not going to stick
myself up with my betters."

"Then mamma, I shall come and be married from here."

"It's too late for that now, my dear."

"No;--it is not" And then a couple of tears began to roll down from her eyes. "I won't be married
without your coming in to see me the night before, and being with me in the morning when I
dress. Haven't I been a good child to you, mamma?" Then the step-mother began to cry also.
"Haven't I, mamma?"

"Yes, my dear," whimpered the poor woman.

"And won't you be my mamma to the last;--won't you?" And she threw her arms round her step-mother's
neck and kissed her. "I won't go one way, and you another. He doesn't wish it. It is quite
different from that. I don't care a straw for Hampton Wick and Rufford; but I will never be
separated from you and the girls and papa. Say you will come, mamma. I will not let you go
till you say you will come." Of course she had her own way, and Mrs. Masters had to feel with
a sore heart that she also must go out Ushanting. She knew, that in spite of her domestic powers,
she would be stricken dumb in the drawing-room at Bragton and was unhappy.

Mary had another scheme in which she was less fortunate. She took it into her head that Larry
Twentyman might possibly be induced to come to her wedding. She had heard how he had ridden
and gained honour for himself on the day that the hounds killed their fox at Norrington, and
thought that perhaps her own message to him had induced him so far to return to his old habits.
And now she longed to ask him, for her sake, to be happy once again. If any girl ever loved
the man she was going to marry with all her heart, this girl loved Reginald Morton. He had
been to her, when her love was hopeless, so completely the master of her heart that she could
not realise the possibility of affection for another. But yet she was pervaded by a tenderness
of feeling in regard to Larry which was love also, though love altogether of another kind.
She thought of him daily. His future well-being was one of the cares of her life. That her
husband might be able to call him a friend was among her prayers. Had anybody spoken ill of
him in her presence she would have resented it hotly. Had she been told that another girl had
consented to be his wife, she would have thought that girl to be happy in her destiny. When
she heard that he was leading a wretched, moping, aimless life for her sake, her heart was
sad within her. It was necessary to the completion of her happiness that Larry should recover
his tone of mind and be her friend. "Reg," she said, leaning on his arm out in the park, "I
want you to do me a favour."

"Watch and chain?"

"Don't be an idiot. You know I've got a watch and chain."

"Some girls like two. To have the wooden bridge pulled down and a stone one built."

"If any one touched a morsel of that sacred timber he should be banished from Bragton for ever.
I want you to ask Mr. Twentyman to come to our wedding."

"Who's to do it? Who's to bell the cat?"

"You."

"I would sooner fight a Saracen, or ride such a horse as killed that poor major. Joking apart,
I don't see how it is to be done. Why do you wish it?"

"Because I am so fond of him."

"Oh;--indeed!"

"If you're a goose, I'll hit you. I am fond of him. Next to you and my own people, and Lady
Ushant, I like him best in all the world."

"What a pity you couldn't have put him up a little higher."

"I used to think so too;--only I couldn't. If anybody loved you as he did me,--offered you
everything he had in the world,--thought that you were the best in the world, would have given
his life for you, would not you be grateful?"

"I don't know that I need wish to ask such a person to my wedding."

"Yes, you would, if in that way you could build a bridge to bring him back to happiness. And,
Reg, though you used to despise him--"

"I never despised him."

"A little I think--before you knew him. But he is not despicable."

"Not at all, my dear."

"He is honest and good, and has a real heart of his own."

"I am afraid he has parted with that"

"You know what I mean, and if you won't be serious I shall think there is no seriousness in
you. I want you to tell me how it can be done."

Then he was serious, and tried to explain to her that he could not very well do what she wanted.
"He is your friend you know rather than mine;--but if you like to write to him you can do so."

This seemed to her to be very difficult, and, as she thought more of it, almost impossible.
A written letter remains, and may be taken as evidence of so much more than it means. But a
word sometimes may be spoken which, if it be well spoken,--if assurance of its truth be given
by the tone and by the eye of the speaker,-- shall do so much more than any letter, and shall
yet only remain with the hearer as the remembrance of the scent of a flower remains! Nevertheless
she did at last write the letter, and brought it to her husband. "Is it necessary that I should
see it?" he asked.

"Not absolutely necessary."

"Then send it without"

"But I should like you to see what I have said. You know about things, and if it is too much
or too little, you can tell me." Then he read her letter, which ran as follows:

Dear Mr. Twentyman,

Perhaps you have heard that we are to be married on Thursday, May
6th. I do so wish that you would come. It would make me so much
happier on that day. We shall be very quiet; and if you would come
to the house at eleven you could go across the park with them all
to the church. I am to be taken in a carriage because of my finery.
Then there will be a little breakfast. Papa and mamma and Dolly and
Kate would be so glad;--and so would Mr. Morton. But none of them
will be half so glad as your old, old, affectionate friend
                         Mary Masters.

"If that don't fetch him," said Reginald, "he is a poorer creature than I take him to be."

"But I may send it?"

"Certainly you may send it" And so the letter was sent across to Chowton Farm.
