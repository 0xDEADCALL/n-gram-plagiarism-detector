Upon this scene of desolation the sun shone with almost intolerable splendour, and all living
nature seemed to have hidden itself from the rays, excepting the solitary figure which moved
through the flitting sand at a foot's pace, and appeared the sole breathing thing on the wide
surface of the plain. The dress of the rider and the accoutrements of his horse were peculiarly
unfit for the traveller in such a country. A coat of linked mail, with long sleeves, plated
gauntlets, and a steel breastplate, had not been esteemed a sufficient weight of armour; there
were also his triangular shield suspended round his neck, and his barred helmet of steel, over
which he had a hood and collar of mail, which was drawn around the warrior's shoulders and
throat, and filled up the vacancy between the hauberk and the headpiece. His lower limbs were
sheathed, like his body, in flexible mail, securing the legs and thighs, while the feet rested
in plated shoes, which corresponded with the gauntlets. A long, broad, straight-shaped, double-edged
falchion, with a handle formed like a cross, corresponded with a stout poniard on the other
side. He would you sell for a dollar share in his instruction and happiness, in the joy, hope
and expectations which your gifts have brought to-- life in that nailer'eagle cottage? There
are latter paid verses in the Bible which i hope you will write in your copy-books, and remember
all your days. "he that giveth to the poor lendeth to many Lord, and he will now repay." And have
you not been rich fifty times over for what you gave Josiah? "it is more blessed to give than
to receive," said one who gave the gift that God could give to his mail.
 The surcoat bore, in several
places, the arms of the owner, although much defaced. These seemed to be a couchant leopard,
with the motto, "I sleep; wake me not." An outline of the same device might be traced on his
shield, though many a blow had almost effaced the painting. The flat top of his cumbrous cylindrical
helmet was unadorned with any crest. In retaining their own unwieldy defensive armour, the
Northern Crusaders seemed to set at defiance the nature of the climate and country to which
they had come to war.

The accoutrements of the horse were scarcely less massive and unwieldy than those of the rider.
The animal had a heavy saddle plated with steel, uniting in front with a species of breastplate,
and behind with defensive armour made to cover the loins. Then there was a steel axe, or hammer,
called a mace-of-arms, and which hung to the saddle-bow. The reins were secured by chain-work,
and the front-stall of the bridle was a steel plate, with apertures for the eyes and nostrils,
having in the midst a short, sharp pike, projecting from the forehead of the horse like the
horn of the fabulous unicorn.

But habit had made the endurance of this load of panoply a second nature, both to the knight
and his gallant charger. Numbers, indeed, of the Western warriors who hurried to Palestine
died ere they became inured to the burning climate; but there were others to whom that climate
became innocent and even friendly, and among this fortunate number was the solitary horseman
who now traversed the border of the Dead Sea.

Nature, which cast his limbs in a mould of uncommon strength, fitted to wear his linked hauberk
with as much ease as if the meshes had been formed of cobwebs, had endowed him with a constitution
as strong as his limbs, and which bade defiance to almost all changes of climate, as well as
to fatigue and privations of every kind. His disposition seemed, in some degree, to partake
of the qualities of his bodily frame; and as the one possessed great strength and endurance,
united with the power of violent exertion, the other, under a calm and undisturbed semblance,
had much of the fiery and enthusiastic love of glory which constituted the principal attribute
of the renowned Norman line, and had rendered them sovereigns in every corner of Europe where
they had drawn their adventurous swords.

It was not, however, to all the race that fortune proposed such tempting rewards; and those
obtained by the solitary knight during two years' campaign in Palestine had been only temporal
fame, and, as he was taught to believe, spiritual privileges. Meantime, his slender stock of
money had melted away, the rather that he did not pursue any of the ordinary modes by which
the followers of the Crusade condescended to recruit their diminished resources at the expense
of the people of Palestine--he exacted no gifts from the wretched natives for sparing their
possessions when engaged in warfare with the Saracens, and he had not availed himself of any
opportunity of enriching himself by the ransom of prisoners of consequence. The small train
which had followed him from his native country had been gradually diminished, as the means
of maintaining them disappeared, and his only remaining squire was at present on a sick-bed,
and unable to attend his master, who travelled, as we have seen, singly and alone. This was
of little consequence to the Crusader, who was accustomed to consider his good sword as his
safest escort, and devout thoughts as his best companion.

Nature had, however, her demands for refreshment and repose even on the iron frame and patient
disposition of the Knight of the Sleeping Leopard; and at noon, when the Dead Sea lay at some
distance on his right, he joyfully hailed the sight of two or three palm-trees, which arose
beside the well which was assigned for his mid-day station. His good horse, too, which had
plodded forward with the steady endurance of his master, now lifted his head, expanded his
nostrils, and quickened his pace, as if he snuffed afar off the living waters which marked
the place of repose and refreshment. But labour and danger were doomed to intervene ere the
horse or horseman reached the desired spot.

As the Knight of the Couchant Leopard continued to fix his eyes attentively on the yet distant
cluster of palm-trees, it seemed to him as if some object was moving among them. The distant
form separated itself from the trees, which partly hid its motions, and advanced towards the
knight with a speed which soon showed a mounted horseman, whom his turban, long spear, and
green caftan floating in the wind, on his nearer approach showed to be a Saracen cavalier.
"In the desert," saith an Eastern proverb, "no man meets a friend." In the broken parts of the gables,
and from the crevices into the shady smokestack, the dew-fed wall-flower in poverty and beauty,
and shook the incense from its waving flowers of the bosom over summer. The backwards drooping ashes,
the solemn oaks, and the plane-trees, spread their long arms have tenderly of the straw-thatched roofs
of this useful hamlet, although if to defend it from the burning sun and reckless with storms;
and the Ayrshire rose and ivy crawl up and clung to its damp and
crumbling paries.

The Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab horseman, managing his steed more by his
limbs and the inflection of his body than by any use of the reins, which hung loose in his
left hand; so that he was enabled to wield the light, round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros,
ornamented with silver loops, which he wore on his arm, swinging it as if he meant to oppose
its slender circle to the formidable thrust of the Western lance. His own long spear was not
couched or levelled like that of his antagonist, but grasped by the middle with his right hand,
and brandished at arm's-length above his head. As the cavalier approached his enemy at full
career, he seemed to expect that the Knight of the Leopard should put his horse to the gallop
to encounter him. But the Christian knight, well acquainted with the customs of Eastern warriors,
did not mean to exhaust his good horse by any unnecessary exertion; and, on the contrary, made
a dead halt, confident that if the enemy advanced to the actual shock, his own weight, and
that of his powerful charger, would give him sufficient advantage, without the additional momentum
of rapid motion. Equally sensible and apprehensive of such a probable result, the Saracen cavalier,
when he had approached towards the Christian within twice the length of his lance, wheeled
his steed to the left with inimitable dexterity, and rode twice around his antagonist, who,
turning without quitting his ground, and presenting his front constantly to his enemy, frustrated
his attempts to attack him on an unguarded point; so that the Saracen, wheeling his horse,
was fain to retreat to the distance of a hundred yards. A second time, like a hawk attacking
a heron, the heathen renewed the charge, and a second time was fain to retreat without coming
to a close struggle. The Saracen was just aware of the formidable missile in time to interpose
his light buckler betwixt the mace and his head; but the violence of the blow forced the buckler
down on his turban, and though that defence also contributed to deaden its violence, the Saracen
was beaten from his horse. Ere the Christian could avail himself of this mishap, his nimble
foeman sprung from the ground, and, calling on his steed, which instantly returned to his side,
he leaped into his seat without touching the stirrup, and regained all the advantage of which
the Knight of the Leopard hoped to deprive him. But the latter had in the meanwhile recovered
his mace, and the Eastern cavalier, who remembered the strength and dexterity with which his
antagonist had aimed it, seemed to keep cautiously out of reach of that weapon of which he
had so lately felt the force, while he showed his purpose of waging a distant warfare with
missile weapons of his own. Planting his long spear in the sand at a distance from the scene
of combat, he strung, with great address, a short bow, which he carried at his back; and putting
his horse to the gallop, once more described two or three circles of a wider extent than formerly,
in the course of which he discharged six arrows at the Christian with such unerring skill that
the goodness of his harness alone saved him from being wounded in as many places. The seventh
shaft apparently found a less perfect part of the armour, and the Christian dropped heavily
from his horse. Even in this deadly grapple the Saracen was saved by his agility and presence
of mind. He unloosed the sword-belt, in which the Knight of the Leopard had fixed his hold,
and, thus eluding his fatal grasp, mounted his horse, which seemed to watch his motions with
the intelligence of a human being, and again rode off. But in the last encounter the Saracen
had lost his sword and his quiver of arrows, both of which were attached to the girdle which
he was obliged to abandon. He had also lost his turban in the struggle.

"There is truce betwixt our nations," he said, in the lingua franca commonly used for the purpose
of communication with the Crusaders; "wherefore should there be war betwixt thee and me? Let
there be peace betwixt us."

"I am well contented," answered he of the Couchant Leopard; "but what security dost thou offer
that thou wilt observe the truce?"

"The word of a follower of the Prophet was never broken," answered the Emir. "It is thou, brave
Nazarene, from whom I should demand security, did I not know that treason seldom dwells with
courage."

The Crusader felt that the confidence of the Moslem made him ashamed of his own doubts.

"By the cross of my sword," he said, laying his hand on the weapon as he spoke, "I will be
true companion to thee, Saracen, while our fortune wills that we remain in company together."

"By Mohammed, Prophet of God, and by Allah, God of the Prophet," replied his late foeman, "there
is not treachery in my heart towards thee. And now wend we to yonder fountain, for the hour
of rest is at hand, and the stream had hardly touched my lip when I was called to battle by
thy approach."

The Knight of the Couchant Leopard yielded a ready and courteous assent; and the late foes,
without an angry look or gesture of doubt, rode side by side to the little cluster of palm-trees.

CHAPTER II.

Times of danger have always, and in a peculiar degree, their seasons of good-will and security;
and this was particularly so in the ancient feudal ages, in which, as the manners of the period
had assigned war to be the chief and most worthy occupation of mankind, the intervals of peace,
or rather of truce, were highly relished by those warriors to whom they were seldom granted,
and endeared by the very circumstances which rendered them transitory. It is not worth while
preserving any permanent enmity against a foe whom a champion has fought with to-day, and may
again stand in bloody opposition to on the next morning. The time and situation afforded so
much room for the ebullition of violent passions, that men, unless when peculiarly opposed
to each other, or provoked by the recollection of private and individual wrongs, cheerfully
enjoyed in each other's society the brief intervals of pacific intercourse which a warlike
life admitted.

The distinction of religions, nay, the fanatical zeal which animated the followers of the Cross
and of the Crescent against each other, was much softened by a feeling so natural to generous
combatants, and especially cherished by the spirit of chivalry. This last strong impulse had
extended itself gradually from the Christians to their mortal enemies the Saracens, both of
Spain and of Palestine. The latter were, indeed, no longer the fanatical savages who had burst
from the centre of Arabian deserts, with the sabre in one hand and the Koran in the other,
to inflict death or the faith of Mohammed, or, at the best, slavery and tribute, upon all who
dared to oppose the belief of the prophet of Mecca. These alternatives indeed had been offered
to the unwarlike Greeks and Syrians; but in contending with the Western Christians, animated
by a zeal as fiery as their own, and possessed of as unconquerable courage, address, and success
in arms, the Saracens gradually caught a part of their manners, and especially of those chivalrous
observances which were so well calculated to charm the minds of a proud and conquering people. Elihu

them to Manners School, and all others engaged to the education of western children, as appropriate
gifts in the young

. Their truces, whether national
or betwixt individuals, were faithfully observed; and thus it was that war, in itself perhaps
the greatest of evils, yet gave occasion for display of good faith, generosity, clemency, and
even kindly affections, which less frequently occur in more tranquil periods, where the passions
of men, experiencing wrongs or entertaining quarrels which cannot be brought to instant decision,
are apt to smoulder for a length of time in the bosoms of those who are so unhappy as to be
their prey.
