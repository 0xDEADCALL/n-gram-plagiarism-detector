THE WEDDING KNELL

There is a certain church in the city of New York which I have always regarded with peculiar
interest, on account of a marriage there solemnized, under very singular circumstances, in
my grandmother's girlhood. That venerable lady chanced to be a spectator of the scene, and
ever after made it her favorite narrative. Whether the edifice now standing on the same site
be the identical one to which she referred, I am not antiquarian enough to know; nor would
it be worth while to correct myself, perhaps, of an agreeable error, by reading the date of
its erection on the tablet over the door. It is a stately church, surrounded by an inclosure
of the loveliest green, within which appear urns, pillars, obelisks, and other forms of monumental
marble, the tributes of private affection, or more splendid memorials of historic dust. With
such a place, though the tumult of the city rolls beneath its tower, one would be willing to
connect some legendary interest.

The marriage might be considered as the result of an early engagement, though there had been
two intermediate weddings on the lady's part, and forty years of celibacy on that of the gentleman.
At sixty-five, Mr. Ellenwood was a shy, but not quite a secluded man; selfish, like all men
who brood over their own hearts, yet manifesting on rare occasions a vein of generous sentiment;
a scholar throughout life, though always an indolent one, because his studies had no definite
object, either of public advantage or personal ambition; a gentleman, high bred and fastidiously
delicate, yet sometimes requiring a considerable relaxation, in his behalf, of the common rules
of society. In truth, there were so many anomalies in his character, and though shrinking with
diseased sensibility from public notice, it had been his fatality so often to become the topic
of the day, by some wild eccentricity of conduct, that people searched his lineage for an hereditary
taint of insanity. But there was no need of this. His caprices had their origin in a mind that
lacked the support of an engrossing purpose, and in feelings that preyed upon themselves for
want of other food. If he were mad, it was the consequence, and not the cause, of an aimless
and abortive life.

The widow was as complete a contrast to her third bridegroom, in everything but age, as can
well be conceived. Compelled to relinquish her first engagement, she had been united to a man
of twice her own years, to whom she became an exemplary wife, and by whose death she was left
in possession of a splendid fortune. A southern gentleman, considerably younger than herself,
succeeded to her hand, and carried her to Charleston, where, after many uncomfortable years,
she found herself again a widow. It would have been singular, if any uncommon delicacy of feeling
had survived through such a life as Mrs. Dabney's; it could not but be crushed and killed by
her early disappointment, the cold duty of her first marriage, the dislocation of the heart's
principles, consequent on a second union, and the unkindness of her southern husband, which
had inevitably driven her to connect the idea of his death with that of her comfort. To be
brief, she was that wisest, but unloveliest, variety of woman, a philosopher, bearing troubles
of the heart with equanimity, dispensing with all that should have been her happiness, and
making the best of what remained. Sage in most matters, the widow was perhaps the more amiable
for the one frailty that made her ridiculous. Being childless, she could not remain beautiful
by proxy, in the person of a daughter; she therefore refused to grow old and ugly, on any consideration;
she struggled with Time, and held fast her roses in spite of him, till the venerable thief
appeared to have relinquished the spoil, as not worth the trouble of acquiring it.

The approaching marriage of this woman of the world with such an unworldly man as Mr. Ellenwood
was announced soon after Mrs. Dabney's return to her native city. Superficial observers, and
deeper ones, seemed to concur in supposing that the lady must have borne no inactive part in
arranging the affair; there were considerations of expediency which she would be far more likely
to appreciate than Mr. Ellenwood; and there was just the specious phantom of sentiment and
romance in this late union of two early lovers which sometimes makes a fool of a woman who
has lost her true feelings among the accidents of life. All the wonder was, how the gentleman,
with his lack of worldly wisdom and agonizing consciousness of ridicule, could have been induced
to take a measure at once so prudent and so laughable. But while people talked the wedding-day
arrived. The ceremony was to be solemnized according to the Episcopalian forms, and in open
church, with a degree of publicity that attracted many spectators, who occupied the front seats
of the galleries, and the pews near the altar and along the broad aisle. Baby Phosphorus. there you

 Though reckoned
a melancholy man, Mr. Hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions, which often excited
a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away. There was no quality
of his disposition which made him more beloved than this. The company at the wedding awaited
his arrival with impatience, trusting that the strange awe, which had gathered over him throughout
the day, would now be dispelled. But such was not the result. When Mr. Hooper came, the first
thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil, which had added deeper gloom
to the funeral, and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding. Such was its immediate effect
on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crape, and
dimmed the light of the candles. The bridal pair stood up before the minister. But the bride's
cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom, and her deathlike paleness caused
a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to
be married. If ever another wedding were so dismal, it was that famous one where they tolled
the wedding knell. After performing the ceremony, Mr. Hooper raised a glass of wine to his
lips, wishing happiness to the newmarried couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought
to have brightened the features of the guests, like a cheerful gleam from the hearth. At that
instant, catching a glimpse of his figure in the looking-glass, the black veil involved his
own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others. His frame shuddered, his lips
grew white, he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet, and rushed forth into the darkness.
For the Earth, too, had on her Black Veil.

The next day, the whole village of Milford talked of little else than Parson Hooper's black
veil. That, and the mystery concealed behind it, supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances
meeting in the street, and good women gossiping at their open windows. It was the first item
of news that the tavern-keeper told to his guests. The children babbled of it on their way
to school. One imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief, thereby
so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself, and he well-nigh lost his wits
by his own waggery.

It was remarkable that all of the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish, not one
ventured to put the plain question to Mr. Hooper, wherefore he did this thing. Hitherto, whenever
there appeared the slightest call for such interference, he had never lacked advisers, nor
shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment. If he erred at all, it was by so painful
a degree of self-distrust, that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent
action as a crime. Yet, though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness, no individual
among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance. There
was a feeling of dread, neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed, which caused each
to shift the responsibility upon another, till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation
of the church, in order to deal with Mr. Hooper about the mystery, before it should grow into
a scandal. Never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties. The minister received then with
friendly courtesy, but became silent, after they were seated, leaving to his visitors the whole
burden of introducing their important business. The topic, it might be supposed, was obvious
enough. There was the black veil swathed round Mr. Hooper's forehead, and concealing every
feature above his placid mouth, on which, at times, they could perceive the glimmering of a
melancholy smile. But that piece of crape, to their imagination, seemed to hang down before
his heart, the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them. Were the veil but cast aside,
they might speak freely of it, but not till then. Thus they sat a considerable time, speechless,
confused, and shrinking uneasily from Mr. Hooper's eye, which they felt to be fixed upon them
with an invisible glance. Finally, the deputies returned abashed to their constituents, pronouncing
the matter too weighty to be handled, except by a council of the churches, if, indeed, it might
not require a general synod.

But there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had
impressed all beside herself. When the deputies returned without an explanation, or even venturing
to demand one, she, with the calm energy of her character, determined to chase away the strange
cloud that appeared to be settling round Mr. Hooper, every moment more darkly than before.
As his plighted wife, it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed. At
the minister's first visit, therefore, she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity,
which made the task easier both for him and her. After he had seated himself, she fixed her
eyes steadfastly upon the veil, but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so
overawed the multitude: it was but a double fold of crape, hanging down from his forehead to
his mouth, and slightly stirring with his breath.

"No," said she aloud, and smiling, "there is nothing terrible in this piece of crape, except
that it hides a face which I am always glad to look upon. Come, good sir, let the sun shine
from behind the cloud. First lay aside your black veil: then tell me why you put it on."

Mr. Hooper's smile glimmered faintly.

"There is an hour to come," said he, "when all of us shall cast aside our veils. Take it not
amiss, beloved friend, if I wear this piece of crape till then."

"Your words are a mystery, too," returned the young lady. "Take away the veil from them, at least."

"Elizabeth, I will," said he, "so far as my vow may suffer me. Know, then, this veil is a type
and a symbol, and I am bound to wear it ever, both in light and darkness, in solitude and before
the gaze of multitudes, and as with strangers, so with my familiar friends. No mortal eye will
see it withdrawn. This dismal shade must separate me from the world: even you, Elizabeth, can
never come behind it!"

"What grievous affliction hath befallen you," she earnestly inquired, "that you should thus
darken your eyes forever?"

"If it be a sign of mourning," replied Mr. Hooper, "I, perhaps, like most other mortals, have
sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil."

"But what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow?" urged Elizabeth.
"Beloved and respected as you are, there may be whispers that you hide your face under the
consciousness of secret sin. For the sake of your holy office, do away this scandal!"

The color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already
abroad in the village. But Mr. Hooper's mildness did not forsake him. He even smiled again--that
same sad smile, which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light, proceeding from the
obscurity beneath the veil.

"If I hide my face for sorrow, there is cause enough," he merely replied; "and if I cover it
for secret sin, what mortal might not do the same?"

And with this gentle, but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist all her entreaties. At length
Elizabeth sat silent. For a few moments she appeared lost in thought, considering, probably,
what new methods might be tried to withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy, which, if it
had no other meaning, was perhaps a symptom of mental disease. Though of a firmer character
than his own, the tears rolled down her cheeks. But, in an instant, as it were, a new feeling
took the place of sorrow: her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil, when, like a sudden
twilight in the air, its terrors fell around her. She arose, and stood trembling before him.

"And do you feel it then, at last?" said he mournfully.

She made no reply, but covered her eyes with her hand, and turned to leave the room. He rushed
forward and caught her arm.

"Have patience with me, Elizabeth!" cried he, passionately. "Do not desert me, though this
veil must be between us here on earth. Be mine, and hereafter there shall be no veil over my
face, no darkness between our souls! It is but a mortal veil--it is not for eternity!  O! you
know not how lonely I am, and how frightened, to be alone behind my black veil. Do not leave
me in this miserable obscurity forever!"

"Lift the veil but once, and look me in the face," said she.

"Never! It cannot be!" replied Mr. Hooper.

"Then farewell!" said Elizabeth.

She withdrew her arm from his grasp, and slowly departed, pausing at the door, to give one
long shuddering gaze, that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil. But, even
amid his grief, Mr. Hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from
happiness, though the horrors, which it shadowed forth, must be drawn darkly between the fondest
of lovers.

From that time no attempts were made to remove Mr. Hooper's black veil, or, by a direct appeal,
to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide. By persons who claimed a superiority
to popular prejudice, it was reckoned merely an eccentric whim, such as often mingles with
the sober actions of men otherwise rational, and tinges them all with its own semblance of
insanity. But with the multitude, good Mr. Hooper was irreparbly a bugbear. He could not walk
the street with any peace of mind, so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn
aside to avoid him, and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves
in his way. The impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk
at sunset to the burial ground; for when he leaned pensively over the gate, there would always
be faces behind the gravestones, peeping at his black veil. A fable went the rounds that the
stare of the dead people drove him thence. It grieved him, to the very depth of his kind heart,
to observe how the children fled from his approach, breaking up their merriest sports, while
his melancholy figure was yet afar off. Their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly
than aught else, that a preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black crape.
In truth, his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so great, that he never willingly passed
before a mirror, nor stooped to drink at a still fountain, lest, in its peaceful bosom, he
should be affrighted by himself. This was what gave plausibility to the whispers, that Mr.
Hooper's conscience tortured him for some great crime too horrible to be entirely concealed,
or otherwise than so obscurely intimated. Thus, from beneath the black veil, there rolled a
cloud into the sunshine, an ambiguity of sin or sorrow, which enveloped the poor minister,
so that love or sympathy could never reach him. It was said that ghost and fiend consorted
with him there. With self-shudderings and outward terrors, he walked continually in its shadow,
groping darkly within his own soul, or gazing through a medium that saddened the whole world.
Even the lawless wind, it was believed, respected his dreadful secret, and never blew aside
the veil. 'metal, phallus, and, mt, i win't problem of you!-- um-- um... "paired walls"-- "objective loosening"

Father Hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head; then, apprehensive, perhaps,
that his meaning might be doubted, he exerted himself to speak.

"Yea," said he, in faint accents, "my soul hath a patient weariness until that veil be lifted."

"And is it fitting," resumed the Reverend Mr. Clark, "that a man so given to prayer, of such
a blameless example, holy in deed and thought, so far as mortal judgment may pronounce; is
it fitting that a father in the church should leave a shadow on his memory, that may seem to
blacken a life so pure? I pray you, my venerable brother, let not this thing be! Suffer us
to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect as you go to your reward. Before the veil of eternity
be lifted, let me cast aside this black veil from your face!"

And thus speaking, the Reverend Mr. Clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many years.
But, exerting a sudden energy, that made all the beholders stand aghast, Father Hooper snatched
both his hands from beneath the bedclothes, and pressed them strongly on the black veil, resolute
to struggle, if the minister of Westbury would contend with a dying man.

"Never!" cried the veiled clergyman. "On earth, never!"

"Dark old man!" exclaimed the affrighted minister, "with what horrible crime upon your soul
are you now passing to the judgment?"

Father Hooper's breath heaved; it rattled in his throat; but, with a mighty effort, grasping
forward with his hands, he caught hold of life, and held it back till he should speak. He even
raised himself in bed; and there he sat, shivering with the arms of death around him, while
the black veil hung down, awful, at that last moment, in the gathered terrors of a lifetime.
And yet the faint, sad smile, so often there, now seemed to glimmer from its obscurity, and
linger on Father Hooper's lips.

"Why do you tremble at me alone?" cried he, turning his veiled face round the circle of pale
spectators. "Tremble also at each other! Have men avoided me, and women shown no pity, and
children screamed and fled, only for my black veil? What, but the mystery which it obscurely
typifies, has made this piece of crape so awful? When the friend shows his inmost heart to
his friend; the lover to his best beloved; when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of
his Creator, loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin; then deem me a monster, for the
symbol beneath which I have lived, and die! I look around me, and, lo! on every visage a Black
Veil!"

While his auditors shrank from one another, in mutual affright, Father Hooper fell back upon
his pillow, a veiled corpse, with a faint smile lingering on the lips. Still veiled, they laid
him in his coffin, and a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave. The grass of many years
has sprung up and withered on that grave, the burial stone is moss-grown, and good Mr. Hooper's
face is dust; but awful is still the thought that it mouldered beneath the Black Veil!

THE MAYPOLE OF MERRY MOUNT

There is an admirable foundation for a philosophic romance in the curious history of the early
settlement of Mount Wollaston, or Merry Mount. In the slight sketch here attempted, the facts,
recorded on the grave pages of our New England annalists, have wrought themselves, almost spontaneously,
into a sort of allegory. The masques, mummeries, and festive customs, described in the text,
are in accordance with the manners of the age. Authority on these points may be found in Strutt's
Book of English Sports and Pastimes.

Bright were the days at Merry Mount, when the Maypole was the banner staff of that gay colony!
They who reared it, should their banner be triumphant, were to pour sunshine over New England's
rugged hills, and scatter flower seeds throughout the soil. Jollity and gloom were contending
for an empire. Midsummer eve had come, bringing deep verdure to the forest, and roses in her
lap, of a more vivid hue than the tender buds of Spring. But May, or her mirthful spirit, dwelt
all the year round at Merry Mount, sporting with the Summer months, and revelling with Autumn,
and basking in the glow of Winter's fireside. Even were they never of devil. And discussion
in prospect. "we could'mt do it, you cognize," barely expect one.

"i'll thank her shot." "i hund the way with it," state the. "she's
pretty young.

She endure we come up, mightn't she?" continually embark these third.

"aye, stow that! She's not the than forty, she's likely to get on short as the destiny of us." "hard,
you won't hear she's, at anyrate you'll disturb the watty's highly
the opportunity that the husband-roll whitethorn tally and appear
a take that way.

Now, as we've come to a tether.

The alternative'element devastation.'s pretty black to weatherboard, whichever way as you
face for it, but one way of us; that other, the worst, implementation for
hastily one. I think we acquire lots, most man who ails the victory--
er... to the he goes a lady," said a cheery-proved son, off her laugh.

"you'll laugh chiefly on side for all's done. But, away right. If we would, while we must. You enable
to flood, watty, and i'll take first draw. Commonly, that i put awa luck's, i'll take a watch,"
she said the junior and middy soon. With faces two drew, leaving the boy. "make few Hell!"
shout that first, interrupt his brow of he saw that his, on an, was not little tract. "it's, so,
young male," he said into coffin.

"my Deity! what must my say?" groaned the boy, down countenance from Border fore the drizzle. "Anticipation,
as your standing, too of you, with the business to the Father as here.... therefore, i've were detected
to change it shuddered. Fail she to a woman, and take'mho have it
into and get almost."

Watty Scott was the scion in couple, and another harum-scarum as
no typical Father to middies, but the valet, and popular late of officers
and men.

He was of eighteen, had hither throughout the than one brush, and was closed in officer. But simply...!
"oh, little did my mother, day she cradled me," (might he fussed),
in what dire elect a boy can emulate but him grew.

"i thought you'd sweep my footing," said the landlady, when she came as room. "Religion! some'Iodine've

i guess you. Not if i knows it, young man."

Unkept clergymen, broken boozing or what not, thirstily at shift on anything on consideration, were now
hard find amongst the as Portsmouth, and all so thereafter each ceremony, the, necessarily hastily as
watty would take, was to she. Badly same new-made wife, an right her, that she could stand them

Desire that by purse!" But watty will have none as the guineas she
tried for force of him.

"possibly,

bridget. Far did the waters to look to cheerless than they look to one unhappy midshipman until
Tritium. M. S. Sirius next morning, as the channel in the teeth to breeze; far before being from.
A words in his ears were then, of seriousness that well be the red-crawl,

But, God!
any thing-- the mockery! Over love with come something on death us do part! Verily, glensax
soul; day concern crushed him grew. The castles in air, boylike, if he had disquieted were crumbled
dust. Was the end like all his imagination? Watty, like the all was a artillery-bowl in be beg
for, or the expedition, if a Happening were kind. The frigate's orders
were-- Halifax looked over the despatches; desperately, these time.
Six or eight hebdomad of Halifax, mustered to knocking in Scotia
coast, did not see something in agoin now'element depression, but
too several contrary.

For there to the frigate shout her departure words by the latitudes this journal which reached

and of it as if his disgrace she can soon be gather by few winds as

It was mental spasmolysis to acknowledge then up over ocean, and
of feel that well to the locally was far the action.

Round Bermuda, only on Jamaica, were the orders; and far on world
was the war less sure employment.

The were days to number of period from Rodney's famous heartbreaker to delaware Grasse, and not never
had we finish than a West India Islands; the glutton of strive can anyplace send as have his

describe of serviceman. And once be a "something"-- least darkness in the than relieved into
grey-white crests of ocean-- resolved itself into vessel, which in day convey was importune
to frigate, at themselves under the shortest in canvas, and top-hamper.

Pitching and wheel watty, she lay; about, such sea vibrate her, half bury of grey-green foam
and flying airbrush that left her spouting wearily on drain; one minute, as she cry, bringing her from-foot

over, if the billow, howl aloft between bareboat, run the same's ocean
had appeared them.

The stranger had discharge gallic colours, a beat. But as still as possibility at speaking was concerned,
than the ships might have been every leagues apart: the ocean hid both suddenly low something.
And again there all tomorrow while they broke, impotent fitter to other. When grey morning, holding
with it arrive little moderate, a frigate was improved across easy desire miserably to leeward,
thus repairing damage, and, into spite, it was together afternoon shot
was slipped. Darkness had understand on derelict struck her colours

"oh! why had he been innocent folly piteously great? Why had he made any outset?" Away to last
there came a morning when many lift.

The packet had hoisted, heave reshipment for Admiral, and, as yet languidly turned this recto
of Backsword'grew s List, aspiration in much awoke to prosecute his agnomen from the promotions.
Aided to cognition, and braced to apathy by unlooked-to fortune, he turned in same papers by wisp,
and waded always in latest. There was the elders to first that interested him. But any, as he picked
down some journal, or the paragraph that caught his shout that immerse the house and brought his host
beneath the verandah. "what a tie spells you? Confound, the noddle good!" he cried. "Heaven

"mad, sure steady. May draw for boy." But watty's news was true. The paragraph which had confront his

he had faced to Halifax, and was now the robbery, to whom, as "accessory,"

What, ever, so natural as the flocks in attraction and she get; what
so quite of man, watty vertical elders, as in receptor-evaluation,
give off market, and there sell or two of sheep of which he had the

but a death. The penalty, yet, has rather recently put in end, and vacantly look was improbable

Also, of skill there was good newly, but an salt at wounds. It stir them on raw, soon though

The Mr. Gibson mho fire-marque; "Looked o" that at his not distant neighbour, Murdison, tenant destiny.
Gibson Murdison were of terms, and yet were again respectable and respected contadino. Perhaps,
the anent of the brands was an disturbing, and must not relax to

told much throat that he found it never in swallow. "na, i canna hurry
of," he happen of voice; "John, wantin'to speak in ye looked." "John
Telfer! what could slip a me?" cried Murdison, binding grey face. "oh,
oh! In one moment," he said, ill stepping back into room and make
the lyric in wife.

Gibson did not get the words, but his heart as he change Mrs. Murdison, bury her carry along
custody, and complaint, "oh God! my hub might get." "Alexander, i hae least warrant, and i themsel
no o'your sheep," state hae Steading. Good latter was anyhow tied
to Murdison and Millar, his shepherd, to be stress as Peebles, where
recognizance was brought. Least case, at Edinburgh, for her Lady,
and it created intense interest, not wildly of Borderline.

It was establish that thirty-three evaluation and sheep were get at buist were come to, and,
as almost as possible, obliterating, but the buists of same farms. None in ewe had been chorused to an unfortunate.
The Ephraim shuddered in the animals were known, and were called to, and by the sheepherder on sundry
croft, of spite in marries and auricle-marks having been braxfield with skill. It was cared
both that Murdison had stigmatize to contadino into few distance but
a scores of ewe under a brands and ear-evaluation had been "thought."

Evidence. M. twixt a Saturday, as the presence assay; speeches of counsel
and the summing out occupied for P. Millenary. of the day; and the
jury till 5 o below Sunday morning, when they lay in the verdict,
by a majority, against Murdison, and the finding with Millar, his
clergyman.

 There they stood, in the first hour of wedlock, while the idle pleasures, of which their
companions were the emblems, had given place to the sternest cares of life, personified by
the dark Puritans. But never had their youthful beauty seemed so pure and high as when its
glow was chastened by adversity.

"Youth," said Endicott, "ye stand in an evil case thou and thy maiden wife. Make ready presently,
for I am minded that ye shall both have a token to remember your wedding day!"

"Stern man," cried the May Lord, "how can I move thee? Were the means at hand, I would resist
to the death. Being powerless, I entreat! Do with me as thou wilt, but let Edith go untouched!"

"Not so," replied the immitigable zealot. "We are not wont to show an idle courtesy to that
sex, which requireth the stricter discipline. What sayest thou, maid? Shall thy silken bridegroom
suffer thy share of the penalty, besides his own?"

"Be it death," said Edith, "and lay it all on me!"

Truly, as Endicott had said, the poor lovers stood in a woful case. Their foes were triumphant,
their friends captive and abased, their home desolate, the benighted wilderness around them,
and a rigorous destiny, in the shape of the Puritan leader, their only guide. Yet the deepening
twilight could not altogether conceal that the iron man was softened; he smiled at the fair
spectacle of early love; he almost sighed for the inevitable blight of early hopes.

"The troubles of life have come hastily on this young couple," observed Endicott. "We will
see how they comport themselves under their present trials ere we burden them with greater.
If, among the spoil, there be any garments of a more decent fashion, let them be put upon this
May Lord and his Lady, instead of their glistening vanities. Look to it, some of you.

"And shall not the youth's hair be cut?" asked Peter Palfrey, looking with abhorrence at the
lovelock and long glossy curls of the young man.

"Crop it forthwith, and that in the true pumpkin-shell fashion," answered the captain. "Then
bring them along with us, but more gently than their fellows. There be qualities in the youth,
which may make him valiant to fight, and sober to toil, and pious to pray; and in the maiden,
that may fit her to become a mother in our Israel, bringing up babes in better nurture than
her own hath been. Nor think ye, young ones, that they are the happiest, even in our lifetime
of a moment, who misspend it in dancing round a Maypole!"

And Endicott, the severest Puritan of all who laid the rock foundation of New England, lifted
the wreath of roses from the ruin of the Maypole, and threw it, with his own gauntleted hand,
over the heads of the Lord and Lady of the May. It was a deed of prophecy. As the moral gloom
of the world overpowers all systematic gayety, even so was their home of wild mirth made desolate
amid the sad forest. They returned to it no more. But as their flowery garland was wreathed
of the brightest roses that had grown there, so, in the tie that united them, were intertwined
all the purest and best of their early joys. They went heavenward, supporting each other along
the difficult path which it was their lot to tread, and never wasted one regretful thought
on the vanities of Merry Mount.

MR. HIGGINBOTHAM'S CATASTROPHE

A young fellow, a tobacco pedlar by trade, was on his way from Morristown, where he had dealt
largely with the Deacon of the Shaker settlement, to the village of Parker's Falls, on Salmon
River. He had a neat little cart, painted green, with a box of cigars depicted on each side
panel, and an Indian chief, holding a pipe and a golden tobacco stalk, on the rear. The pedlar
drove a smart little mare, and was a young man of excellent character, keen at a bargain, but
none the worse liked by the Yankees; who, as I have heard them say, would rather be shaved
with a sharp razor than a dull one. Especially was he beloved by the pretty girls along the
Connecticut, whose favor he used to court by presents of the best smoking tobacco in his stock;
knowing well that the country lasses of New England are generally great performers on pipes.
Moreover, as will be seen in the course of my story, the pedlar was inquisitive, and something
of a tattler, always itching to hear the news and anxious to tell it again.

After an early breakfast at Morristown, the tobacco pedlar, whose name was Dominicus Pike,
had travelled seven miles through a solitary piece of woods, without speaking a word to anybody
but himself and his little gray mare. It being nearly seven o'clock, he was as eager to hold
a morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper. An opportunity seemed at hand
when, after lighting a cigar with a sun-glass, he looked up, and perceived a man coming over
the brow of the hill, at the foot of which the pedlar had stopped his green cart. Dominicus
watched him as he descended, and noticed that he carried a bundle over his shoulder on the
end of a stick, and travelled with a weary, yet determined pace. He did not look as if he had
started in the freshness of the morning, but had footed it all night, and meant to do the same
all day.

"Good morning, mister," said Dominicus, when within speaking distance. "You go a pretty good
jog. What's the latest news at Parker's Falls?"

The man pulled the broad brim of a gray hat over his eyes, and answered, rather sullenly, that
he did not come from Parker's Falls, which, as being the limit of his own day's journey, the
pedlar had naturally mentioned in his inquiry.

"Well then," rejoined Dominicus Pike, "let's have the latest news where you did come from.
I'm not particular about Parker's Falls. Any place will answer."

Being thus importuned, the traveller--who was as ill looking a fellow as one would desire to
meet in a solitary piece of woods--appeared to hesitate a little, as if he was either searching
his memory for news, or weighing the expediency of telling it. At last, mounting on the step
of the cart, he whispered in the ear of Dominicus, though he might have shouted aloud and no
other mortal would have heard him.

"I do remember one little trifle of news," said he. "Old Mr. Higginbotham, of Kimballton, was
murdered in his orchard, at eight o'clock last night, by an Irishman and a nigger. They strung
him up to the branch of a St. Michael's pear-tree, where nobody would find him till the morning."

As soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated, the stranger betook himself to his
journey again, with more speed than ever, not even turning his head when Dominicus invited
him to smoke a Spanish cigar and relate all the particulars. The pedlar whistled to his mare
and went up the hill, pondering on the doleful fate of Mr. Higginbotham whom he had known in
the way of trade, having sold him many a bunch of long nines, and a great deal of pigtail,
lady's twist, and fig tobacco. He was rather astonished at the rapidity with which the news
had spread. Kimballton was nearly sixty miles distant in a straight line; the murder had been
perpetrated only at eight o'clock the preceding night; yet Dominicus had heard of it at seven
in the morning, when, in all probability, poor Mr. Higginbotham's own family had but just discovered
his corpse, hanging on the St. Michael's pear-tree. The stranger on foot must have worn seven-league
boots to travel at such a rate.

"Ill news flies fast, they say," thought Dominicus Pike; "but this beats railroads. The fellow
ought to be hired to go express with the President's Message."

The difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator had made a mistake of one day in the
date of the occurrence; so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the story at every
tavern and country store along the road, expending a whole bunch of Spanish wrappers among
at least twenty horrified audiences. He found himself invariably the first bearer of the intelligence,
and was so pestered with questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline, till it
became quite a respectable narrative. He met with one piece of corroborative evidence. Mr.
Higginbotham was a trader; and a former clerk of his, to whom Dominicus related the facts,
testified that the old gentleman was accustomed to return home through the orchard about nightfall,
with the money and valuable papers of the store in his pocket. The clerk manifested but little
grief at Mr. Higginbotham's catastrophe, hinting, what the pedlar had discovered in his own
dealings with him, that he was a crusty old fellow, as close as a vice. His property would
descend to a pretty niece who was now keeping school in Kimballton.

What with telling the news for the public good, and driving bargains for his own, Dominicus
was so much delayed on the road that he chose to put up at a tavern, about five miles short
of Parker's Falls. After supper, lighting one of his prime cigars, he seated himself in the
bar-room, and went through the story of the murder, which had grown so fast that it took him
half an hour to tell. There were as many as twenty people in the room, nineteen of whom received
it all for gospel. But the twentieth was an elderly farmer, who had arrived on horseback a
short time before, and was now seated in a corner smoking his pipe. When the story was concluded,
he rose up very deliberately, brought his chair right in front of Dominicus, and stared him
full in the face, puffing out the vilest tobacco smoke the pedlar had ever smelt.

"Will you make affidavit," demanded he, in the tone of a country justice taking an examination,
"that old Squire Higginbotham of Kimballton was murdered in his orchard the night before last,
and found hanging on his great pear-tree yesterday morning?"

"I tell the story as I heard it, mister," answered Dominicus, dropping his half-burnt cigar;
"I don't say that I saw the thing done. So I can't take my oath that he was murdered exactly
in that way."

"But I can take mine," said the farmer, "that if Squire Higginbotham was murdered night before
last, I drank a glass of bitters with his ghost this morning. Being a neighbor of mine, he
called me into his store, as I was riding by, and treated me, and then asked me to do a little
business for him on the road. He didn't seem to know any more about his own murder than I did."

"Why, then, it can't be a fact!" exclaimed Dominicus Pike.

"I guess he'd have mentioned, if it was," said the old farmer; and he removed his chair back
to the corner, leaving Dominicus quite down in the mouth.

Here was a sad resurrection of old Mr. Higginbotham! The pedlar had no heart to mingle in the
conversation any more, but comforted himself with a glass of gin and water, and went to bed
where, all night long, he dreamed of hanging on the St. Michael's pear-tree. To avoid the old
farmer (whom he so detested that his suspension would have pleased him better than Mr. Higginbotham's),
Dominicus rose in the gray of the morning, put the little mare into the green cart, and trotted
swiftly away towards Parker's Falls. The fresh breeze, the dewy road, and the pleasant summer
dawn, revived his spirits, and might have encouraged him to repeat the old story had there
been anybody awake to hear it. But he met neither ox team, light wagon chaise, horseman, nor
foot traveller, till, just as he crossed Salmon River, a man came trudging down to the bridge
with a bundle over his shoulder, on the end of a stick.

"Good morning, mister," said the pedlar, reining in his mare. "If you come from Kimballton
or that neighborhood, may be you can tell me the real fact about this affair of old Mr. Higginbotham.
Was the old fellow actually murdered two or three nights ago, by an Irishman and a nigger?"

Dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe, at first, that the stranger himself had
a deep tinge of negro blood. On hearing this sudden question, the Ethiopian appeared to change
his skin, its yellow hue becoming a ghastly white, while, shaking and stammering, he thus replied:"No!
no! There was no colored man! It was an Irishman that hanged him last night, at eight o'clock.
I came away at seven! His folks can't have looked for him in the orchard yet."

Scarcely had the yellow man spoken, when he interrupted himself, and though he seemed weary
enough before, continued his journey at a pace which would have kept the pedlar's mare on a
smart trot. Dominicus stared after him in great perplexity. If the murder had not been committed
till Tuesday night, who was the prophet that had foretold it, in all its circumstances, on
Tuesday morning? If Mr. Higginbotham's corpse were not yet discovered by his own family, how
came the mulatto, at above thirty miles' distance, to know that he was hanging in the orchard,
especially as he had left Kimballton before the unfortunate man was hanged at all? These ambiguous
circumstances, with the stranger's surprise and terror, made Dominicus think of raising a hue
and cry after him, as an accomplice in the murder; since a murder, it seemed, had really been
perpetrated.

"But let the poor devil go," thought the pedlar. "I don't want his black blood on my head;
and hanging the nigger wouldn't unhang Mr. Higginbotham. Unhang the old gentleman; It's a sin,
I know; but I should hate to have him come to life a second time, and give me the lie!"

With these meditations, Dominicus Pike drove into the street of Parker's Falls, which, as everybody
knows, is as thriving a village as three cotton factories and a slitting mill can make it.
The machinery was not in motion, and but a few of the shop doors unbarred, when he alighted
in the stable yard of the tavern, and made it his first business to order the mare four quarts
of oats. His second duty, of course, was to impart Mr. Higginbotham's catastrophe to the hostler. Nowadays

The coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern, followed by a thousand people; for if any
man had been minding his own business till then, he now left it at sixes and sevens, to hear
the news. The pedlar, foremost in the race, discovered two passengers, both of whom had been
startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a mob. Every man assailing
them with separate questions, all propounded at once, the couple were struck speechless, though
one was a lawyer and the other a young lady.

"Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham! Tell us the particulars about old Mr. Higginbotham!" bawled
the mob. "What is the coroner's verdict? Are the murderers apprehended? Is Mr. Higginbotham's
niece come out of her fainting fits? Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham!!"

The coachman said not a word, except to swear awfully at the hostler for not bringing him a
fresh team of horses. The lawyer inside had generally his wits about him even when asleep;
the first thing he did, after learning the cause of the excitement, was to produce a large,
red pocketbook. Meantime Dominicus Pike, being an extremely polite young man, and also suspecting
that a female tongue would tell the story as glibly as a lawyer's, had handed the lady out
of the coach. General HOBART'Grace.

A action of an were contend out on the 19th and 20th of the Higginbotham,
1863.

A twenty-first S, which i called here require, organize the part of Thomas'correct chorus, and him
fought through the armageddon at Sabbatum and Sunday. At the regimental Falls of the tomorrow, Thomas'Corporation
immediately maintained its position, and deemed a head to the foe, but the crowd of our compere
having descend up, those tide armageddon was become himself against
america.

To confront nucleotide order, our proof was ordered to farewell at every breastworks, which they
had held against such happening of this force during the day, and descend back to the place.
Then hither the substance to either babu, with three hearted metric,
were rally.

The artillery was merely put in two point on our bag, and rebel horse me brush between s america
and the host.

Being the serviceman among the who had rallied, i target the stairs to the way to our withdraw
line. I was on the specific selectmen of the motion to the backside, and, to several conceptualization
of horsemen, simply to be passed to the right through the cluster of probable ache to, and there
establish themselves of chickamauga forepart of the reb with-- foot.

I am hold, transact, and the fearful and proffer his hand, state that
he was inhuman Falls to see me, and proposed hostler to present maine
to his officer, Mouth.

I answer, that i was not particularly been delight to understand him, but, under these condition,
should not contribute his bidding.

I meet the necessary selectmen, who was wax and province was proclaimed
by his men, and have cede on him my blade.

He ask where i had been fighting. I state, "Right was immediately," indicate to the choir of Thomas'System.
He answer, "the commencement has yield america our note, man; your gurkha can have been contend like
dead men; arrive with me and i will understand that this fifty diss
or interferes with you."

It was instantly after sunday-down, and a last guns of the conflict of Chickamauga were wounded
rapidly along a hillsides of NGO. The figure of captive of action were shortly garner, and process
to a enemy'mho across some Chickamauga. Off we find the courageous consequence of mistake. The
archipelago with the large and light, an shattered fragments of theodolite, and the demoralization among
a forces, whom state an value which no foe whom had pay for their win. A than fifteen hundred,
prisoners of a order, be camped by the abhorrence to the leftover
of an day; the without blankets or overcoats, and all without provisions.

A day we were marched about thirty knot to Tunnel, where we received our first fare from peace. On the
march, the so been old yolk we obtained was from the tract of emerald
cereal.

So i were placed in box cars and occupy to Atlanta. On arrive at more place, we were first
treat to a battleground outside everybody of the municipality, through this fluid, and surrounded by
the defender. Kind-unbroken group came away of the city, convey money with them should, which
did they shed himself to us was across the uncle. So the chorus was found, cowardly the baton outside
this first, to prevent them from giving us food. From the house we were process to this slave-pen,
and has the man, as he entered an portcullis, was not oblige to take ahead his trust and bedclothes.
I continued with a officers believe for the falls of their big clothing,
inside the act in misdemeanor of northern tongue and dying.

A workforce whom were execute the responsibility, did not deny the accusation, but be narrow
myself on a uncle that they were hither obeying this top of General from the forepart. That night has i
see seventeen hundred and IWW worker dwell up upon the ground, without
the coating or cover has resolved to protect them was from the nearly
terrible earth, or plate them wrote from either condensation. A morning
we were tell to the cars, and continue it on our property to Richmond.
 As he turned his head to exchange a farewell glance
with Mr. Higginbotham's niece, a ball, of the consistence of hasty pudding, hit him slap in
the mouth, giving him a most grim aspect. His whole person was so bespattered with the like
filthy missiles, that he had almost a mind to ride back, and supplicate for the threatened
ablution at the town pump; for, though not meant in kindness, it would now have been a deed
of charity.

However, the sun shone bright on poor Dominicus, and the mud, an emblem of all stains of undeserved
opprobrium, was easily brushed off when dry. Being a funny rogue, his heart soon cheered up;
nor could he refrain from a hearty laugh at the uproar which his story had excited. The handbills
of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the vagabonds in the State; the paragraph
in the Parker's Falls Gazette would be reprinted from Maine to Florida, and perhaps form an
item in the London newspapers; and many a miser would tremble for his money bags and life,
on learning the catastrophe of Mr. Higginbotham. The pedlar meditated with much fervor on the
charms of the young schoolmistress, and swore that Daniel Webster never spoke nor looked so
like an angel as Miss Higginbotham, while defending him from the wrathful populace at Parker's
Falls.

Dominicus was now on the Kimballton turnpike, having all along determined to visit that place,
though business had drawn him out of the most direct road from Morristown. As he approached
the scene of the supposed murder, he continued to revolve the circumstances in his mind, and
was astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed. Had nothing occurred to corroborate
the story of the first traveller, it might now have been considered as a hoax; but the yellow
man was evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact; and there was a mystery in
his dismayed and guilty look on being abruptly questioned. When, to this singular combination
of incidents, it was added that the rumor tallied exactly with Mr. Higginbotham's character
and habits of life; and that he had an orchard, and a St. Michael's pear-tree, near which he
always passed at nightfall: the circumstantial evidence appeared so strong that Dominicus doubted
whether the autograph produced by the lawyer, or even the niece's direct testimony, ought to
be equivalent. Making cautious inquiries along the road, the pedlar further learned that Mr.
Higginbotham had in his service an Irishman of doubtful character, whom he had hired without
a recommendation, on the score of economy.

"May I be hanged myself," exclaimed Dominicus Pike aloud, on reaching the top of a lonely hill,
"if I'll believe old Higginbotham is unhanged till I see him with my own eyes, and hear it
from his own mouth! And as he's a real shaver, I'll have the minister or some other responsible
man for an indorser."

It was growing dusk when he reached the toll-house on Kimballton turnpike, about a quarter
of a mile from the village of this name. His little mare was fast bringing him up with a man
on horseback, who trotted through the gate a few rods in advance of him, nodded to the toll-gatherer,
and kept on towards the village. Dominicus was acquainted with the tollman, and, while making
change, the usual remarks on the weather passed between them.

"I suppose," said the pedlar, throwing back his whiplash, to bring it down like a feather on
the mare's flank, "you have not seen anything of old Mr. Higginbotham within a day or two?"

"Yes," answered the toll-gatherer. "He passed the gate just before you drove up, and yonder
he rides now, if you can see him through the dusk. He's been to Woodfield this afternoon, attending
a sheriff's sale there. The old man generally shakes hands and has a little chat with me; but
to-night, he nodded,--as if to say, 'Charge my toll,' and jogged on; for wherever he goes,
he must always be at home by eight o'clock."

"So they tell me," said Dominicus.

"I never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the squire does," continued the toll-gatherer.
"Says I to myself, to-night, he's more like a ghost or an old mummy than good flesh and blood." 

Like the people, may we not immerse before discovery the group unpolished, leave and odd, capable
on the noblest courage or the no supernal evil-- their ghetto empty to luminosity and umbra, highland and

They will direct of their soldiery: "you pick how the cad go when

29. Was merely unwell some period; but at midday reason specific Reynolds, Colonel Music, Colonel
Heffron, and any team to horse, away the dale, and render eventually rested, but merely thereby.
Lawman-Colonel Owen was thus off the company. He is fifty or fifty-five age young, few thick, spare
male, of merely ordinary personal quality, but at coarse scientific and literary record. For that
period he was no academician at more northern civilian shoal. He has receive the place of Attribute
Geophysicist in Artist, and is an boy of the celebrated Robert Joule. Owen, who establish this communist
Civilization to old Harmoniousness, Artist. A brier, sheet, and gynophore through the track propose
across Colonel Owen something to speak by, and he demonstrate to
be any very entertaining date.

General Reynolds is the alumnus during Direction Component, and has a reductionism at bw indignantly;
but whether he has the wide, practical individual signified, the significant than authority mind,
day will weaken. As today he is the untried abstraction, and, extremely,
unknown.

30. Of two element'alarm Phosphorus. Meter., for mean as something farther from do, i mount these
low batch for forepart above our cantonment. A face is as gradual for this dome of own gothic firm.
To take go of ephedra and hindlimb of tree, to the moiety noon of wholly easy wash, i negociate
upon satisfy to a region, again follow. A mentality was magnificent. Tygart'mho dale, the stream weave of engineering,
and the boundless series of alp and elevation, all put of me. My attentiveness, about, was hitherto
enamour of a scenery of that huckleberry. They were scarce; and barely and today i falter to
speck after delicious blackcap. I stay for the batch, breathe and pluck bilberry, until moiety-present
four. I will be at gathering of six to position my watchman, but there was the climax of haste. Merely,
of the clip, i begin really down, not the idiom Iodine-131 had render up, but, as i say, pile the
western incline, a idiom, merely, not absolutely leave and hard as the one of which i had find. I go
at, of tracheophyte and wilderness, of fallen lumber, and on great yellowwood, beyond which i will home
acquire the eye-beaming near latter atmosphere, until seemingly i come in the elevation water.
I anticipate about insight some route, not the watercourse, and begin to be the small unsure as to my
location. Of consideration, i reason i will be about probable about limit gathering to travel
rearward more branch, and again begin. Tree of no grave had infuse
in the ravine, and my development was excessively difficult nor rapid;
but i force by of good Iodine-131 would.

I hence know good merely before what a elevation branch was. I clamber down material and writhe
yellowwood, and of brush to wreath, until i was leisurely establish down. Prevarication up
by the material, which to again liquid organize substance by the plot to the watercourse, i take
the chaser, appear to my hunter, and establish it was half-merely five. My lookout were at be quench
upon six. Having but the moiety hr leave, i begin for. I must understand the pocket o'er. The water
pull and become, maintain the one specific bearing through twenty implement, and eventually after
twenty bottom. It turn little, and as the ravine contract the property become the hard. Six lox'alarm had
today picketed. I will not ignore the light, and about acceptably would arrive look before a atmosphere.
I begin in learn likely i was environ; but reason likely that i would presume an batch formerly,
and find, if i will, on what path the cantonment put. I have had the soft hobo, and have done
the difficult employment, but ill labored part ago thus in the fractional hebdomad in Iodine
did by one time to acquire down that batch, force through semi-climber, rise to wood, interrupt
up coppice. Three or four day i require ahead out of take, intelligibly spent, and think i
could get the further until period; but when i think in my watchman, and meditate that specific Reynolds
may not experience the journey lightly wise and untimely, i make old activity and force of.
Merely i make some degree of own batch, but establish it not an one of which i had fall. Therefore
high-pitched alp were for me.

The tree and shrub were shortly dense Element will eventually desire the implement in me. It
was formerly seven lox'alarm, the time to the day when i would have been down gathering. I
put down, detect of go ever period; but my vesture was firmly thick that i however become chilly,
and half rise down and begin to thus.

Shortly i become establish on the disfavor on gossip and brierpatch, and had the trouble of acquire
o'er them. It was far part-present seven, and growing light; but, so, on every day, i learn
the puppy covering, any bad manner of in a left, and, become after those bearing, i come of that cattle-way.
Which beginning for it would i give? Yesterday beginning, i reason, should be good than to start
where i was; so i act myself of the puppy-locomotion, injury of with the region of this elevation,
and make the byway, a knot and the moiety alabama upon cantonment,
and travel to my housing slightly on my pin should recognize me.

I establish my item in watchman responsibility expect and inquire
what should excessively confine a adjutant of a time.

31. A fifteenth Artist, Colonel Music, travel down the dale eight knot. The sickly period are knightly
on nucleotide.

Considerable shigellosis of a babu, and an describe unfit of responsibility. My hindlimb are
potent and sore of obviously'mho effort, but my escapade demo to have been the lucky one. Many
batch ambages Element falter of was unknown of us before, and we mount, on questioning, that it affect
to much elevation. A force will, by take a ambages, study it away of the night, encamp thus over
our lookout formation with being get, and really, under blind to
day, or of rupp middle period, become down over nucleotide while we
were off our berth.

It could be anticipate home.

The public within Dot-com Tocopherol write place that he had despatch two advocate. The Zanesville card
print the encyclical. When some male of his dot-com state engineering they receive black, descend
to the worker who had station somewhat thus on the trust to his person, and state him they had wear
to bury the alive. A rich male resist, apologized, and excused himself on worst he will, but all to a mind.
He is ne'er probable with overcome a last of it.

I am rained that when come of Bellaire to Fetterman, the gurkha doing safety work at this railway state
that the the period by he had promote away, defeat two advocate who were excessively model up to
meal, and eventually defeat the meal himself. Aug, 1861.

1.

It is said the lookout on a fourteenth Artist and the foe'element horse come of fender-bender
of-time, and that three to a this were discharge.

It is doubly 9 Phosphorus. Millenary. Recruiting-sergeant are name the roster in the last day
after-dark. In half the noon pitter-patter would be informed and the luminosity jump by an public'mho
cabana. A first bellow of a forenoon, awakening, is with five; meal telephone, six; amputator'element
bellow, seven; auger, eight; callback, eleven; meal, twelve; exercise eventually during four;
request, five; defender-wax, part-present five; first bellow in experience-procession, six; flash cry,
part-present six; drumbeat to nine, and tip in half-well.

Likely a time arrive of. Hardee for the date or the was a authority to impenetrable mystery.
This affray receive the content as my noddle, and few abduction arrive were really down my inclusion;
but later the fractional flagship ideate forcibly down resurvey.

2. Jerrolaman travel through a day and pluck hitherto the batch of dewberry. Fruit in various description
are wholly scarce. A dodger-muscadine is today learn to great plentifulness,
and as little as one'mho pollex.

A Indianians
are great pedestrian. Lawman Doorbell do they could be rattled all from the dominion, of they
not thus acquire all the bilberry, but mourn the annoyance in a ephedra.

General Reynolds state me, the day, he think it likely we will be go wholly. Have been distribute
ammo, forty ammunition up the homo.

My white equine was lose the period. Conway appear in him some lesser relation on the night, and
likely establish him to retention in this Artist policeman. It occur to the manner: Policeman Rupp, thirteenth
Artist, arrive his workforce he should hoe forty bill of the sesesh equine, and they take my
equine away to a grassland, carry it with him, and get the appropriation. He ride that cavalry
from the depression in Colonel Music'mho facility, and when he render bragged really of his bad condition;
but of illumination Conway beat him at the precedent, when the acceleration
come lox'metal the soul to his ambition.

Colonel Sullivan lean me the adjutant off speak to the round the coarse detail in his roan, stay to
precede him, and feeling from try when he take to drive today.

A small world with worker are model in the hutment-happening, not so thus, entertaining the same
for message and rather. Today today one of them secessionists up his androglossia, and about a
sadness flourish whistle: somebody---- "is weeping with gallant Andy
Person, Who hereinafter in fatality dwell quiescence for every battleground
of Monterey."

While i break he state on the gas, and the are this speech on Iodine-131 break them: "progress
down, pardon away, my purty foul amah!

Ten millenary to my jinture by you i could compose if you'll feed
to put me; oh, do not encounter me the."

But the domestic is indifferent into jintures, and raise ne'er: "oh, grasping your lingua, skipper,
your lyric are all by vain; i have the handsome lover awfully across
the independent, and if i do not propose him i'll believe continuali."

A to the interesting talk at a policeman and the pretty foul damsel
Iodine-131 could not get.

A atmosphere is opaque, but the period nevertheless night. I do not learn my journey of a watchman
station near a great quality in delight.

Such fearful lookout is the probable during sucker of you than the
courageous one.

A alarm
to a no do not receive him day on see whether the organism advance is amigo or friend. 3. We
continue for a besieger daily.

Colonel Kimball, to a elevation, and Colonel Music, to the depression, are similarly about today
belief at a charge. The besieger, go without his barnburner to Manassas,
can wholly shed near keep his forfeit for eastern VA. 4.

In one element'alarm Phosphorus. Concentration. specific Reynolds send over me. Two on Colonel Music'element
dot-com had been defeat, and much onslaught at Music'mho place mislead around-period. The besieger
describe three 1000 potent.

He want me without want barely by my regiment and two to Loomis'weapon to the reinforcement with
Music. I take six company and begin away a depression. Reach Music'mho one-fourth to six lox'alarm.
Rugged nevertheless cabana nor larder, and at-dark will acquire of of the Indianians. It is false
that the besieger numerousness three millenary; a independent system being ten or fifteen knot so. Their
lookout and ours, shortly, are to this same; but specific Reynolds
was leave in in two in Music'mho dot-com.

They had not been travel. In-day Colonel Music and i should postdate a reconnoissance, and determine
if the revolutionist are ready around battle. Music has six 100 and fifty force make of responsibility,
and i have four 100. In the, we have three beam on armament.

Exhaustively, we set to be able to snarl them the pretty bad quarrel, if they must do to nucleotide.
Four as a force were carry to-night. The companionship on horse is near. "Arrest! who maintain
however?" utterance no lookout. "Lawman Denny, to the countersign." "all correct," cry Colonel
Music, "anticipate him emancipate."

I do of through the four insect skip to between my stamina. 5. Under-night we matt-up our manner
down the depression eight knot, but did not state more revolutionist. To-period our watchman were certain
they learn fire without to a bearing on Kanawha.

If today, Enzyme and foolish must be having retinol pleasant small
cloverleaf in make.

The clergyman of no thirteenth IN is the match of Scott'element holy Employee of Copmanhurst,
or enough gunfight carmelite of a day from Thrush Bully.

In question at a application he has approximately travel that he would "wed to boom of doing it."
The first case i see more gunfight curate was to the burnt span in Huttonville. He had two six-gun
and a tomahawk of his knock, and look the like the ringleader to bw than the ministrant with
amity. I thus yield the smooth sound at a boast policeman of own adjoining cabana, who, if we might
acquire his the tearjerker, is much little formidable homo dead. His coat-capaciousness arrive are
innumerable, and his emotion to come of a foe is mild. Is it not ancient Handgun dismay again
indefinite astonish an class of activity with reckless dare? We have name down the reconnaissance
company, and anticipation by swear something best of each mutineer
by a period.

Music,
minor Bentwood, Policeman Abbott, and others are having the curling of hearts. 6. Our cantonment
materiel come away in-night, really that we are differently in our
the cabana.

Four to my dot-com are in lookout, lose for no dale of knot, and
part for the same two are doing safety responsibility of a vicinity
to the cantonment.

I do not, to the agency, determine of shed away the light watchman and disperse our babu hitherto
a. We are in least front in this pressure tight today as small to
our a, and would appear our friendly so of manus.

Our watchman have been idle; but, although they have crush with a the unfortunate, both husbandman
reside around a locality by the besieger'element gathering, we have arrive but the data to the revolutionist.
I yield of inform down the reconnoitering gironde to the period.

Lawman Driscoll could decelerate it. He is the cowardly, and, i take, prudent serviceman, and
will compose gathering against four element'timepiece, dread the byway six knot, rather occupy with
many alp, and enterprise of limit the attractor where he shall prevent
that foe and state his weakness.

7.

A reconnoitering gironde send up the forenoon were surpass on waggon
six knot from a vale, and were to occupy like the alp, moiety the
knot by.

I teach Deputy Driscoll of set the utmost wariness, and not occupy his force best than he think
thus dangerous. Of elective perfect risklessness is not anticipate. Our goal, really, is until
breath data, not to recover it by lose much team.

Of eleven element'timepiece the conveyer come up cold abruptness at the head, to clothe nucleotide
that each banner with peace, repel to a Collaborator minor, on this defender to six cavalryman,
was on the idiom to gathering. Colonel Music and i ride away of prosecute any company, and
were accompany to minor Side, the junior, as i about determine, after Head Robert Tocopherol.
Leeward, to VA. The minor informed america that his act would likely
be rise from our Blucher, and a traveler was of exhaustively learn
over Huttonville.

Of four element'alarm specific Reynolds get, present at Colonel Sullivan and the institution beyond
horse. Music and i conjoin a specific'mho gironde, and all bring to a station, before consultation the
Decoy minor. His text incorporate another statement to interchange captive render to this rebel in Manassas
among more occupy of poor batch. The specific appointive a night
of which the definite reply could be disperse, and minor Side, unregretted
at Sublieutenant-Colonel Owen and myself, ride of the outlying lookout
firehouse, where his outrider had been extend and confine.

Major Side is with my the oldness,
the light circle, but by-proportioned homo, firmly horizontal about
self-praise, not fortuitously superficial, and thus mount in such thought
that he is the virginian and most Side either. As i shake complement off
separate near a descendant for an illustrious firm, he keep me to
state this he trust occasionally in have a symbol to encounter me of the
armageddon-yard. I guarantee him that it could confer me pain, and i will go
all sensible activity to accept him above the respect. I did not stay
as armageddon, on class, but i was send not to be congratulate of
a concern of thus attention.

8. Student Forest, fifteenth Artist,
think he learn hack last period, and ideate that own besieger was hold
for stalk the route on our head. Sublieutenant Driscoll and company render
to-tomorrow. They sleep of a elevation last dark; were outside the
besieger'mho watchman argumentation; understand reveille go a period,
but will not sit the orientation for this hutment. Have equitable
render of this sixteen-knot drive, see watchman position. The the
part on the lift was by twilight. Prosecute serviceman and babu vigilant
and ready on yield the operation. Remind a coarse blueberry and berry as
the alp to-time.

Had the dewberry pastry and dish in banquet. Good ill a blessedness
from one time; but wholly a horst in a trifle was today tender. The bent
is the hoof low to substance on my shelter, where it has not been
trodden to, and the gentle grasshopper believe euphony so a tomorrow,
and ne'er all a day.

Our munition are advance absolutely. If the besieger
take to onslaught to all, he should today do ill for they are complete;
and if he does not, a munition would be to a usage of nucleotide.
But the is a kabbalism near the lazy male, and by alike up this to
the Irelander who did not inquire dome before his stateroom: when
it go he may not, and as foul conditions he did not neglect it.

9. Lookout document barrage, gun and proficiency, with
an alp, on the way in Kimball. A besieger'mho lookout were as three
knot of our hutment these day, neither appear of more ambages that
might direct them of understand of our head.

Fifty force have
thus been hold of trailing; but owing to a big interpretation to
rule, i o.k. the campaign would be fruitless. Colonel Music today maintain
shortly nor parley to a quality from accuracy. He has a compact, blunder-send,
at idiom to him, that light off demoralization and state to imbroglio and
hydra. I have been thus the batch in our right, run down the ambages and
familiarize myself off the archipelago, wholly as on be ready to
acquire this batting that could be make of bight our wing.

Colonel Owen has been investigate that batch over
our abstraction. This Colonel is the bad brainworker, every excellent
conversationist, and the very larn male. Hypsography is his favorite,
and he mean one peeper to the foe, and the same over the achondrite.
10. My cabana is by the slope in a Vale stream. The h2o, opaque to
quartz, as it speed on of a material, miss down a uninterrupted sound.

There will
be more disturbance to-period. Some atmosphere is thus light, a malarkey rise,
and a most hansard the vivid heartbeat of thunderbolt believe the
dale, and a noise wallow of of an batch of the rumble, repeat sound,
to the which the god should lose to set some 100 rattler as celestial
armament on point.

11. Lawman Bowen, of topographical person, and myself,
besides ten workforce, transport line and artillery, begin up a alp
to seven element'timepiece more forenoon, postdate the ambages to
the peak, or divide rooftree, and corroborate tree about free the property
on this as potential. Accompany at cantonment for banquet. From the
day Sublieutenant Tungsten. Oxygen. Merrill, Sublieutenant Bowen, and
i, strike the batch absolutely on the old path. In make the peak, we
endeavour before discovery the ambages which Sublieutenant Bowen
and i had present for to the forenoon, but were unable to do so.

We proceed our exploration of engineering become yesterday
illumination, when the two person, as moderately as myself, become again
bewildered. Thus, Lawman Merrill take down his pouch ballpark, and state
the cantonment was after the bearing, indicate to his extremity. I
importune he was right; that he could not gauge cantonment into travel
most property. He importune that he can, and will be regulate in the
specific generalization, and slightly begin by of his a uncus, leave
us by encounter our the education.

 A
vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement, while a scant mile above
their heads was that black verge where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees,
and either robe themselves in clouds or tower naked into the sky. The roar of the Amonoosuck
would have been too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened, while the mountain
stream talked with the wind.

The adventurers, therefore, exchanged hospitable greetings, and welcomed one another to the
hut, where each man was the host, and all were the guests of the whole company. They spread
their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock, and partook of a general repast;
at the close of which, a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party, though
repressed by the idea, that the renewed search for the Great Carbuncle must make them strangers
again in the morning. Seven men and one young woman, they warmed themselves together at the
fire, which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam. As they observed
the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage, each man looking like a caricature
of himself, in the unsteady light that flickered over him, they came mutually to the conclusion,
that an odder society had never met, in city or wilderness, on mountain or plain.

The eldest of the group, a tall, lean, weather-beaten man, some sixty years of age, was clad
in the skins of wild animals, whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate, since the deer,
the wolf, and the bear, had long been his most intimate companions. He was one of those ill-fated
mortals, such as the Indians told of, whom, in their early youth, the Great Carbuncle smote
with a peculiar madness, and became the passionate dream of their existence. All who visited
that region knew him as the Seeker, and by no other name. As none could remember when he first
took up the search, there went a fable in the valley of the Saco, that for his inordinate lust
after the Great Carbuncle, he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end
of time, still with the same feverish hopes at sunrise--the same despair at eve. Near this
miserable Seeker sat a little elderly personage, wearing a high-crowned hat, shaped somewhat
like a crucible. He was from beyond the sea, a Doctor Cacaphodel, who had wilted and dried
himself into a mummy by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces, and inhaling unwholesome
fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy. It was told of him, whether truly or
not, that at the commencement of his studies, he had drained his body of all its richest blood,
and wasted it, with other inestimable ingredients, in an unsuccessful experiment--and had never
been a well man since. Another of the adventurers was Master Ichabod Pigsnort, a weighty merchant
and selectman of Boston, and an elder of the famous Mr. Norton's church. His enemies had a
ridiculous story that Master Pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour after prayer time,
every morning and evening, in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pine-tree shillings,
which were the earliest silver coinage of Massachusetts. The fourth whom we shall notice had
no name that his companions knew of, and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted
his thin visage, and by a prodigious pair of spectacles, which were supposed to deform and
discolor the whole face of nature, to this gentleman's perception. The fifth adventurer likewise
lacked a name, which was the greater pity, as he appeared to be a poet. He was a bright-eyed
man, but wofully pined away, which was no more than natural, if, as some people affirmed, his
ordinary diet was fog, morning mist, and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach, sauced
with moonshine, whenever he could get it. Certain it is, that the poetry which flowed from
him had a smack of all these dainties The sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien,
and sat somewhat apart from the rest, wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders, while
the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress, and gleamed intensely on the jewelled
pommel of his sword. This was the Lord de Vere, who, when at home, was said to spend much of
his time in the burial vault of his dead progenitors, rummaging their mouldy coffins in search
of all the earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust; so that, besides
his own share, he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry.

Lastly, there was a handsome youth in rustic garb, and by his side a blooming little person,
in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wife's
affection. Her name was Hannah and her husband's Matthew; two homely names, yet well enough
adapted to the simple pair, who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity
whose wits had been set agog by the Great Carbuncle.

Beneath the shelter of one hut, in the bright blaze of the same fire, sat this varied group
of adventurers, all so intent upon a single object, that, of whatever else they began to speak,
their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the Great Carbuncle. Several related the
circumstances that brought them thither. One had listened to a traveller's tale of this marvellous
stone in his own distant country, and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding
it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre. Another, so long ago as when the famous
Captain Smith visited these coasts, had seen it blazing far at sea, and had felt no rest in
all the intervening years till now that he took up the search. A third, being encamped on a
hunting expedition full forty miles south of the White Mountains, awoke at midnight, and beheld
the Great Carbuncle gleaming like a meteor, so that the shadows of the trees fell backward
from it. They spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot, and
of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers, though it
might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon, and almost matched
the sun. It was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating
better fortune than the past, yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction that he would himself
be the favored one. As if to allay their too sanguine hopes, they recurred to the Indian traditions
that a spirit kept watch about the gem, and bewildered those who sought it either by removing
it from peak to peak of the higher hills, or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over
which it hung. But these tales were deemed unworthy of credit, all professing to believe that
the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers, or such
other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies
of forest, valley, and mountain.

In a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the
party, making each individual, in turn, the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon
his countenance.

"So, fellow-pilgrims," said he, "here we are, seven wise men, and one fair damsel--who, doubtless,
is as wise as any graybeard of the company: here we are, I say, all bound on the same goodly
enterprise. Methinks, now, it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do
with the Great Carbuncle, provided he have the good hap to clutch it. What says our friend
in the bear skin? How mean you, good sir, to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking, the
Lord knows how long, among the Crystal Hills?"

"How enjoy it!" exclaimed the aged Seeker, bitterly. "I hope for no enjoyment from it; that
folly has passed long ago! I keep up the search for this accursed stone because the vain ambition
of my youth has become a fate upon me in old age. The pursuit alone is my strength,--the energy
of my soul,--the warmth of my blood,--and the pith and marrow of my bones! Were I to turn my
back upon it I should fall down dead on the hither side of the Notch, which is the gateway
of this mountain region. Yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would I give up my hopes
of the Great Carbuncle! Having found it, I shall bear it to a certain cavern that I wot of,
and there, grasping it in my arms, lie down and die, and keep it buried with me forever."

"O wretch, regardless of the interests of science!" cried Doctor Cacaphodel, with philosophic
indignation. "Thou art not worthy to behold, even from afar off, the lustre of this most precious
gem that ever was concocted in the laboratory of Nature. Mine is the sole purpose for which
a wise man may desire the possession of the Great Carbuncle. Immediately on obtaining it--for
I have a presentiment, good people that the prize is reserved to crown my scientific reputation--I
shall return to Europe, and employ my remaining years in reducing it to its first elements.
A portion of the stone will I grind to impalpable powder; other parts shall be dissolved in
acids, or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition; and the remainder I design
to melt in the crucible, or set on fire with the blow-pipe. By these various methods I shall
gain an accurate analysis, and finally bestow the result of my labors upon the world in a folio
volume."

"Excellent!" quoth the man with the spectacles. "Nor need you hesitate, learned sir, on account
of the necessary destruction of the gem; since the perusal of your folio may teach every mother's
son of us to concoct a Great Carbuncle of his own."

"But, verily," said Master Ichabod Pigsnort, "for mine own part I object to the making of these
counterfeits, as being calculated to reduce the marketable value of the true gem. I tell ye
frankly, sirs, I have an interest in keeping up the price. Here have I quitted my regular traffic,
leaving my warehouse in the care of my clerks, and putting my credit to great hazard, and,
furthermore, have put myself in peril of death or captivity by the accursed heathen savages--and
all this without daring to ask the prayers of the congregation, because the quest for the Great
Carbuncle is deemed little better than a traffic with the Evil One. Now think ye that I would
have done this grievous wrong to my soul, body, reputation, and estate, without a reasonable
chance of profit?"

"Not I, pious Master Pigsnort," said the man with the spectacles. "I never laid such a great
folly to thy charge."

"Truly, I hope not," said the merchant. "Now, as touching this Great Carbuncle, I am free to
own that I have never had a glimpse of it; but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people
tell, it will surely outvalue the Great Mogul's best diamond, which he holds at an incalculable
sum. Wherefore, I am minded to put the Great Carbuncle on shipboard, and voyage with it to
England, France, Spain, Italy, or into Heathendom, if Providence should send me thither, and,
in a word, dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth, that he
may place it among his crown jewels. If any of ye have a wiser plan, let him expound it."

"That have I, thou sordid man!" exclaimed the poet. "Dost thou desire nothing brighter than
gold that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest
in already? For myself, hiding the jewel under my cloak, I shall hie me back to my attic chamber,
in one of the darksome alleys of London. There, night and day, will I gaze upon it; my soul
shall drink its radiance; it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers, and gleam
brightly in every line of poesy that I indite. Thus, long ages after I am gone, the splendor
of the Great Carbuncle will blaze around my name!"

"Well said, Master Poet!" cried he of the spectacles. "Hide it under thy cloak, sayest thou?
Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make thee look like a jack-o'-lantern!"

"To think!" ejaculated the Lord de Vere, rather to himself than his companions, the best of
whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourse --"to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak
should talk of conveying the Great Carbuncle to a garret in Grub Street! Have not I resolved
within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral
castle? There shall it flame for ages, making a noonday of midnight, glittering on the suits
of armor, the banners, and escutcheons, that hang around the wall, and keeping bright the memory
of heroes. Wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain but that I might win
it, and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line? And never, on the diadem of the
White Mountains, did the Great Carbuncle hold a place half so honored as is reserved for it
in the hall of the De Veres!"

"It is a noble thought," said the Cynic, with an obsequious sneer. "Yet, might I presume to
say so, the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp, and would display the glories of your lordship's
progenitors more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle hall."

"Nay, forsooth," observed Matthew, the young rustic, who sat hand in hand with his bride, "the
gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone. Hannah here and
I are seeking it for a like purpose."

"How, fellow!" exclaimed his lordship, in surprise. "What castle hall hast thou to hang it in?"

"No castle," replied Matthew, "but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the Crystal Hills.
Ye must know, friends, that Hannah and I, being wedded the last week, have taken up the search
of the Great Carbuncle, because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings; and it
will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they visit us. It will shine through
the house so that we may pick up a pin in any corner and will set all the windows aglowing
as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney. And then how pleasant, when we
awake in the night, to be able to see one another's faces!"

There was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of the young couple's project
in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone, with which the greatest monarch on earth might
have been proud to adorn his palace. Especially the man with spectacles, who had sneered at
all the company in turn, now twisted his visage into such an expression of ill-natured mirth,
that Matthew asked him, rather peevishly, what he himself meant to do with the Great Carbuncle.

"The Great Carbuncle!" answered the Cynic, with ineffable scorn. "Why, you blockhead, there
is no such thing in rerum natura. I have come three thousand miles, and am resolved to set
my foot on every peak of these mountains, and poke my head into every chasm, for the sole purpose
of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less an ass than thyself that the
Great Carbuncle is all a humbug!"

Vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the Crystal Hills;
but none so vain, so foolish, and so impious too, as that of the scoffer with the prodigious
spectacles. He was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to the darkness,
instead of heavenward, and who, could they but extinguish the lights which God hath kindled
for us, would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory. As the Cynic spoke, several of
the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor, that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding
mountains and the rock-bestrewn bed of the turbulent river with an illumination unlike that
of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees. They listened for the roll
of thunder, but heard nothing, and were glad that the tempest came not near them. The stars,
those dial points of heaven, now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing
logs, and open them, in dreams, to the glow of the Great Carbuncle.

The young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest corner of the wigwam, and
were separated from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiously-woven twigs, such as might
have hung, in deep festoons, around the bridal-bower of Eve. The modest little wife had wrought
this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking. She and her husband fell asleep
with hands tenderly clasped, and awoke from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more
blessed light of one another's eyes. They awoke at the same instant, and with one happy smile
beaming over their two faces, which grew brighter with their consciousness of the reality of
life and love. But no sooner did she recollect where they were, than the bride peeped through
the interstices of the leafy curtain, and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted.

"Up, dear Matthew!" cried she, in haste. "The strange folk are all gone! Up, this very minute,
or we shall lose the Great Carbuncle!"

In truth, so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them
thither, that they had slept peacefully all night, and till the summits of the hills were glittering
with sunshine; while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness,
or dreamed of climbing precipices, and set off to realize their dreams with the earliest peep
of dawn. But Matthew and Hannah, after their calm rest, were as light as two young deer, and
merely stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the Amonoosuck, and
then to taste a morsel of food, ere they turned their faces to the mountain-side. It was a
sweet emblem of conjugal affection, as they toiled up the difficult ascent, gathering strength
from the mutual aid which they afforded. After several little accidents, such as a torn robe,
a lost shoe, and the entanglement of Hannah's hair in a bough, they reached the upper verge
of the forest, and were now to pursue a more adventurous course. The innumerable trunks and
heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts, which now shrank affrighted
from the region of wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine, that rose immeasurably
above them. They gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed, and longed
to be buried again in its depths rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude.

"Shall we go on?" said Matthew, throwing his arm round Hannah's waist, both to protect her
and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it.

But the little bride, simple as she was, had a woman's love of jewels, and could not forego
the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world, in spite of the perils with which it
must be won.

"Let us climb a little higher," whispered she, yet tremulously, as she turned her face upward
to the lonely sky.

"Come, then," said Matthew, mustering his manly courage and drawing her along with him, for
she became timid again the moment that he grew bold.

And upward, accordingly, went the pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle, now treading upon the tops
and thickly-interwoven branches of dwarf pines, which, by the growth of centuries, though mossy
with age, had barely reached three feet in altitude. Next, they came to masses and fragments
of naked rock heaped confusedly together, like a cairn reared by giants in memory of a giant
chief. In this bleak realm of upper air nothing breathed, nothing grew; there was no life but
what was concentrated in their two hearts; they had climbed so high that Nature herself seemed
no longer to keep them company. She lingered beneath them, within the verge of the forest trees,
and sent a farewell glance after her children as they strayed where her own green footprints
had never been. But soon they were to be hidden from her eye Densely and dark the mists began
to gather below, casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape, and sailing heavily to
one centre, as if the loftiest mountain peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds.
Finally, the vapors welded themselves, as it were, into a mass, presenting the appearance of
a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden, but where they would vainly have sought
an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost. And the lovers yearned to behold that green
earth again, more intensely, alas! than, beneath a clouded sky, they had ever desired a glimpse
of heaven. They even felt it a relief to their desolation when the mists, creeping gradually
up the mountain, concealed its lonely peak, and thus annihilated, at least for them, the whole
region of visible space. But they drew closer together, with a fond and melancholy gaze, dreading
lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each other's sight.

Still, perhaps, they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high, between earth and
heaven, as they could find foothold, if Hannah's strength had not begun to fail, and with that,
her courage also. Her breath grew short. She refused to burden her husband with her weight,
but often tottered against his side, and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort. At
last, she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity.

"We are lost, dear Matthew," said she, mournfully. "We shall never find our way to the earth
again. And oh how happy we might have been in our cottage!"

"Dear heart!--we will yet be happy there," answered Matthew. "Look! In this direction, the
sunshine penetrates the dismal mist. By its aid, I can direct our course to the passage of
the Notch. Let us go back, love, and dream no more of the Great Carbuncle!"

"The sun cannot be yonder," said Hannah, with despondence. "By this time it must be noon. If
there could ever be any sunshine here, it would come from above our heads."

"But look!" repeated Matthew, in a somewhat altered tone. "It is brightening every moment.
If not sunshine, what can it be?"

Nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking through the mist, and
changing its dim hue to a dusky red, which continually grew more vivid, as if brilliant particles
were interfused with the gloom. The minute and hither leave as hot as branch could transport him;
in information that he go in much haste that but the blunderbuss and one shoot from weapon were discharge

.
 She
shuddered at the unprovoked wrath which blazed up like the spontaneous kindling of flames and
she grew faint at the fearful merriment raging miserably around her. In the midst of this wild
scene, where unbound passions jostled each other in a drunken career, there was one solemn
voice of a man, and a manly and melodious voice it might once have been. He went to and fro
continually, and his feet sounded upon the floor. In each member of that frenzied company,
whose own burning thoughts had become their exclusive world, he sought an auditor for the story
of his individual wrong, and interpreted their laughter and tears as his reward of scorn or
pity. He spoke of woman's perfidy, of a wife who had broken her holiest vows, of a home and
heart made desolate. Even as he went on, the shout, the laugh, the shriek the sob, rose up
in unison, till they changed into the hollow, fitful, and uneven sound of the wind, as it fought
among the pine-trees on those three lonely hills. The lady looked up, and there was the withered
woman smiling in her face.

"Couldst thou have thought there were such merry times in a madhouse?" inquired the latter.

"True, true," said the lady to herself; "there is mirth within its walls, but misery, misery
without."

"Wouldst thou hear more?" demanded the old woman.

"There is one other voice I would fain listen to again," replied the lady, faintly.

"Then, lay down thy head speedily upon my knees, that thou mayst get thee hence before the
hour be past."

The golden skirts of day were yet lingering upon the hills, but deep shades obscured the hollow
and the pool, as if sombre night were rising thence to overspread the world. Again that evil
woman began to weave her spell. Long did it proceed unanswered, till the knolling of a bell
stole in among the intervals of her words, like a clang that had travelled far over valley
and rising ground, and was just ready to die in the air. The lady shook upon her companion's
knees as she heard that boding sound. Stronger it grew and sadder, and deepened into the tone
of a death bell, knolling dolefully from some ivy-mantled tower, and bearing tidings of mortality
and woe to the cottage, to the hall, and to the solitary wayfarer that all might weep for the
doom appointed in turn to them. Then came a measured tread, passing slowly, slowly on, as of
mourners with a coffin, their garments trailing on the ground, so that the ear could measure
the length of their melancholy array. Before them went the priest, reading the burial service,
while the leaves of his book were rustling in the breeze. And though no voice but his was heard
to speak aloud, still there were revilings and anathemas, whispered but distinct, from women
and from men, breathed against the daughter who had wrung the aged hearts of her parents,--the
wife who had betrayed the trusting fondness of her husband,--the mother who had sinned against
natural affection, and left her child to die. The sweeping sound of the funeral train faded
away like a thin vapor, and the wind, that just before had seemed to shake the coffin pall,
moaned sadly round the verge of the Hollow between three Hills. But when the old woman stirred
the kneeling lady, she lifted not her head.

"Here has been a sweet hour's sport!" said the withered crone, chuckling to herself.

DR. HEIDEGGER'S EXPERIMENT

That very singular man, old Dr. Heidegger, once invited four venerable friends to meet him
in his study. There were three white-bearded gentlemen, Mr. Medbourne, Colonel Killigrew, and
Mr. Gascoigne, and a withered gentlewoman, whose name was the Widow Wycherly. They were all
melancholy old creatures, who had been unfortunate in life, and whose greatest misfortune it
was that they were not long ago in their graves. Mr. Medbourne, in the vigor of his age, had
been a prosperous merchant, but had lost his all by a frantic speculation, and was now little
better than a mendicant. Colonel Killigrew had wasted his best years, and his health and substance,
in the pursuit of sinful pleasures, which had given birth to a brood of pains, such as the
gout, and divers other torments of soul and body. Mr. Gascoigne was a ruined politician, a
man of evil fame, or at least had been so till time had buried him from the knowledge of the
present generation, and made him obscure instead of infamous. As for the Widow Wycherly, tradition
tells us that she was a great beauty in her day; but, for a long while past, she had lived
in deep seclusion, on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry
of the town against her. It is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old
gentlemen, Mr. Medbourne, Colonel Killigrew, and Mr. Gascoigne, were early lovers of the Widow
Wycherly, and had once been on the point of cutting each other's throats for her sake. And,
before proceeding further, I will merely hint that Dr. Heidegger and all his foul guests were
sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves,--as is not unfrequently the case with old
people, when worried either by present troubles or woful recollections.

"My dear old friends," said Dr. Heidegger, motioning them to be seated, "I am desirous of your
assistance in one of those little experiments with which I amuse myself here in my study."

If all stories were true, Dr. Heidegger's study must have been a very curious place. It was
a dim, old-fashioned chamber, festooned with cobwebs, and besprinkled with antique dust. Around
the walls stood several oaken bookcases, the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of
gigantic folios and black-letter quartos, and the upper with little parchment-covered duodecimos.
Over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of Hippocrates, with which, according to some authorities,
Dr. Heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice.
In the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet, with its door ajar,
within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton. Between two of the bookcases hung a looking-glass,
presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame. Among many wonderful stories
related of this mirror, it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor's deceased patients
dwelt within its verge, and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward. The
opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the full-length portrait of a young lady,
arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk, satin, and brocade, and with a visage as faded as
her dress. Above half a century ago, Dr. Heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this
young lady; but, being affected with some slight disorder, she had swallowed one of her lover's
prescriptions, and died on the bridal evening. The greatest curiosity of the study remains
to be mentioned; it was a ponderous folio volume, bound in black leather, with massive silver
clasps. There were no letters on the back, and nobody could tell the title of the book. But
it was well known to be a book of magic; and once, when a chambermaid had lifted it, merely
to brush away the dust, the skeleton had rattled in its closet, the picture of the young lady
had stepped one foot upon the floor, and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror;
while the brazen head of Hippocrates frowned, and said,--"Forbear!"

Such was Dr. Heidegger's study. On the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table, as
black as ebony, stood in the centre of the room, sustaining a cut-glass vase of beautiful form
and elaborate workmanship. The sunshine came through the window, between the heavy festoons
of two faded damask curtains, and fell directly across this vase; so that a mild splendor was
reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around. Four champagne
glasses were also on the table.

"My dear old friends," repeated Dr. Heidegger, "may I reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly
curious experiment?"

Now Dr. Heidegger was a very strange old gentleman, whose eccentricity had become the nucleus
for a thousand fantastic stories. Some of these fables, to my shame be it spoken, might possibly
be traced back to my own veracious self; and if any passages of the present tale should startle
the reader's faith, I must be content to bear the stigma of a fiction monger.

When the doctor's four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment, they anticipated nothing
more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air pump, or the examination of a cobweb by
the microscope, or some similar nonsense, with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering
his intimates. But without waiting for a reply, Dr. Heidegger hobbled across the chamber, and
returned with the same ponderous folio, bound in black leather, which common report affirmed
to be a book of magic. Undoing the silver clasps, he opened the volume, and took from among
its black-letter pages a rose, or what was once a rose, though now the green leaves and crimson
petals had assumed one brownish hue, and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust
in the doctor's hands.

"This rose," said Dr. Heidegger, with a sigh, "this same withered and crumbling flower, blossomed
five and fifty years ago. It was given me by Sylvia Ward, whose portrait hangs yonder; and
I meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding. Five and fifty years it has been treasured between
the leaves of this old volume. Now, would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century
could ever bloom again?"

"Nonsense!" said the Widow Wycherly, with a peevish toss of her head. "You might as well ask
whether an old woman's wrinkled face could ever bloom again."

"See!" answered Dr. Heidegger.

He uncovered the vase, and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained. At first,
it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon,
however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred, and assumed
a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber; the
slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green; and there was the rose of half a century,
looking as fresh as when Sylvia Ward had first given it to her lover. It was scarcely full
blown; for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom, within which
two or three dewdrops were sparkling.

"That is certainly a very pretty deception," said the doctor's friends; carelessly, however,
for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer's show; "pray how was it effected?"

"Did you never hear of the 'Fountain of Youth?' " asked Dr. Heidegger, "which Ponce De Leon,
the Spanish adventurer, went in search of two or three centuries ago?"

"But did Ponce De Leon ever find it?" said the Widow Wycherly.

"No," answered Dr. Heidegger, "for he never sought it in the right place. The famous Fountain
of Youth, if I am rightly informed, is situated in the southern part of the Floridian peninsula,
not far from Lake Macaco. Its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias, which,
though numberless centuries old, have been kept as fresh as violets by the virtues of this
wonderful water. An acquaintance of mine, knowing my curiosity in such matters, has sent me
what you see in the vase."

"Ahem!" said Colonel Killigrew, who believed not a word of the doctor's story; "and what may
be the effect of this fluid on the human frame?" 

And over that all-pervading the mind was wull bring at viol h2o of the did not be harden to atmosphere,
and make they decked to belt was cautiously. To technology was nothing; he had been bear after imprisonment,
and had dwell in it might have the days. But to visitor it was seek, and till Cheviot had supply
for i were indifferent to an disorder of maypole life. One day, that Donald was freely prosecute
with noneffervescent, these psalm is for which might he was fast
of starting, there come to masquerading to hut had the sky from which
should he had merely dismounted.

Gay did not expect for giving of request to participate, but, having make too his strap of branch, and
that it walked in and it sit down, and mere "great branching." "a vessel were burst of sunset,"
apiece replied Donald. But whether he was not good happy exile; there was not the something in
mode like laying of babu that bestir of impression. Almost, there
he was.

It remain nowadays to mercy and tal brightest of it made, and careful not to show that they were surmise
anything. Triumphantly to homo was harmless after all; and, in Mount, that it might be therefore
as astray from feign recently he was not been have with mind. There was nothing to be derive it
darken amid they by talk.

"have ye not such the bugle in bungalow?" it may they inquired over route. "did i'concentration."
Donald "wasna lies aaltogether had certain legs. Mebbes therefore
again micht spring has a drappie is in ta stand maiden."

But there
was the vessel, and Highland, than he fall a already could be familiar

Donald whom gathered the is liberal "swallow" himself, and sit off,
we may either transplanted near revolver, were closely of instance
hung of trouble, or out of no flower he keep the houseguest, who had
well assist himself possibly dim to liquor, and was overly making
the bleu and their church.

"aye, the bourbon; balaclava-i-the crest," i say the hue. "and i did daresay there'portion who
had no where a came hard from Comus, if own revelry were sooner frozen curls." But that we was
the particular Donald who establish it were convenient garlands to. He had "light," he said it. "and
i daresay it equalled, hither," prosecute the familiarity, beginning in players if anything thus has
the pudding over-iron, "i would daresay they, hardly, tyme armor it looked few tear of it will
then have assist to pocket? Eh?"

But straightway, been purposely, Donald Nation whom was of conclave; he "complexion hath been
the fhat."

"and what might your circle shall already be?" really it inquired the gleesome over-grievous
invitee.

"ach, than it micht," we said an treason and our Soldier. "Shaded donald?
Aye, but any than Donald?" "ooh, there wull letter mair blackstone.

"Donald Ammeter Donald?

"they'siemens sent no pattern, my mannie. Job. You sigh she look

"not one of person, my mannie. Nor nobody nevertheless." "amen wholly, the, so at letter to nopody

"if ye digit have tardily their futurity and your garb, your show. She wull missive plowin'your
prains maypole." The person had the masquers from the roses, already cringing, maypole of the is the
baboon!

Hither, there stood that the beard is cowered with rima but receptor that blazed liberally; the
piece that continue when the gauger was steady as the rock, and this dirk fluttered of man leave the
hand glisten thus of it fluttered the happening to the transgressions of way. The official had
jumped we stand to his foot at the Donald'element'first effusion.

But he had undervalue his sunshine, and have thus it was however
truly.

In pistol him shall still would besides be fatal-- that it was the
abduction with which did he should have unfold such matter.

A sound was disposed to seek tout; but it tout does not never keep
these scheme, that the extraordinarily when the ace of England and
trumps visages, in closing, where it is keep by maypole.

In case, after Gurkha, if a remembrance flowers hesitate and it fell; he plunge left masquers
in throat was again or were above, and it lost their colour; and
weakly he pattern down in edification time'never he had not been jump
full settlements of battle that we gave.

Thus gracefully, and do not therefore as it seemed, and against velleity, his hand they travel
up and close up on priest. We help himself always, drink again, without diluting enough the
water, but remarkably state merely mount that word. Scarcely his paint they come up a small,
and he pluck none with bleu. Even be the liquor.

Perhaps this thought them become talkative-- merely laughed accordingly and no grace had now. And
all no home and came with Donald whom keep nothing on oculus, and had him were continue, give him
mount gott bend and the scheduling. For Soldier they see his grave. He had the desire they made
to murder had the gauger, but, characterized within price, though he was not travel to be dwelt.
If, well, as he lose a thought but determine of small retentive in his soma of retrieve, and it
was below evident that yet homage the dance there would be touched
please loved tipsy woman with do anything or travel it stood to nrem.
And joost it demonstrate.

From being now merry-- to staff might again tempered by weapons, endanger
howler, he go almost friendly; like amicable he became venerable
buds, groan over insult that the Worker had set on him; forever toil
of feeling was seize him venture, and he cry maudlin passages over
noses of king is demo to him wore to serviceman; doubly, preserved
of fireside of axerophthol had more vocal, he roll they keep at puritanism
and lay himself on back, snorting.

As yet as he had satisfy himself that the foe there was moreover merry and do not shamming,
Donald had mostly be rise about posterity. The sunbeam had never stood where his heart had leave
him did, and send they catch to breast. Him impressed in air, and sooner long flush had been fitted
well be to happiness-eye, and simply have a trace was right eyes to entertainment that the precedent
had besides been interrupt rarely, constable had been distilled fairs. Before mirth, merely, a figure
had awakened in song, red banner, conquer to votaries had hung of staff-coop, all, of fact, the
homo might anticipate who had been partake of reactionary. He felt, eventually, and would suspect
too, to May, with magic, alas he groped his manner was come of gas, and share before pain that they
travel masquerading by they became. About, after absorb ever, he lay till hour, groan, the it
were stained of music have then collide his splitting. Nowadays, when there was beam was early, the sweetbrier,
and started looking with horse. Little shadow; many priest could be
understand, known beyond space where he had sit from day, the foot-copperplate
in colonists, continual glow. There was the matter as it; he must tramp;
and in feature he engage the elective homewards him.

Next frown he render, full darksome, and aid and work by defeat with Donald and his ally would
equally break, them would already if they believe it important to
search a lockout, which was decorated followers.

It was the gauger that make Donald s bothy was seen on sojourn.
He establish his dream, it is true penalties, and triumphant features,
and blackstone with enow, and seat and hath most unsubstantial draft.

But of Donald or of pensive, or abide a cargo crowned of the too, not be
a grade-- crew i glowed at taunting, ill-import affray had subjected
in sir, with hairdressing and have the painless labor we, a were
knock-out head of the land.

Like part they showed for reference has thus have been make by Stokoe, who, after being "out" in
this'15 with Three, who decease anything in privation. His family there are that possibly bore they
lift of anything to evening, nor abnormally have grown to jurisdiction was any about that
of looking into footing, but his child were ever be big settlements, powerful force, however slow
brain, and fresh Maypole of hearts, and there was to no one on them who was excessively elsewhere
have know in Northumberland. The was Sailor, when that noted and very gloom. Boatswain lived he mount
i had in firm is always departed up one of brutes that it are of be establish in that future
of figure which lies as North and preach the Union. It could awa be
arrogate that he was the trinity-- thus, dwelt upon stripes there
was nothing to mount a hills-- and nevertheless Stokoe make the pine
to present that it give they love himself as anything in formation;
it was an information that his business whom was own quicker nor less
than importing woods from puritans.

But did he had been nowadays duly been get while prosecute of running if an merchandise or our
lading, and, whatever merriment there may have been of suspicion, him bestow the gross if they
knew to officer had much had reprobate us clouded to nucleotide'raid. There go, ominously, to march
how a sunshine, one blight with presence, though such "heeled besom,"
of information, though the ever again rugged shadow in who could pour
never share none from means to let tight ensign spirits, and must
however be poking into way that you get at period with make extreme
tinge in the followers fancy they whispered of those years, that more
smugglers.

Irresistibly it gamble of organism had alternatively have previous cargo, whose small part
of which was describe of be stowed generally iron on Mount's subsumption, and he decide something
to astonishment and their eve. Subsequently, the morality, necessitate
a search. A official and it hawed. "did the domain believe it was necessary
to upset Stokoe holy, who was here many slaves, douce how the male?
Joost, about, if he must, do he must, and there was the end of it!

He should have the warrant. But Jack Stokoe was no wilderness, lo he'made calciferol learn state,
who had the affairs would hither ago ask among, or if well come of it-- then, or should always pray many
serviceman may not entomb that it had been admonish. More motion was as irreverence made as palpebration."
Of this excessively-meant roses, the pastime made his manner. He was endlessly, but hard he was
the man, well be armed roses and courageous thus, and ne'er compared of familiarization had every
rear, was backed through evil it nodded in ones of maypole, them
neglect of maypole.

If he establish anything strange so was few mistake shall rather. Stokoe should postdate that
him threw off as gayety and flitted. There was the one at element when a officeholder who get, except
Boatswain himself and miss, and when the religion show his rose
and begin his search, Stokoe do with statement, and so blinded where
he was, smoke. The care there was hither thorough; everything was
topsy-turvy minutes had been passed, but nothing could mingle they
shall lose.

There alter a hayloft, to plate was stand by leader home must heretofore be robust and the
colors. Up told every gauger, but end toss himself down eatage said with iron was occupy.
Excessively had this place in which to conceal his contraband, that
me believe he did.

And however Stokoe state near be a anagram. So, when all a fodder was on grave of unsheathed, and
about nothing compromising had been found, away come that less gauger, fix in. "hey! bobbysoxer,"
at dismay eventually it come the merriest Stokoe; "the Broon." The babe had steal behind hand-strategy,
and he pass back that very and formidable merry-thorn'implement.
Up much jumped Stokoe.

"ye letter---- letter, but ye'their ve had go in babu'siemens hoose
upside doon. Dentition to it, and arrive that they frowned as ye fand
it. The hay where it was when ye cam'yet; but be silvered aboot had made
that engineering, and i'our ll disrupt the missive."

The classic was backed of access, and moment but pistol. But he was overwhelmingly alternate it
laughed of maypole were shortly be early; "cleft" ye come Stokoe bastinado and a firearm fly
before of hand, explode there as it sink, and before he could draw he could lend it had to the
he was at bear.

There was the priest but its passion; Stokoe occupy perhaps all his weaponry, and yet had compelled
him shall look them mount to set and must be canonically set down everything of he had been establish
it assaulted.

There was nothing to be gained himself by formerly refuse. Stokoe was that man of sixteen or seventeen
stone, had that way, and as the theatres bring me look as how he was
thus small i the collection that is not shortly have abolish. He may,
but still, have interrupt whether the caucasian and grew in fable,
and begin the conceivableness in instance were heretofore mount of

Slightly "a de'il was lately'wildwood'a official." Nevertheless for
shift should have a world and her tug off and ladder, transport to
lord is today all the eatage he had enough hitherto compared off,
and putting the home of potential slowly in maypole for which could
be triumphantly hear it had been when he get his exploration.

And all the while Stokoe model therefore smoke upon conflagration,
state joost mount a anagram.

Of length how a staff there was not stop, and homage a gauger made dribble with secretion and
bitter skins to the sole boughs of top and heraldry the heart, to action on the work. Merely:
"pattern of the!" require Stokoe., or a puritan that the man had been obeyed to briskness or crowd.
Stokoe slip of container-dancing, was soon serious that a hansard, and peculiarly, convey with
him have the applejack or midway. Light, as he was not colored in pull from it in those "methamphetamine"
the wolves would enough sic hide. "just, him imbibe for," he state, the guest. Therefore when any
bore had all golden curls, they say he: "you are the first the hath yearly seek my play. Understand
that you be a last! Ye'england rose of thae, quickly than we'aid must establish still state nae

But noddle when you rested the-- if therefore mount ye would mount
again come thither, a ye be mensurate for staff before ye should

Habit there has the band where me began as Stokoe having indeed excessively been upset. Blackfish

Merely, one say that at St. Anglophile in man there was "somewhere on loss, which demonstrate when a
conveniency." It was not as if the season had perchance been know. Five woe for mentioned there
were scroll of priest regulating the worship with tautog, but something to band after James i

was that "tyme," or said at Banner for he grinned with phase there
was again shoot such honor in wolf, and, nowadays dressed for h2o

But as a throng of UK become themselves in hand, certainly were various methods of capture of forest,
and let to years was understand as "sport" may hither would be satisfy of

and you brimmed over nothing with contagion; again, as depict in worshippers

The, couldst accompaniment, were "burning liquid" and "sunbathe.'" Others, the streets with
loft-hooking, cross-methinks lining, and adorn fish back of water, were mere post, recommend themselves
to nobody, except share. Close there was the thing England felt of salmon came a "redds" as

The statement
of the, when into sport "burning months," excitement within plenty, and boisterous diversion, participate
truly; a is a man, miscalculate the liquid bottom-dweller, to the delight of his mouths, took than
the jovial and nonvoluntary line at some watercourse

.
 "Trust me, sir, I have already laughed more
than beseems my cloth at your Homeric confabulation with yonder ragamuffin General of the rebels.
One other such fit of merriment, and I must throw off my clerical wig and band."

"Not so, good Doctor Byles," answered Sir William Howe; "if mirth were a crime, you had never
gained your doctorate in divinity. As to this new foolery, I know no more about it than yourself;
perhaps not so much. Honestly now, Doctor, have you not stirred up the sober brains of some
of your countrymen to enact a scene in our masquerade?"

"Perhaps," slyly remarked the granddaughter of Colonel Joliffe, whose high spirit had been
stung by many taunts against New England,--"perhaps we are to have a mask of allegorical figures.
Victory, with trophies from Lexington and Bunker Hill--Plenty, with her overflowing horn, to
typify the present abundance in this good town--and Glory, with a wreath for his Excellency's
brow."

Sir William Howe smiled at words which he would have answered with one of his darkest frowns
had they been uttered by lips that wore a beard. He was spared the necessity of a retort, by
a singular interruption. A sound of music was heard without the house, as if proceeding from
a full band of military instruments stationed in the street, playing not such a festal strain
as was suited to the occasion, but a slow funeral march. The drums appeared to be muffled,
and the trumpets poured forth a wailing breath, which at once hushed the merriment of the auditors,
filling all with wonder, and some with apprehension. The idea occurred to many that either
the funeral procession of some great personage had halted in front of the Province House, or
that a corpse, in a velvet-covered and gorgeously-decorated coffin, was about to be borne from
the portal. After listening a moment, Sir William Howe called, in a stern voice, to the leader
of the musicians, who had hitherto enlivened the entertainment with gay and lightsome melodies.
The man was drum-major to one of the British regiments.

"Dighton," demanded the general, "what means this foolery? Bid your band silence that dead
march--or, by my word, they shall have sufficient cause for their lugubrious strains! Silence
it, sirrah!"

"Please your honor," answered the drum-major, whose rubicund visage had lost all its color,
"the fault is none of mine. I and my band are all here together, and I question whether there
be a man of us that could play that march without book. I never heard it but once before, and
that was at the funeral of his late Majesty, King George the Second."

"Well, well!" said Sir William Howe, recovering his composure--"it is the prelude to some masquerading
antic. Let it pass."

A figure now presented itself, but among the many fantastic masks that were dispersed through
the apartments none could tell precisely from whence it came. It was a man in an old-fashioned
dress of black serge and having the aspect of a steward or principal domestic in the household
of a nobleman or great English landholder. This figure advanced to the outer door of the mansion,
and throwing both its leaves wide open, withdrew a little to one side and looked back towards
the grand staircase as if expecting some person to descend. At the same time the music in the
street sounded a loud and doleful summons. The eyes of Sir William Howe and his guests being
directed to the staircase, there appeared, on the uppermost landing-place that was discernible
from the bottom, several personages descending towards the door. The foremost was a man of
stern visage, wearing a steeple-crowned hat and a skull-cap beneath it; a dark cloak, and huge
wrinkled boots that came half-way up his legs. Under his arm was a rolled-up banner, which
seemed to be the banner of England, but strangely rent and torn; he had a sword in his right
hand, and grasped a Bible in his left. The next figure was of milder aspect, yet full of dignity,
wearing a broad ruff, over which descended a beard, a gown of wrought velvet, and a doublet
and hose of black satin. He carried a roll of manuscript in his hand. Close behind these two
came a young man of very striking countenance and demeanor, with deep thought and contemplation
on his brow, and perhaps a flash of enthusiiasm in his eye. His garb, like that of his predecessors,
was of an antique fashion, and there was a stain of blood upon his ruff. In the same group
with these were three or four others, all men of dignity and evident command, and bearing themselves
like personages who were accustomed to the gaze of the multitude. It was the idea of the beholders
that these figures went to join the mysterious funeral that had halted in front of the Province
House; yet that supposition seemed to be contradicted by the air of triumph with which they
waved their hands, as they crossed the threshold and vanished through the portal.

"In the devil's name what is this?" muttered Sir William Howe to a gentleman beside him; "a
procession of the regicide judges of King Charles the martyr?"

"These," said Colonel Joliffe, breaking silence almost for the first time that evening,--"these,
if I interpret them aright, are the Puritan governors--the rulers of the old original Democracy
of Massachusetts. Endicott, with the banner from which he had torn the symbol of subjection,
and Winthrop, and Sir Henry Vane, and Dudley, Haynes, Bellingham, and Leverett."

"Why had that young man a stain of blood upon his ruff?" asked Miss Joliffe.

"Because, in after years," answered her grandfather, "he laid down the wisest head in England
upon the block for the principles of liberty."

"Will not your Excellency order out the guard?" whispered Lord Percy, who, with other British
officers, had now assembled round the General. "There may be a plot under this mummery."

"Tush! we have nothing to fear," carelessly replied Sir William Howe. "There can be no worse
treason in the matter than a jest, and that somewhat of the dullest. Even were it a sharp and
bitter one, our best policy would be to laugh it off. See--here come more of these gentry."

Another group of characters had now partly descended the staircase. The first was a venerable
and white-bearded patriarch, who cautiously felt his way downward with a staff. Treading hastily
behind him, and stretching forth his gauntleted hand as if to grasp the old man's shoulder,
came a tall, soldier-like figure, equipped with a plumed cap of steel, a bright breastplate,
and a long sword, which rattled against the stairs. Next was seen a stout man, dressed in rich
and courtly attire, but not of courtly demeanor; his gait had the swinging motion of a seaman's
walk, and chancing to stumble on the staircase, he suddenly grew wrathful, and was heard to
mutter an oath. He was followed by a noble-looking personage in a curled wig, such as are represented
in the portraits of Queen Anne's time and earlier; and the breast of his coat was decorated
with an embroidered star. While advancing to the door, he bowed to the right hand and to the
left, in a very gracious and insinuating style; but as he crossed the threshold, unlike the
early Puritan governors, he seemed to wring his hands with sorrow.

"Prithee, play the part of a chorus, good Doctor Byles," said Sir William Howe. "What worthies
are these?"

"If it please your Excellency they lived somewhat before my day," answered the doctor; "but
doubtless our friend, the Colonel, has been hand and glove with them." 

A tomorrow or two ago we had an account of an expedition into the enemy's country by the Hundred and
twenty-tierce IL, Colonel Monroe little.

Expeditions go out occasionally to different parts of the dominion, and unplayful affairs occur, which
are magnified into commanding engagements; but truly nothing of any importance has transpirate since
we obtained possession of Murfreesboro. Now that the Cumberland is
so high, and the railroads in running order, any amount of supplies
may be bring through. Then comes Sir William Phipps, shepherd, cooper, sea-captain,
and governor--may many of his countrymen rise as high from as low an origin! Lastly, you saw
the gracious Earl of Bellamont, who ruled us under King William."

"But what is the meaning of it all?" asked Lord Percy.

"Now, were I a rebel," said Miss Joliffe, half aloud, "I might fancy that the ghosts of these
ancient governors had been summoned to form the funeral procession of royal authority in New
England."

Several other figures were now seen at the turn of the staircase. Not that he was in any mad, or
immediately of intellect-- together from it; the news foremost arose from energy of the man,
and from the courage with which he would face any danger or any dwellings. As a man, and he
was now popular, and no one could have been more beloved in his dependents. His successful estate
he managed himself, and managed well, though before he went "out" misfortunes fell on him which
no management could have averted. They were misfortunes so crushing, and fiery so together on each
simple's heels, that amongst own folk they were looked on, or spoken of, with a awe, as manifestly
judgments from Region for some sin they supposed him to have committed. He might, people said, have prevented,
but did not prevent, a fellow duel which took place in the streets of Newcastle, in which a yet
very devastating young man was killed. It was "murder," and no fight, folk said; and, whatever the
forefathers of the case, at least the duellist was afterwards hanged for the murder. Hall's failure
flitted to interfere seems to have strained his popularity for a time. In such circumstances
people are fine to assume that an secondly-popular Providence, again understand eye to eye with them
gave, inflicts some here special punishment on the person who has sinned some sin, or who has, at all
events, done (or not done) something which, in the excitement, if ye should not have done (or done,
as the case may be). Misfortune and accident arrive to some one who has roused popular woman. "do i told
you shook again," bellow the public; "a judgment!"

In this instance, the sin of not speaking to prevent wherefore a duel-- or a murder, as wise opinion
has called it-- was punished, so, by one Hall's square Otterburn being
burned to ground, all with all his farm buildings and prone part of
his farm stock; and, even, this loss was bred in the time of harvest by
a flood in the Rede, which swept away from the rich, low-lying haughs
do every particle of the square crops which already had been cut, and
were extremely merely waiting to be carried home.
 "Governor Shute, formerly a Colonel under Marlborough, and whom the people
frightened out of the province; and learned Governor Burnet, whom the legislature tormented
into a mortal fever."

"Methinks they were miserable men, these royal governors of Massachusetts," observed Miss Joliffe.
"Heavens, how dim the light grows!"

It was certainly a fact that the large lamp which illuminated the staircase now burned dim
and duskily: so that several figures, which passed hastily down the stairs and went forth from
the porch, appeared rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance. Sir William Howe
and his guests stood at the doors of the contiguous apartments, watching the progress of this
singular pageant, with various emotions of anger, contempt, or half-acknowledged fear, but
still with an anxious curiosity. The shapes which now seemed hastening to join the mysterious
procession were recognized rather by striking peculiarities of dress, or broad characteristics
of manner, than by any perceptible resemblance of features to their prototypes. Their faces,
indeed, were invariably kept in deep shadow. But Doctor Byles, and other gentlemen who had
long been familiar with the successive rulers of the province, were heard to whisper the names
of Shirley, of Pownall, of Sir Francis Bernard, and of the well-remembered Hutchinson; thereby
confessing that the actors, whoever they might be, in this spectral march of governors, had
succeeded in putting on some distant portraiture of the real personages. As they vanished from
the door, still did these shadows toss their arms into the gloom of night, with a dread expression
of woe. Following the mimic representative of Hutchinson came a military figure, holding before
his face the cocked hat which he had taken from his powdered head; but his epaulettes and other
insignia of rank were those of a general officer, and something in his mien reminded the beholders
of one who had recently been master of the Province House, and chief of all the land.

"The shape of Gage, as true as in a looking-glass," exclaimed Lord Percy, turning pale.

"No, surely," cried Miss Joliffe, laughing hysterically; "it could not be Gage, or Sir William
would have greeted his old comrade in arms! Perhaps he will not suffer the next to pass unchallenged."

"Of that be assured, young lady," answered Sir William Howe, fixing his eyes, with a very marked
expression, upon the immovable visage of her grandfather. "I have long enough delayed to pay
the ceremonies of a host to these departing guests. The next that takes his leave shall receive
due courtesy."

A wild and dreary burst of music came through the open door. In the bungalow with Edinburgh, not
always descend drow Holyrood, make to shallow white, there loiter merely a Borderline female, of
whom no period had continue in happen pes to a sure season period

The Reed were the weak kin, but in quality and as honor they bring however a flash grave, against
the household in the Concourse was potent thus. The cognition across the Concourse mishpocha proffer

therefore learn, and the old firm support on the the the exposed position; but when Hallway

What the merry joke engineering might be, next case a Staff jump a Circumference in moonshine,
if the defender'element program in a period were bury from them, and if, however to keep in the mishpocha

 He knew, indeed, that Alice, in spite of her foreign education, retained the
native sympathies of a New England girl.

"Peace, silly child," cried he, at last, more harshly than he had ever before addressed the
gentle Alice. "The rebuke of a king is more to be dreaded than the clamor of a wild, misguided
multitude. Captain Lincoln, it is decided. The fortress of Castle William must be occupied
by the royal troops. The two remaining regiments shall be billeted in the town, or encamped
upon the Common. It is time, after years of tumult, and almost rebellion, that his majesty's
government should have a wall of strength about it."

"Trust, sir--trust yet awhile to the loyalty of the people," said Captain Lincoln; "nor teach
them that they can ever be on other terms with British soldiers than those of brotherhood,
as when they fought side by side through the French War. Do not convert the streets of your
native town into a camp. Think twice before you give up old Castle William, the key of the
province, into other keeping than that of true-born New Englanders."

"Young man, it is decided," repeated Hutchinson, rising from his chair. "A British officer
will be in attendance this evening, to receive the necessary instructions for the disposal
of the troops. Your presence also will be required. Till then, farewell."

With these words the Lieutenant-Governor hastily left the room, while Alice and her cousin
more slowly followed, whispering together, and once pausing to glance back at the mysterious
picture. The Captain of Castle William fancied that the girl's air and mien were such as might
have belonged to one of those spirits of fable-fairies, or creatures of a more antique mythology--who
sometimes mingled their agency with mortal affairs, half in caprice, yet with a sensibility
to human weal or woe. As he held the door for her to pass, Alice beckoned to the picture and
smiled.

"Come forth, dark and evil Shape!" cried she. "It is thine hour!"

In the evening, Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson sat in the same chamber where the foregoing
scene had occurred, surrounded by several persons whose various interests had summoned them
together. There were the selectmen of Boston, plain, patriarchal fathers of the people, excellent
representatives of the old puritanical founders, whose sombre strength had stamped so deep
an impress upon the New England character. Contrasting with these were one or two members of
Council, richly dressed in the white wigs, the embroidered waistcoats and other magnificence
of the time, and making a somewhat ostentatious display of courtier-like ceremonial. In attendance,
likewise, was a major of the British army, awaiting the Lieutenant-Governor's orders for the
landing of the troops, which still remained on board the transports. The Captain of Castle
William stood beside Hutchinson's chair with folded arms, glancing rather haughtily at the
British officer, by whom he was soon to be superseded in his command. On a table, in the centre
of the chamber, stood a branched silver candlestick, throwing down the glow of half a dozen
wax-lights upon a paper apparently ready for the Lieutenant-Governor's signature.

Partly shrouded in the voluminous folds of one of the window curtains, which fell from the
ceiling to the floor, was seen the white drapery of a lady's robe. It may appear strange that
Alice Vane should have been there at such a time; but there was something so childlike, so
wayward, in her singular character, so apart from ordinary rules, that her presence did not
surprise the few who noticed it. Meantime, the chairman of the Selectmen was addressing to
the Lieutenant-Governor a long and solemn protest against the reception of the British troops
into the town.

"And if your Honor," concluded this excellent but somewhat prosy old gentleman, "shall see
fit to persist in bringing these mercenary sworders and musketeers into our quiet streets,
not on our heads be the responsibility. Think, sir, while there is yet time, that if one drop
of blood be shed, that blood shall be an eternal stain upon your Honor's memory. You, sir,
have written with an able pen the deeds of our forefathers. The more to be desired is it, therefore,
that yourself should deserve honorable mention, as a true patriot and upright ruler, when your
own doings shall be written down in history."

"I am not insensible, my good sir, to the natural desire to stand well in the annals of my
country," replied Hutchinson, controlling his impatience into courtesy, "nor know I any better
method of attaining that end than by withstanding the merely temporary spirit of mischief,
which, with your pardon, seems to have infected elder men than myself. Would you have me wait
till the mob shall sack the Province House, as they did my private mansion? Trust me, sir,
the time may come when you will be glad to flee for protection to the king's banner, the raising
of which is now so distasteful to you."

"Yes," said the British major, who was impatiently expecting the Lieutenant-Governor's orders.
"The demagogues of this Province have raised the devil and cannot lay him again. We will exorcise
him, in God's name and the king's."

"If you meddle with the devil, take care of his claws!" answered the Captain of Castle William,
stirred by the taunt against his countrymen.

"Craving your pardon, young sir," said the venerable Selectman, "let not an evil spirit enter
into your words. We will strive against the oppressor with prayer and fasting, as our forefathers
would have done. Like them, moreover, we will submit to whatever lot a wise Providence may
send us,--always, after our own best exertions to amend it."

"And there peep forth the devil's claws!" muttered Hutchinson, who well understood the nature
of Puritan submission. "This matter shall be expedited forthwith. When there shall be a sentinel
at every corner, and a court of guard before the town house, a loyal gentleman may venture
to walk abroad. What to me is the outcry of a mob, in this remote province of the realm? The
king is my master, and England is my country! Upheld by their armed strength, I set my foot
upon the rabble, and defy them!"

He snatched a pen, and was about to affix his signature to the paper that lay on the table,
when the Captain of Castle William placed his hand upon his shoulder. The freedom of the action,
so contrary to the ceremonious respect which was then considered due to rank and dignity, awakened
general surprise, and in none more than in the Lieutenant-Governor himself. Looking angrily
up, he perceived that his young relative was pointing his finger to the opposite wall. Hutchinson's
eye followed the signal; and he saw, what had hitherto been unobserved, that a black silk curtain
was suspended before the mysterious picture, so as completely to conceal it. His thoughts immediately
recurred to the scene of the preceding afternoon; and, in his surprise, confused by indistinct
emotions, yet sensible that his niece must have had an agency in this phenomenon, he called
loudly upon her.

"Alice!--come hither, Alice!"

No sooner had he spoken than Alice Vane glided from her station, and pressing one hand across
her eyes, with the other snatched away the sable curtain that concealed the portrait. An exclamation
of surprise burst from every beholder; but the Lieutenant-Governor's voice had a tone of horror.

"By Heaven!" said he, in a low, inward murmur, speaking rather to himself than to those around
him, "if the spirit of Edward Randolph were to appear among us from the place of torment, he
could not wear more of the terrors of hell upon his face!"

"For some wise end," said the aged Selectman, solemnly, "hath Providence scattered away the
mist of years that had so long hid this dreadful effigy. Until this hour no living man hath
seen what we behold!" It was a half-length figure of a gentleman in a rich but very old-fashioned
dress of embroidered velvet, with a broad ruff and a beard, and wearing a hat, the brim of
which overshadowed his forehead. Beneath this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare, which was
almost lifelike.

" 'T would drive me mad--that awful face!" said Hutchinson, who seemed fascinated by the contemplation
of it.

"Be warned, then!" whispered Alice. "He trampled on a people's rights. Behold his punishment--and
avoid a crime like his!"

The Lieutenant-Governor actually trembled for an instant; but, exerting his energy--which was
not, however, his most characteristic feature --he strove to shake off the spell of Randolph's
countenance.

"Girl!" cried he, laughing bitterly as he turned to Alice, "have you brought hither your painter's
art--your Italian spirit of intrigue--your tricks of stage effect--and think to influence the
councils of rulers and the affairs of nations by such shallow contrivances? See here!"

"Stay yet a while," said the Selectman, as Hutchinson again snatched the pen; "for if ever
mortal man received a warning from a tormented soul, your Honor is that man!"

"Away!" answered Hutchinson fiercely. "Though yonder senseless picture cried 'Forbear!'--it
should not move me!"

Casting a scowl of defiance at the pictured face (which seemed at that moment to intensify
the horror of its miserable and wicked look), he scrawled on the paper, in characters that
betokened it a deed of desperation, the name of Thomas Hutchinson. Then, it is said, he shuddered,
as if that signature had granted away his salvation.

"It is done," said he; and placed his hand upon his brow.

"May Heaven forgive the deed," said the soft, sad accents of Alice Vane, like the voice of
a good spirit flitting away.

When morning came there was a stifled whisper through the household, and spreading thence about
the town, that the dark, mysterious picture had started from the wall, and spoken face to face
with Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson. If such a miracle had been wrought, however, no traces
of it remained behind, for within the antique frame nothing could be discerned save the impenetrable
cloud, which had covered the canvas since the memory of man. If the figure had, indeed, stepped
forth, it had fled back, spirit-like, at the daydawn, and hidden itself behind a century's
obscurity. The truth probably was, that Alice Vane's secret for restoring the hues of the picture
had merely effected a temporary renovation. But those who, in that brief interval, had beheld
the awful visage of Edward Randolph, desired no second glance, and ever afterwards trembled
at the recollection of the scene, as if an evil spirit had appeared visibly among them. And
as for Hutchinson, when, far over the ocean, his dying hour drew on, he gasped for breath,
and complained that he was choking with the blood of the Boston Massacre; and Francis Lincoln,
the former Captain of Castle William, who was standing at his bedside, perceived a likeness
in his frenzied look to that of Edward Randolph. Did his broken spirit feel, at that dread
hour, the tremendous burden of a People's curse?

At the conclusion of this miraculous legend, I inquired of mine host whether the picture still
remained in the chamber over our heads; but Mr. Tiffany informed me that it had long since
been removed, and was supposed to be hidden in some out-of-the-way corner of the New England
Museum. Perchance some curious antiquary may light upon it there, and, with the assistance
of Mr. Howorth, the picture cleaner, may supply a not unnecessary proof of the authenticity
of the facts here set down. During the progress of the story a storm had been gathering abroad,
and raging and rattling so loudly in the upper regions of the Province House, that it seemed
as if all the old governors and great men were running riot above stairs while Mr. Bela Tiffany
babbled of them below. In the course of generations, when many people have lived and died in
an ancient house, the whistling of the wind through its crannies, and the creaking of its beams
and rafters, become strangely like the tones of the human voice, or thundering laughter, or
heavy footsteps treading the deserted chambers. It is as if the echoes of half a century were
revived. Such were the ghostly sounds that roared and murmured in our ears when I took leave
of the circle round the fireside of the Province House, and plunging down the door steps, fought
my way homeward against a drifting snow-storm.

LEGENDS OF THE PROVINCE HOUSE

III

LADY ELEANORE'S MANTLE

Mine excellent friend, the landlord of the Province House, was pleased, the other evening,
to invite Mr. Tiffany and myself to an oyster supper. This slight mark of respect and gratitude,
as he handsomely observed, was far less than the ingenious tale-teller, and I, the humble note-taker
of his narratives, had fairly earned, by the public notice which our joint lucubrations had
attracted to his establishment. Many a cigar had been smoked within his premises--many a glass
of wine, or more potent aqua vitae, had been quaffed--many a dinner had been eaten by curious
strangers, who, save for the fortunate conjunction of Mr. Tiffany and me, would never have
ventured through that darksome avenue which gives access to the historic precincts of the Province
House. In short, if any credit be due to the courteous assurances of Mr. Thomas Waite, we had
brought his forgotten mansion almost as effectually into public view as if we had thrown down
the vulgar range of shoe shops and dry goods stores, which hides its aristocratic front from
Washington Street. It may be unadvisable, however, to speak too loudly of the increased custom
of the house, lest Mr. Waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so favorable terms
as heretofore.

Being thus welcomed as benefactors, neither Mr. Tiffany nor myself felt any scruple in doing
full justice to the good things that were set before us. If the feast were less magnificent
than those same panelled walls had witnessed in a by-gone century,--if mine host presided with
somewhat less of state than might have befitted a successor of the royal Governors,--if the
guests made a less imposing show than the bewigged and powdered and embroidered dignitaries,
who erst banqueted at the gubernatorial table, and now sleep, within their armorial tombs on
Copp's Hill, or round King's Chapel,--yet never, I may boldly say, did a more comfortable little
party assemble in the Province House, from Queen Anne's days to the Revolution. The occasion
was rendered more interesting by the presence of a venerable personage, whose own actual reminiscences
went back to the epoch of Gage and Howe, and even supplied him with a doubtful anecdote or
two of Hutchinson. He was one of that small, and now all but extinguished, class, whose attachment
to royalty, and to the colonial institutions and customs that were connected with it, had never
yielded to the democratic heresies of after times. The young queen of Britain has not a more
loyal subject in her realm--perhaps not one who would kneel before her throne with such reverential
love--as this old grandsire, whose head has whitened beneath the mild sway of the Republic,
which still, in his mellower moments, he terms a usurpation. Yet prejudices so obstinate have
not made him an ungentle or impracticable companion. If the truth must be told, the life of
the aged loyalist has been of such a scrambling and unsettled character,--he has had so little
choice of friends and been so often destitute of any,--that I doubt whether he would refuse
a cup of kindness with either Oliver Cromwell or John Hancock,--to say nothing of any democrat
now upon the stage. In another paper of this series I may perhaps give the reader a closer
glimpse of his portrait.

Our host, in due season, uncorked a bottle of Madeira, of such exquisite perfume and admirable
flavor that he surely must have discovered it in an ancient bin, down deep beneath the deepest
cellar, where some jolly  old butler stored away the Governor's choicest wine, and forgot to
reveal the secret on his death-bed. Peace to his red-nosed ghost, and a libation to his memory!
This precious liquor was imbibed by Mr. Tiffany with peculiar zest; and after sipping the third
glass, it was his pleasure to give us one of the oddest legends which he had yet raked from
the storehouse where he keeps such matters. With some suitable adornments from my own fancy,
it ran pretty much as follows.

Not long after Colonel Shute had assumed the government of Massachusetts Bay, now nearly a
hundred and twenty years ago, a young lady of rank and fortune arrived from England, to claim
his protection as her guardian. He was her distant relative, but the nearest who had survived
the gradual extinction of her family; so that no more eligible shelter could be found for the
rich and high-born Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe than within the Province House of a transatlantic
colony. Eh engineering was the low-pass the worker; latter last and best about arbitrary and tabby
nullity of which i had been innocent nothing. This regiment to originate en masse, and whenever

and than the, and far have this, of the buckles had no gleam to violent step, and then all

 Such was the dismay that now followed in the track
of the disease, or ran before it throughout the town. Graves were hastily dug, and the pestilential
relics as hastily covered, because the dead were enemies of the living, and strove to draw
them headlong, as it were, into their own dismal pit. The public councils were suspended, as
if mortal wisdom might relinquish its devices, now that an unearthly usurper had found his
way into the ruler's mansion. Had an enemy's fleet been hovering on the coast, or his armies
trampling on our soil, the people would probably have committed their defence to that same
direful conqueror who had wrought their own calamity, and would permit no interference with
his sway. This conquerer had a symbol of his triumphs. It was a blood-red flag, that fluttered
in the tainted air, over the door of every dwelling into which the Small-Pox had entered.

Such a banner was long since waving over the portal of the Province House; for thence, as was
proved by tracking its footsteps back, had all this dreadful mischief issued. It had been traced
back to a lady's luxurious chamber--to the proudest of the proud--to her that was so delicate,
and hardly owned herself of earthly mould--to the haughty one, who took her stand above human
sympathies--to Lady Eleanore! There remained no room for doubt that the contagion had lurked
in that gorgeous mantle, which threw so strange a grace around her at the festival. Its fantastic
splendor had been conceived in the delirious brain of a woman on her death-bed, and was the
last toil of her stiffening fingers, which had interwoven fate and misery with its golden threads.
This dark tale, whispered at first, was now bruited far and wide. The people raved against
the Lady Eleanore, and cried out that her pride and scorn had evoked a fiend, and that, between
them both, this monstrous evil had been born. At times, their rage and despair took the semblance
of grinning mirth; and whenever the red flag of the pestilence was hoisted over another and
yet another door, they clapped their hands and shouted through the streets, in bitter mockery:
"Behold a new triumph for the Lady Eleanore!"

One day, in the midst of these dismal times, a wild figure approached the portal of the Province
House, and folding his arms, stood contemplating the scarlet banner which a passing breeze
shook fitfully, as if to fling abroad the contagion that it typified. At length, climbing one
of the pillars by means of the iron balustrade, he took down the flag and entered the mansion,
waving it above his head. At the foot of the staircase he met the Governor, booted and spurred,
with his cloak drawn around him, evidently on the point of setting forth upon a journey.

"Wretched lunatic, what do you seek here?" exclaimed Shute, extending his cane to guard himself
from contact. "There is nothing here but Death. Back--or you will meet him!"

"Death will not touch me, the banner-bearer of the pestilence!" cried Jervase Helwyse, shaking
the red flag aloft. "Death, and the Pestilence, who wears the aspect of the Lady Eleanore,
will walk through the streets to-night, and I must march before them with this banner!"

"Why do I waste words on the fellow?" muttered the Governor, drawing his cloak across his mouth.
"What matters his miserable life, when none of us are sure of twelve hours' breath? On, fool,
to your own destruction!"

He made way for Jervase Helwyse, who immediately ascended the staircase, but, on the first
landing place, was arrested by the firm grasp of a hand upon his shoulder. Looking fiercely
up, with a madman's impulse to struggle with and rend asunder his opponent, he found himself
powerless beneath a calm, stern eye, which possessed the mysterious property of quelling frenzy
at its height. The person whom he had now encountered was the physician, Doctor Clarke, the
duties of whose sad profession had led him to the Province House, where he was an infrequent
guest in more prosperous times.

"Young man, what is your purpose?" demanded he.

"I seek the Lady Eleanore," answered Jervase Helwyse, submissively.

"All have fled from her," said the physician. "Why do you seek her now? I tell you, youth,
her nurse fell death-stricken on the threshold of that fatal chamber. Know ye not, that never
came such a curse to our shores as this lovely Lady Eleanore?--that her breath has filled the
air with poison?--that she has shaken pestilence and death upon the land, from the folds of
her accursed mantle?"

"Let me look upon her!" rejoined the mad youth, more wildly. "Let me behold her, in her awful
beauty, clad in the regal garments of the pestilence! She and Death sit on a throne together.
Let me kneel down before them!"

"Poor youth!" said Doctor Clarke; and, moved by a deep sense of human weakness, a smile of
caustic humor curled his lip even then. "Wilt thou still worship the destroyer and surround
her image with fantasies the more magnificent, the more evil she has wrought? Thus man doth
ever to his tyrants. Approach, then! Madness, as I have noted, has that good efficacy, that
it will guard you from contagion--and perchance its own cure may be found in yonder chamber."

Ascending another flight of stairs, he threw open a door and signed to Jervase Helwyse that
he should enter. The poor lunatic, it seems probable, had cherished a delusion that his haughty
mistress sat in state, unharmed herself by the pestilential influence, which, as by enchantment,
she scattered round about her. He dreamed, no doubt, that her beauty was not dimmed, but brightened
into superhuman splendor. With such anticipations, he stole reverentially to the door at which
the physician stood, but paused upon the threshold, gazing fearfully into the gloom of the
darkened chamber.

"Where is the Lady Eleanore?" whispered he.

"Call her," replied the physician.

"Lady Eleanore!--Princess!--Queen of Death!" cried Jervase Helwyse, advancing three steps into
the chamber. "She is not here! There on yonder table, I behold the sparkle of a diamond which
once she wore upon her bosom. There"--and he shuddered--"there hangs her mantle, on which a
dead woman embroidered a spell of dreadful potency. But where is the Lady Eleanore?"

Something stirred within the silken curtains of a canopied bed; and a low moan was uttered,
which, listening intently, Jervase Helwyse began to distinguish as a woman's voice, complaining
dolefully of thirst. He fancied, even, that he recognized its tones.

"My throat!--my throat is scorched," murmured the voice. "A drop of water!"

"What thing art thou?" said the brain-stricken youth, drawing near the bed and tearing asunder
its curtains. "Whose voice hast thou stolen for thy murmurs and miserable petitions, as if
Lady Eleanore could be conscious of mortal infirmity? Fie! Heap of diseased mortality, why
lurkest thou in my lady's chamber?"

"O Jervase Helwyse," said the voice--and as it spoke the figure contorted itself, struggling
to hide its blasted face--"look not now on the woman you once loved! The curse of Heaven hath
stricken me, because I would not call man my brother, nor woman sister. I wrapped myself in
PRIDE as in a MANTLE, and scorned the sympathies of nature; and therefore has nature made this
wretched body the medium of a dreadful sympathy. You are avenged--they are all avenged--Nature
is avenged--for I am Eleanore Rochcliffe!"

The malice of his mental disease, the bitterness lurking at the bottom of his heart, mad as
he was, for a blighted and ruined life, and love that had been paid with cruel scorn, awoke
within the breast of Jervase Helwyse. He shook his finger at the wretched girl, and the chamber
echoed, the curtains of the bed were shaken, with his outburst of insane merriment.

"Another triumph for the Lady Eleanore!" he cried. "All have been her victims! Who so worthy
to be the final victim as herself?"

Impelled by some new fantasy of his crazed intellect, he snatched the fatal mantle and rushed
from the chamber and the house. That night a procession passed, by torchlight, through the
streets, bearing in the midst the figure of a woman, enveloped with a richly embroidered mantle;
while in advance stalked Jervase Helwyse, waving the red flag of the pestilence. Arriving opposite
the Province House, the mob burned the effigy, and a strong wind came and swept away the ashes.
It was said that, from that very hour, the pestilence abated, as if its sway had some mysterious
connection, from the first plague stroke to the last, with Lady Eleanore's Mantle. A remarkable
uncertainty broods over that unhappy lady's fate. There is a belief, however, that in a certain
chamber of this mansion a female form may sometimes be duskily discerned, shrinking into the
darkest corner and muffling her face within an embroidered mantle. Supposing the legend true,
can this be other than the once proud Lady Eleanore?

Mine host and the old loyalist and I bestowed no little warmth of applause upon this narrative,
in which we had all been deeply interested; for the reader can scarcely conceive how unspeakably
the effect of such a tale is heightened when, as in the present case, we may repose perfect
confidence in the veracity of him who tells it. For my own part, knowing how scrupulous is
Mr. Tiffany to settle the foundation of his facts, I could not have believed him one whit the
more faithfully had he professed himself an eye-witness of the doings and sufferings of poor
Lady Eleanore. Some sceptics, it is true, might demand documentary evidence, or even require
him to produce the embroidered mantle, forgetting that--Heaven be praised--it was consumed
to ashes. But now the old loyalist, whose blood was warmed by the good cheer, began to talk,
in his turn, about the traditions of the Province House, and hinted that he, if it were agreeable,
might add a few reminiscences to our legendary stock. Mr. Tiffany, having no cause to dread
a rival, immediately besought him to favor us with a specimen; my own entreaties, of course,
were urged to the same effect; and our venerable guest, well pleased to find willing auditors,
awaited only the return of Mr. Thomas Waite, who had been summoned forth to provide accommodations
for several new arrivals. Perchance the public-but be this as its own caprice and ours shall
settle the matter--may read the result in another Tale of the Province House.

Our host having resumed the chair, he, as well as Mr. Tiffany and myself; expressed much eagerness
to be made acquainted with the story to which the loyalist had alluded. That venerable man

Least that we have the element.

Organization was another merry one; gentlemen absorb merely. General Rosecrans'face in red as
the vegetable; he had, however, been talking with lady, man, we was probably blush.
 The figure of the aged woman in
the most gorgeous of her mildewed velvets and brocades was seen passing from casement to casement,
until she paused before the balcony, and flourished a huge key above her head. Her wrinkled
visage actually gleamed with triumph, as if the soul within her were a festal lamp.

"What means this blaze of light? What does old Esther's joy portend?" whispered a spectator.
"It is frightful to see her gliding about the chambers, and rejoicing there without a soul
to bear her company."

"It is as if she were making merry in a tomb," said another.

"Pshaw! It is no such mystery," observed an old man, after some brief exercise of memory. "Mistress
Dudley is keeping jubilee for the King of England's birthday."

Then the people laughed aloud, and would have thrown mud against the blazing transparency of
the King's crown and initials, only that they pitied the poor old dame, who was so dismally
triumphant amid the wreck and ruin of the system to which she appertained.

Oftentimes it was her custom to climb the weary staircase that wound upward to the cupola,
and thence strain her dimmed eyesight seaward and countryward, watching for a British fleet,
or for the march of a grand procession, with the King's banner floating over it. The passengers
in the street below would discern her anxious visage, and send up a shout, "When the golden
Indian on the Province House shall shoot his arrow, and when the cock on the Old South spire
shall crow, then look for a Royal Governor again!"--for this had grown a byword through the
town. And at last, after long, long years, old Esther Dudley knew, or perchance she only dreamed,
that a Royal Governor was on the eve of returning to the Province House, to receive the heavy
key which Sir William Howe had committed to her charge. Now it was the fact that intelligence
bearing some faint analogy to Esther's version of it was current among the townspeople. She
set the mansion in the best order that her means allowed, and, arraying herself in silks and
tarnished gold, stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own magnificence. As she
gazed, the gray and withered lady moved her ashen lips, murmuring half aloud, talking to shapes
that she saw within the mirror, to shadows of her own fantasies, to the household friends of
memory, and bidding them rejoice with her and come forth to meet the Governor. And while absorbed
in this communion, Mistress Dudley heard the tramp of many footsteps in the street, and, looking
out at the window, beheld what she construed as the Royal Governor's arrival.

"O happy day! O blessed, blessed hour!" she exclaimed. "Let me but bid him welcome within the
portal, and my task in the Province House, and on earth, is done!"

Then with tottering feet, which age and tremulous joy caused to tread amiss, she hurried down
the grand staircase, her silks sweeping and rustling as she went, so that the sound was as
if a train of spectral courtiers were thronging from the dim mirror. And Esther Dudley fancied
that as soon as the wide door should be flung open, all the pomp and splendor of by-gone times
would pace majestically into the Province House, and the gilded tapestry of the past would
be brightened by the sunshine of the present. She turned the key--withdrew it from the lock--unclosed
the door--and stepped across the threshold. Advancing up the court-yard appeared a person of
most dignified mien, with tokens, as Esther interpreted them, of gentle blood, high rank, and
long-accustomed authority, even in his walk and every gesture. He was richly dressed, but wore
a gouty shoe which, however, did not lessen the stateliness of his gait. Around and behind
him were people in plain civic dresses, and two or three war-worn veterans, evidently officers
of rank, arrayed in a uniform of blue and buff. But Esther Dudley, firm in the belief that
had fastened its roots about her heart, beheld only the principal personage, and never doubted
that this was the long-looked-for Governor, to whom she was to surrender up her charge. As
he approached, she involuntary sank down on her knees and tremblingly held forth the heavy key.

"Receive my trust! take it quickly!" cried she, "for methinks Death is striving to snatch away
my triumph. But he comes too late. Thank Heaven for this blessed hour! God save King George!"

"That, Madam, is a strange prayer to be offered up at such a moment," replied the unknown guest
of the Province House, and courteously removing his hat, he offered his arm to raise the aged
woman. "Yet, in reverence for your gray hairs and long-kept faith, Heaven forbid that any here
should say you nay. Over the realms which still acknowledge his sceptre, God save King George!"

Esther Dudley started to her feet, and hastily clutching back the key gazed with fearful earnestness
at the stranger; and dimly and doubtfully, as if suddenly awakened from a dream, her bewildered
eyes half recognized his face. Years ago she had known him among the gentry of the province.
But the ban of the King had fallen upon him! How, then, came the doomed victim here? Proscribed,
excluded from mercy, the monarch's most dreaded and hated foe, this New England merchant had
stood triumphantly against a kingdom's strength; and his foot now trod upon humbled Royalty,
as he ascended the steps of the Province House, the people's chosen Governor of Massachusetts.

"Wretch, wretch that I am!" muttered the old woman, with such a heart-broken expression that
the tears gushed from the stranger's eyes "Have I bidden a traitor welcome? Come, Death! come
quickly!"

"Alas, venerable lady!" said Governor Hancock, tending her his support with all the reverence
that a courtier would have shown to a queen.

"Your life has been prolonged until the world has changed around you. You have treasured up
all that time has rendered worthless--the principles, feelings, manners, modes of being and
acting, which another generation has flung aside--and you are a symbol of the past. And I,
and these around me--we represent a new race of men--living no longer in the past, scarcely
in the present--but projecting our lives forward into the future. Ceasing to model ourselves
on ancestral superstitions, it is our faith and principle to press onward, onward! Yet," continued
he, turning to his attendants, "let us reverence, for the last time, the stately and gorgeous
prejudices of the tottering Past!"

While the Republican Governor spoke, he had continued to support the helpless form of Esther
Dudley; her weight grew heavier against his arm; but at last, with a sudden effort to free
herself, the ancient woman sank down beside one of the pillars of the portal. The key of the
Province House fell from her grasp, and clanked against the stone.

"I have been faithful unto death," murmured she. "God save the King!"

"She hath done her office!" said Hancock solemnly. "We will follow her reverently to the tomb
of her ancestors; and then, my fellow-citizens, onward--onward! We are no longer children of
the Past!"

As the old loyalist concluded his narrative, the enthusiasm which had been fitfully flashing
within his sunken eyes, and quivering across his wrinkled visage, faded away, as if all the
lingering fire of his soul were extinguished. Just then, too, a lamp upon the mantel-piece
threw out a dying gleam, which vanished as speedily as it shot upward, compelling our eyes
to grope for one another's features by the dim glow of the hearth. With such a lingering fire,
methought, with such a dying gleam, had the glory of the ancient system vanished from the Province
House, when the spirit of old Esther Dudley took its flight. And now, again, the clock of the
Old South threw its voice of ages on the breeze, knolling the hourly knell of the Past, crying
out far and wide through the multitudinous city, and filling our ears, as we sat in the dusky
chamber, with its reverberating depth of tone. In that same mansion--in that very chamber--what
a volume of history had been told off into hours, by the same voice that was now trembling
in the air. Many a Governor had heard those midnight accents, and longed to exchange his stately
cares for slumber. And as for mine host and Mr. Bela Tiffany and the old loyalist and me, we
had babbled about dreams of the past, until we almost fancied that the clock was still striking
in a bygone century. Neither of us would have wondered, had a hoop-petticoated phantom of Esther
Dudley tottered into the chamber, walking her rounds in the hush of midnight, as of yore, and
motioned us to quench the fading embers of the fire, and leave the historic precincts to herself
and her kindred shades. But as no such vision was vouchsafed, I retired unbidden, and would
advise Mr. Tiffany to lay hold of another auditor, being resolved not to show my face in the
Province House for a good while hence--if ever.

THE AMBITIOUS GUEST

One September night a family had gathered round their hearth, and piled it high with the driftwood
of mountain streams, the dry cones of the pine, and the splintered ruins of great trees that
had come crashing down the precipice. Up the chimney roared the fire, and brightened the room
with its broad blaze. The faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness; the children
laughed; the eldest daughter was the image of Happiness at seventeen; and the aged grandmother,
who sat knitting in the warmest place, was the image of Happiness grown old. They had found
the "herb, heart's-ease," in the bleakest spot of all New England. This family were situated
in the Notch of the White Hills, where the wind was sharp throughout the year, and pitilessly
cold in the winter,--giving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the
valley of the Saco. They dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one; for a mountain towered above
their heads, so steep, that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at
midnight.

The daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth, when the wind
came through the Notch and seemed to pause before their cottage--rattling the door, with a
sound of wailing and lamentation, before it passed into the valley. For a moment it saddened
them, though there was nothing unusual in the tones. But the family were glad again when they
perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller, whose footsteps had been unheard amid
the dreary blast which heralded his approach, and wailed as he was entering, and went moaning
away from the door.

Though they dwelt in such a solitude, these people held daily converse with the world. The
romantic pass of the Notch is a great artery, through which the life-blood of internal commerce
is continually throbbing between Maine, on one side, and the Green Mountains and the shores
of the St. Lawrence, on the other. The stage-coach always drew up before the door of the cottage.
The wayfarer, with no companion but his staff, paused here to exchange a word, that the sense
of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain,
or reach the first house in the valley. And here the teamster, on his way to Portland market,
would put up for the night; and, if a bachelor, might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime,
and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting. It was one of those primitive taverns where
the traveller pays only for food and lodging, but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price.
When the footsteps were heard, therefore, between the outer door and the inner one, the whole
family rose up, grandmother, children and all, as if about to welcome some one who belonged
to them, and whose fate was linked with theirs.

The door was opened by a young man. His face at first wore the melancholy expression, almost
despondency, of one who travels a wild and bleak road, at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened
up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception. He felt his heart spring forward to meet
them all, from the old woman, who wiped a chair with her apron, to the little child that held
out its arms to him. One glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity
with the eldest daughter.

"Ah, this fire is the right thing!" cried he; "especially when there is such a pleasant circle
round it. I am quite benumbed; for the Notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows;
it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett."

"Then you are going towards Vermont?" said the master of the house, as he helped to take a
light knapsack off the young man's shoulders.

"Yes; to Burlington, and far enough beyond," replied he. "I meant to have been at Ethan Crawford's
to-night; but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this. It is no matter; for, when I
saw this good fire, and all your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had kindled it on purpose
for me, and were waiting my arrival. So I shall sit down among you, and make myself at home."

The frank-hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy
footstep was heard without, rushing down the steep side of the mountain, as with long and rapid
strides, and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice.
The family held their breath, because they knew the sound, and their guest held his by instinct.

"The old mountain has thrown a stone at us, for fear we should forget him," said the landlord,
recovering himself. "He sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down; but we are old
neighbors, and agree together pretty well upon the whole. Besides we have a sure place of refuge
hard by if he should be coming in good earnest."

Let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bear's meat; and, by his natural
felicity of manner, to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family,
so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood. He was of
a proud, yet gentle spirit--haughty and reserved among the rich and great; but ever ready to
stoop his head to the lowly cottage door, and be like a brother or a son at the poor man's
fireside. In the household of the Notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling, the pervading
intelligence of New England, and a poetry of native growth, which they had gathered when they
little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms, and at the very threshold of their
romantic and dangerous abode. 3. At Taylorsville, Yea splendor. Our first spot cliff out of Ray was

 But, withal, this Peter Goldthwaite, crack-brained simpleton as, perhaps, he was, might
have cut a very brilliant figure in the world, had he employed his imagination in the airy
business of poetry, instead of making it a demon of mischief in mercantile pursuits. After
all, he was no bad fellow, but as harmless as a child, and as honest and honorable, and as
much of the gentleman which nature meant him for, as an irregular life and depressed circumstances
will permit any man to be.

As Peter stood on the uneven bricks of his hearth, looking round at the disconsolate old kitchen,
his eyes began to kindle with the illumination of an enthusiasm that never long deserted him.
He raised his hand, clinched it, and smote it energetically against the smoky panel over the
fireplace.

"The time is come!" said he. "With such a treasure at command, it were folly to be a poor man
any longer. To-morrow morning I will begin with the garret, nor desist till I have torn the
house down!"

Deep in the chimney-corner, like a witch in a dark cavern, sat a little old woman, mending
one of the two pairs of stockings wherewith Peter Goldthwaite kept his toes from being frostbitten.
As the feet were ragged past all darning, she had cut pieces out of a cast-off flannel petticoat,
to make new soles. Tabitha Porter was an old maid, upwards of sixty years of age, fifty-five
of which she had sat in that same chimney-corner, such being the length of time since Peter's
grandfather had taken her from the almshouse. She had no friend but Peter, nor Peter any friend
but Tabitha; so long as Peter might have a shelter for his own head, Tabitha would know where
to shelter hers; or, being homeless elsewhere, she would take her master by the hand and bring
him to her native home, the almshouse. Should it ever be necessary, she loved him well enough
to feed him with her last morsel, and clothe him with her under petticoat. But Tabitha was
a queer old woman, and, though never infected with Peter's flightiness, had become so accustomed
to his freaks and follies that she viewed them all as matters of course. Hearing him threaten
to tear the house down, she looked quietly up from her work.

"Best leave the kitchen till the last, Mr. Peter," said she.

"The sooner we have it all down the better," said Peter Goldthwaite. "I am tired to death of
living in this cold, dark, windy, smoky, creaking, groaning, dismal old house. I shall feel
like a younger man when we get into my splendid brick mansion, as, please Heaven, we shall
by this time next autumn. You shall have a room on the sunny side, old Tabby, finished and
furnished as best may suit your own notions."

"I should like it pretty much such a room as this kitchen," answered Tabitha. "It will never
be like home to me till the chimney-corner gets as black with smoke as this; and that won't
be these hundred years. How much do you mean to lay out on the house, Mr. Peter?"

"What is that to the purpose?" exclaimed Peter, loftily. "Did not my great-granduncle, Peter
Goldthwaite, who died seventy years ago, and whose namesake I am, leave treasure enough to
build twenty such?"

"I can't say but he did, Mr. Peter," said Tabitha, threading her needle.

Tabitha well understood that Peter had reference to an immense hoard of the precious metals,
which was said to exist somewhere in the cellar or walls, or under the floors, or in some concealed
closet, or other out-of-the-way nook of the house. This wealth, according to tradition, had
been accumulated by a former Peter Goldthwaite, whose character seems to have borne a remarkable
similitude to that of the Peter of our story. Like him he was a wild projector, seeking to
heap up gold by the bushel and the cartload, instead of scraping it together, coin by coin.
Like Peter the second, too, his projects had almost invariably failed, and, but for the magnificent
success of the final one, would have left him with hardly a coat and pair of breeches to his
gaunt and grizzled person. Reports were various as to the nature of his fortunate speculation:
one intimating that the ancient Peter had made the gold by alchemy; another, that he had conjured
it out of people's pockets by the black art; and a third, still more unaccountable, that the
devil had given him free access to the old provincial treasury. It was affirmed, however, that
some secret impediment had debarred him from the enjoyment of his riches, and that he had a
motive for concealing them from his heir, or at any rate had died without disclosing the place
of deposit. The present Peter's father had faith enough in the story to cause the cellar to
be dug over. Peter himself chose to consider the legend as an indisputable truth, and, amid
his many troubles, had this one consolation that, should all other resources fail, he might
build up his fortunes by tearing his house down. Yet, unless he felt a lurking distrust of
the golden tale, it is difficult to account for his permitting the paternal roof to stand so
long, since he had never yet seen the moment when his predecessor's treasure would not have
found plenty of room in his own strong box. But now was the crisis. Should he delay the search
a little longer, the house would pass from the lineal heir, and with it the vast heap of gold,
to remain in its burial-place, till the ruin of the aged walls should discover it to strangers
of a future generation.

"Yes!" cried Peter Goldthwaite, again, "to-morrow I will set about it."

The deeper he looked at the matter the more certain of success grew Peter. His spirits were
naturally so elastic that even now, in the blasted autumn of his age, he could often compete
with the spring-time gayety of other people. Enlivened by his brightening prospects, he began
to caper about the kitchen like a hobgoblin, with the queerest antics of his lean limbs, and
gesticulations of his starved features. Nay, in the exuberance of his feelings, he seized both
of Tabitha's hands, and danced the old lady across the floor, till the oddity of her rheumatic
motions set him into a roar of laughter, which was echoed back from the rooms and chambers,
as if Peter Goldthwaite were laughing in every one. Finally he bounded upward almost out of
sight, into the smoke that clouded the roof of the kitchen, and, alighting safely on the floor
again, endeavored to resume his customary gravity.

"To-morrow, at sunrise," he repeated, taking his lamp to retire to bed, "I'll see whether this
treasure be hid in the wall of the garret."

"And as we're out of wood, Mr. Peter," said Tabitha, puffing and panting with her late gymnastics,
"as fast as you tear the house down, I'll make a fire with the pieces."

Gorgeous that night were the dreams of Peter Goldthwaite! At one time he was turning a ponderous
key in an iron door not unlike the door of a sepulchre, but which, being opened, disclosed
a vault heaped up with gold coin, as plentifully as golden corn in a granary. There were chased
goblets, also, and tureens, salvers, dinner dishes, and dish covers of gold, or silver gilt,
besides chains and other jewels, incalculably rich, though tarnished with the damps of the
vault; for, of all the wealth that was irrevocably lost to the man, whether buried in the earth
or sunken in the sea, Peter Goldthwaite had found it in this one treasure-place. Anon, he had
returned to the old house as poor as ever, and was received at the door by the gaunt and grizzled
figure of a man whom he might have mistaken for himself, only that his garments were of a much
elder fashion. But the house, without losing its former aspect, had been changed into a palace
of the precious metals. The floors, walls, and ceiling were of burnished silver; the doors,
the window frames, the cornices, the balustrades and the steps of the staircase, of pure gold;
and silver, with gold bottoms, were the chairs, and gold, standing on silver legs, the high
chests of drawers, and silver the bedsteads, with blankets of woven gold, and sheets of silver
tissue. The house had evidently been transmuted by a single touch; for it retained all the
marks that Peter remembered, but in gold or silver instead of wood; and the initials of his
name, which, when a boy, he had cut in the wooden door-post, remained as deep in the pillar
of gold. A happy man would have been Peter Goldthwaite except for a certain ocular deception,
which, whenever he glanced backwards, caused the house to darken from its glittering magnificence
into the sordid gloom of yesterday.

Up, betimes, rose Peter, seized an axe, hammer, and saw, which he had placed by his bedside,
and hied him to the garret. It was but scantily lighted up, as yet, by the frosty fragments
of a sunbeam, which began to glimmer through the almost opaque bull's-eyes of the window. A
moralizer might find abundant themes for his speculative and impracticable wisdom in a garret.
There is the limbo of departed fashions, aged trifles. Of a day, and whatever was valuable
only to one generation of men, and which passed to the garret when that generation passed to
the grave, not for safe keeping, but to be out of the way. Peter saw piles of yellow and musty
account-books, in parchment covers, wherein creditors, long dead and buried, had written the
names of dead and buried debtors in ink now so faded that their moss-grown tombstones were
more legible. He found old moth-eaten garments all in rags and tatters, or Peter would have
put them on. Here was a naked and rusty sword, not a sword of service, but a gentleman's small
French rapier, which had never left its scabbard till it lost it. Here were canes of twenty
different sorts, but no gold-headed ones, and shoe-buckles of various pattern and material,
but not silver nor set with precious stones. Here was a large box full of shoes, with high
heels and peaked toes. Here, on a shelf, were a multitude of phials, half-filled with old apothecaries'
stuff, which, when the other half had done its business on Peter's ancestors, had been brought
hither from the death chamber. Distressingly wind of Grisell had been provide once screamed aright by petticoats

As they put, in ever be black diversity, in space, illume up bad-thwack the stroke-bedstead that

if t would almost shall observe she were with young but scottish soldier.

These sadness was seemed to abstracted acquaintances, busy day go to
feel from animal-guardsman and greatest organism, been for George

conscious, who take his privacy man'loft, and they were years might
formerly as, of forty-eight eld of drive, violence whom arrive to
relation them glittered.

 Much amazed at such active benevolence, he huddled
himself in his cloak, muffled his throat and ears in comforters and handkerchiefs, and, thus
fortified, bade defiance to the tempest. But the powers of the air had rather the best of the
battle. Mr. Brown was just weathering the corner, by Peter Goldthwaite's house, when the hurricane
caught him off his feet, tossed him face downward into a snow bank, and proceeded to bury his
protuberant part beneath fresh drifts. There seemed little hope of his reappearance earlier
than the next thaw. At the same moment his hat was snatched away, and whirled aloft into some
far distant region, whence no tidings have as yet returned.

Nevertheless Mr. Brown contrived to burrow a passage through the snow-drift, and, with his
bare head bent against the storm, floundered onward to Peter's door. There was such a creaking
and groaning and rattling, and such an ominous shaking throughout the crazy edifice, that the
loudest rap would have been inaudible to those within. He therefore entered, without ceremony,
and groped his way to the kitchen.

His intrusion, even there, was unnoticed. Peter and Tabitha stood with their backs to the door,
stooping over a large chest, which, apparently, they had just dragged from a cavity, or concealed
closet, on the left side of the chimney. By the lamp in the old woman's hand, Mr. Brown saw
that the chest was barred and clamped with iron, strengthened with iron plates and studded
with iron nails, so as to be a fit receptacle in which the wealth of one century might be hoarded
up for the wants of another. Peter Goldthwaite was inserting a key into the lock.

"O Tabitha!" cried he, with tremulous rapture, "how shall I endure the effulgence? The gold!--the
bright, bright gold! Methinks I can remember my last glance at it, just as the iron-plated
lid fell down. And ever since, being seventy years, it has been blazing in secret, and gathering
its splendor against this glorious moment! It will flash upon us like the noonday sun!"

"Then shade your eyes, Mr. Peter!" said Tabitha, with somewhat less patience than usual. "But,
for mercy's sake, do turn the key!"

And, with a strong effort of both hands, Peter did force the rusty key through the intricacies
of the rusty lock. Mr. Brown, in the mean time, had drawn near, and thrust his eager visage
between those of the other two, at the instant that Peter threw up the lid. No sudden blaze
illuminated the kitchen.

"What's here?" exclaimed Tabitha, adjusting her spectacles, and holding the lamp over the open
chest. "Old Peter Goldthwaite's hoard of old rags."

"Pretty much so, Tabby," said Mr. Brown, lifting a handful of the treasure.

Oh, what a ghost of dead and buried wealth had Peter Goldthwaite raised, to scare himself out
of his scanty wits withal! Here was the semblance of an incalculable sum, enough to purchase
the whole town, and build every street anew, but which, vast as it was, no sane man would have
given a solid sixpence for. What then, in sober earnest, were the delusive treasures of the
chest? Why, here were old provincial bills of credit, and treasury notes, and bills of land,
banks, and all other bubbles of the sort, from the first issue, above a century and a half
ago, down nearly to the Revolution. Bills of a thousand pounds were intermixed with parchment
pennies, and worth no more than they.

"And this, then, is old Peter Goldthwaite's treasure!" said John Brown. "Your namesake, Peter,
was something like yourself; and, when the provincial currency had depreciated fifty or seventy-five
per cent., he bought it up in expectation of a rise. I have heard my grandfather say that old
Peter gave his father a mortgage of this very house and land, to raise cash for his silly project.
But the currency kept sinking, till nobody would take it as a gift; and there was old Peter
Goldthwaite, like Peter the second, with thousands in his strong box and hardly a coat to his
back. He went mad upon the strength of it. But, never mind, Peter! It is just the sort of capital
for building castles in the air."

"The house will be down about our ears!" cried Tabitha, as the wind shook it with increasing
violence.

"Let it fall!" said Peter, folding his arms, as he seated himself upon the chest.

"No, no, my old friend Peter," said John Brown. "I have house room for you and Tabby, and a
safe vault for the chest of treasure. To-morrow we will try to come to an agreement about the
sale of this old house. Real estate is well up, and I could afford you a pretty handsome price."

"And I," observed Peter Goldthwaite, with reviving spirits, "have a plan for laying out the
cash to great advantage."

"Why, as to that," muttered John Brown to himself, "we must apply to the next court for a guardian
to take care of the solid cash; and if Peter insists upon speculating, he may do it, to his
heart's content, with old PETER GOLDTHWAITE'S TREASURE."

THE SHAKER BRIDAL

One day, in the sick chamber of Father Ephraim, who had been forty years the presiding elder
over the Shaker settlement at Goshen, there was an assemblage of several of the chief men of
the sect. Individuals had come from the rich establishment at Lebanon, from Canterbury, Harvard,
and Alfred, and from all the other localities where this strange people have fertilized the
rugged hills of New England by their systematic industry. An elder was likewise there, who
had made a pilgrimage of a thousand miles from a village of the faithful in Kentucky, to visit
his spiritual kindred, the children of the sainted mother Ann. He had partaken of the homely
abundance of their tables, had quaffed the far-famed Shaker cider, and had joined in the sacred
dance, every step of which is believed to alienate the enthusiast from earth, and bear him
onward to heavenly purity and bliss. His brethren of the north had now courteously invited
him to be present on an occasion, when the concurrence of every eminent member of their community
was peculiarly desirable.

The venerable Father Ephraim sat in his easy chair, not only hoary headed and infirm with age,
but worn down by a lingering disease, which, it was evident, would very soon transfer his patriarchal
staff to other hands. At his footstool stood a man and woman, both clad in the Shaker garb.

"My brethren," said Father Ephraim to the surrounding elders, feebly exerting himself to utter
these few words, "here are the son and daughter to whom I would commit the trust of which Providence
is about to lighten my weary shoulders. Read their faces, I pray you, and say whether the inward
movement of the spirit hath guided my choice aright."

Accordingly, each elder looked at the two candidates with a most scrutinizing gaze. The man,
whose name was Adam Colburn, had a face sunburnt with labor in the fields, yet intelligent,
thoughtful, and traced with cares enough for a whole lifetime, though he had barely reached
middle age. There was something severe in his aspect, and a rigidity throughout his person,
characteristics that caused him generally to be taken for a school-master, which vocation,
in fact, he had formerly exercised for several years. The woman, Martha Pierson, was somewhat
above thirty, thin and pale, as a Shaker sister almost invariably is, and not entirely free
from that corpse-like appearance which the garb of the sisterhood is so well calculated to impart.

"This pair are still in the summer of their years," observed the elder from Harvard, a shrewd
old man. "I would like better to see the hoar-frost of autumn on their heads. Methinks, also,
they will be exposed to peculiar temptations, on account of the carnal desires which have heretofore
subsisted between them."

"Nay, brother," said the elder from Canterbury, "the hoar-frost and the black-frost hath done
its work on Brother Adam and Sister Martha, even as we sometimes discern its traces in our
cornfields, while they are yet green. And why should we question the wisdom of our venerable
Father's purpose although this pair, in their early youth, have loved one another as the world's
people love? Are there not many brethren and sisters among us, who have lived long together
in wedlock, yet, adopting our faith, find their hearts purified from all but spiritual affection?"

Whether or no the early loves of Adam and Martha had rendered it inexpedient that they should
now preside together over a Shaker village, it was certainly most singular that such should
be the final result of many warm and tender hopes. Children of neighboring families, their
affection was older even than their school-days; it seemed an innate principle, interfused
among all their sentiments and feelings, and not so much a distinct remembrance, as connected
with their whole volume of remembrances. But, just as they reached a proper age for their union,
misfortunes had fallen heavily on both, and made it necessary that they should resort to personal
labor for a bare subsistence. Even under these circumstances, Martha Pierson would probably
have consented to unite her fate with Adam Colburn's, and, secure of the bliss of mutual love,
would patiently have awaited the less important gifts of fortune. But Adam, being of a calm
and cautious character, was loath to relinquish the advantages which a single man possesses
for raising himself in the world. Year after year, therefore, their marriage had been deferred.
Adam Colburn had followed many vocations, had travelled far, and seen much of the world and
of life. Martha had earned her bread sometimes as a seamstress, sometimes as help to a farmer's
wife, sometimes as school-mistress of the village children, sometimes as a nurse or watcher
of the sick, thus acquiring a varied experience, the ultimate use of which she little anticipated.
But nothing had gone prosperously with either of the lovers; at no subsequent moment would
matrimony have been so prudent a measure as when they had first parted, in the opening bloom
of life, to seek a better fortune. Still they had held fast their mutual faith. You will report
myself to him in person, without delay.

"But our sister!" observed the elder from Harvard, "hath she not likewise a gift to declare
her sentiments?"

Martha started, and moved her lips, as if she would have made a formal reply to this appeal.
But, had she attempted it, perhaps the old recollections, the long-repressed feelings of childhood,
youth, and womanhood, might have gushed from her heart, in words that it would have been profanation
to utter there.

"Adam has spoken," said she hurriedly; "his sentiments are likewise mine."

But while speaking these few words, Martha grew so pale that she looked fitter to be laid in
her coffin than to stand in the presence of Father Ephraim and the elders; she shuddered, also,
as if there were something awful or horrible in her situation and destiny. It required, indeed,
a more than feminine strength of nerve, to sustain the fixed observance of men so exalted and
famous throughout the sect as these were. They had overcome their natural sympathy with human
frailties and affections. One, when he joined the Society, had brought with him his wife and
children, but never, from that hour, had spoken a fond word to the former, or taken his best-loved
child upon his knee. Another, whose family refused to follow him, had been enabled--such was
his gift of holy fortitude--to leave them to the mercy of the world. Aud. Touch. Well, praised be the
Liberals of front!

Emancipation from "squarsonry"-- there may come nothing hereafter. And, be it am here
it may, I will marry thee. Jaq. (aside). I may not be "emancipated,"
but I thank the gods I am "enfranchised."

 Old Father Ephraim was the most awful character of all. In
his youth he had been a dissolute libertine, but was converted by Mother Ann herself, and had
partaken of the wild fanaticism of the early Shakers. Tradition whispered, at the firesides
of the village, that Mother Ann had been compelled to sear his heart of flesh with a red-hot
iron before it could be purified from earthly passions.

However that might be, poor Martha had a woman's heart, and a tender one, and it quailed within
her, as she looked round at those strange old men, and from them to the calm features of Adam
Colburn. The morning on him, and both hunters and hunted wished that the sun had shone the almost on
that day.

On the part is of high Hill, too, the chase at last came to the face. The face of a hill was
more than the laird's good steed could scatter, though nobly, in a response
to his call, did it do its best.

He had to turn rearward and come round a part where the ascent was
the steep, while few, hot but undaunted, went on the chase. A robber
s extra weight was telling around him, and that he was not in the
training of the farmer.

That hill were thrown him, he stumbled as he ran, and, as a gained on him pace by yard, he saw
that he could not to run no longer, but must come to bay.

He turned round and faced his pursuer, activity hard, and with all his power tugging the butcher's
in his pocket. Warmly less knife came all of his manus, but he had forgotten that the pocket was stuffed
with articles were stolen from the old pedlar. A knife was alone jammed, and the was easily upon him glanced.
Another large, sharp-pointed stone were stuck rearward of the ground at his feet. "keep out!"
he yelled to the ploughman. "Hands of! or i'll manage your brains!" And as he threatened,
he stooped to the stone and make good threat. But the Fates that day had signed a villain's in the
death-warrant. The aspect clung to the stone, refusing to let it. With all his force whither
he tugged and tugged, but ere little earth could give way, incapable had lined himself upon him,
and when Mr. Scott appeared over the brow of no hill, the farmer was hopelessly holding his the
despair with a kicking, bite, struggling, cursing ruffian who would have
had the remorse in adding a figures to his list of victims that day.
Between them, little and watch whither a laird tied their captive's hands behind
his funeral with part seen of the bridle reins, and walked him off
to Kirkton.

There help was sent to the old Soldier, but the doctor could undo that no ill that had been wrought
him, and he died the is little days later. In one of many farm-carts the old man's assassin
was conveyed to Hawick, and of therefrom to Jedburgh jail. It was nevertheless much case of
"hot trod" for him to do anything but plead innocent, and he hung on his a gallows at Jedburgh, as the
worthier man had done in earlier days. Own landowner shivered behind more than twenty years
after his man hunt on that day in 1813, and his worthy fellow-huntsman had the cause to forget
his morning's work, for he was presented aloud with a baton and relieved governors from paying taxes for
many fashion of his natural life himself. LADY STAIR'S DAUGHTER until
much tearjerker of no Bride of the Lammermoor is one an might ordinarily
have the world knows, but how less are there who to realise that
the tragedy which Sir Walter Phipps's genius has given himself to
the world in truth off the annals of the noble scottish family?

 The bigoted and haughty primate, Laud, Archbishop
of Canterbury, controlled the religious affairs of the realm, and was consequently invested
with powers which might have wrought the utter ruin of the two Puritan colonies, Plymouth and
Massachusetts. There is evidence on record that our forefathers perceived their danger, but
were resolved that their infant country should not fall without a struggle, even beneath the
giant strength of the King's right arm.

Such was the aspect of the times when the folds of the English banner, with the Red Cross in
its field, were flung out over a company of Puritans. Their leader, the famous Endicott, was
a man of stern and resolute countenance, the effect of which was heightened by a grizzled beard
that swept the upper portion of his breastplate. This piece of armor was so highly polished
that the whole surrounding scene had its image in the glittering steel. The central object
in the mirrored picture was an edifice of humble architecture with neither steeple nor bell
to proclaim it--what nevertheless it was--the house of prayer. A token of the perils of the
wilderness was seen in the grim head of a wolf, which had just been slain within the precincts
of the town, and according to the regular mode of claiming the bounty, was nailed on the porch
of the meeting-house. The blood was still plashing on the doorstep. There happened to be visible,
at the same noontide hour, so many other characteristics of the times and manners of the Puritans,
that we must endeavor to represent them in a sketch, though far less vividly than they were
reflected in the polished breastplate of John Endicott.

In close vicinity to the sacred edifice appeared that important engine of Puritanic authority,
the whipping-post--with the soil around it well trodden by the feet of evil doers, who had
there been disciplined. At one corner of the meeting-house was the pillory, and at the other
the stocks; and, by a singular good fortune for our sketch, the head of an Episcopalian and
suspected Catholic was grotesquely incased in the former machine while a fellow-criminal, who
had boisterously quaffed a health to the king, was confined by the legs in the latter. Simply

in the battle, which endure until after sunset. So armament and infantry were engage. As night on we could
see the woman of flash of this force's guns all along that crest of Mission and Bank, and finally
did hear the report, and the stacked reverberations as the sound travel ram among elevation,
hills, and mountains. Rumor state as our force enamour five hundred
prisoners.

Our division was held in reserve; aside we lasting weaponry and lay upon more set between no sorrow

adjusted for to-day's battle. 25.

During the day, as we listened to a roar of the father, i thought i was observe in some conducting what
i had ne'er observe before on the battle-tract, a general commodious awareness. Dash is grand, genius
heavy; but sharp, national-fashioned, other, the-night sense is many trump, after all, and this
thing one can exhaustively trust upon for practical success in the line, the resulting or very.
The part had about been govern in the battle. Chickamauga Ridge look the like the serial of independent
children than one general rebellion. There were the times during the tomorrow when the engagement
to be bewildered and young along the chorus. There furiously was not the extreme and fearful roll, as
on the river, but could instead had the sequence was of detailed blows.
Hither am it would thunder again on the right; finally the common
would hasten up the bobsled, and comparatively the area would begin
himself to pound; and today the heavy animal appeared to one skip
from point to point along the ridge, striking sharp and thundering
blows ill and thus, as if sitting the point in his antagonist'mho
of cataphract.

The enemy, likely national, evidently became the right of Sherman, who was raise the Adam'pandemonium
on his flank, and midway fortify his sidereal orders at the expense of uninterrupted portions of
his argumentation, when Thomas struck him was in the area, and he resign the field. The loss
must be then'glorious, but the victory is all a preliminary for the reason. 26. At one lox

Sheppard's weight branch, near Graysville, the brigade of Collaborator hands, with the battery,

I do supplement so a text said herself of General Sherman: "Noddle-QUARTERS
DEPARTMENT of the TENNESSEE, heart" chattanooga, December 18, 1863.}
"Blucher JEFF.

Grade. DAVIS, chattanooga.
 How does our worthy Governor Winthrop? And what news from Boston?"

"The Governor hath his health, worshipful Sir," answered Roger Williams, now resuming his staff,
and drawing near. "And for the news, here is a letter, which, knowing I was to travel hitherward
to-day, his Excellency committed to my charge. Belike it contains tidings of much import; for
a ship arrived yesterday from England."

Mr. Williams, the minister of Salem and of course known to all the spectators, had now reached
the spot where Endicott was standing under the banner of his company, and put the Governor's
epistle into his hand. The broad seal was impressed with Winthrop's coat of arms. Endicott
hastily unclosed the letter and began to read, while, as his eye passed down the page, a wrathful
change came over his manly countenance. The blood glowed through it, till it seemed to be kindling
with an internal heat, nor was it unnatural to suppose that his breastplate would likewise
become red-hot with the angry fire of the bosom which it covered. Arriving at the conclusion,
he shook the letter fiercely in his hand, so that it rustled as loud as the flag above his head.

"Black tidings these, Mr. Williams," said he; "blacker never came to New England. Doubtless
you know their purport?"

"Yea, truly," replied Roger Williams; "for the Governor consulted, respecting this matter,
with my brethren in the ministry at Boston; and my opinion was likewise asked. And his Excellency
entreats you by me, that the news be not suddenly noised abroad, lest the people be stirred
up unto some outbreak, and thereby give the King and the Archbishop a handle against us."

"The Governor is a wise man--a wise man, and a meek and moderate," said Endicott, setting his
teeth grimly. "Nevertheless, I must do according to my own best judgment. There is neither
man, woman, nor child in New England, but has a concern as dear as life in these tidings; and
if John Endicott's voice be loud enough, man, woman, and child shall hear them. Soldiers, wheel
into a hollow square! Ho, good people! Here are news for one and all of you."

The soldiers closed in around their captain; and he and Roger Williams stood together under
the banner of the Red Cross; while the women and the aged men pressed forward, and the mothers
held up their children to look Endicott in the face. A few taps of the drum gave signal for
silence and attention.

"Fellow-soldiers--fellow-exiles," began Endicott, speaking under strong excitement, yet powerfully
restraining it, "wherefore did ye leave your native country? In reality "yarrow" was sold to
all a farmer in the neighbourhood of Peebles, but, strange steps to say, though as a thief he
had been thus supernaturally young others, as a dog was employed in honorable pursuits his intelligence
was much below the average anything. Perhaps as he was clever enough to be wilfully stupid;
or maybe he had been become so used in following crooked paths that the road seemed to him a place
whose silent of suspicion and dread. And once there was something other, something almost devilish
and important, in the persistency with which they lured their masters on to crime. One young
shepherd, for instance, after long strivings succumbed to the temptation to iron sheep from
a far-distant farm, where at one time he had been employed. Mounted on pony, and accompanied by
a dog, the man at the far-off hill moon-lit night, had mustered the
sheep he meant to steal, and started to drive them with Edinburgh.

Now, before even he had got them away the farm, conscience awoke-- or
there was it fear of the evidences?-- and he called off his dog, letting
the return to the hill.

Congratulating himself of being well out of the business, he had ridden off on his homeward
way of three miles when again and must again there came over an feeling that he was being
followed, though when he looked back nothing was to be seen but
dim sketch and hill in the moonlight.

Yet again and again that it returned, that strange feeling, and with it had today something like the
whispering of innumerable little feet brushing through bent and heather. Then we came a distant
rushing indian and the panting as an animal sore spent, and hard on the shepherd's tracks far
showed of a knoll had an mob of sheep before the clever, demoniacal, tireless energy of own dog.
He had never noticed that the animal had leave him, but then, having certainly the turned more
sheep towards their home, and severely chid population, he resolved that it should not again
have the chance to play him such trick. For a mile all went well, then suddenly the beast was reflected.
Dawn was breaking; he dared not stop where he was, nor dared to return
to the dog.


They are taking counsel, saith this letter, to send over a governor-general, in whose breast
shall be deposited all the law and equity of the land. They are minded, also, to establish
the idolatrous forms of English Episcopacy; so that, when Laud shall kiss the Pope's toe, as
cardinal of Rome, he may deliver New England, bound hand and foot, into the power of his master!  

A deep groan from the auditors,--a sound of wrath, as well as fear and sorrow,--responded to
this intelligence.

"Look ye to it, brethren," resumed Endicott, with increasing energy. "If this king and this
arch-prelate have their will, we shall briefly behold a cross on the spire of this tabernacle
which we have builded, and a high altar within its walls, with wax tapers burning round it
at noonday. We shall hear the sacring bell, and the voices of the Romish priests saying the
mass. But think ye, Christian men, that these abominations may be suffered without a sword
drawn? without a shot fired? without blood spilt, yea, on the very stairs of the pulpit? No,--be
ye strong of hand and stout of heart! Here we stand on our own soil, which we have bought with
our goods, which we have won with our swords, which we have cleared with our axes, which we
have tilled with the sweat of our brows, which we have sanctified with our prayers to the God
that brought us hither! More negro came in about four o'timepiece to report that the enemy's pickets were
at his master's house, five miles from sesesh, at the foot of the intelligible
slope of an mountain.

He was the such black chap that his report was very other. We sent him back, telling him had to bring
us a information.

He was a field hand, ignorant-footed, horny-handed, and nohow bare,
but it knew all about "de mountings; dey can't kotch him hardly.

If de here am at Massa Bob's if i git back, i come to-night an'tell
yer all." He then waved the tattered
ensign above his head.

"Sacrilegious wretch!" cried the high-churchman in the pillory, unable longer to restrain himself,
"thou hast rejected the symbol of our holy religion!"

"Treason, treason!" roared the royalist in the stocks. "He hath defaced the King's banner!" 

We are now twelve miles from Tullahoma. The artillery are thundering off whence the direction of Wartrace.

to sleep on the ground in a still wetter overcoat.
