I DEDICATE THIS BOOK TO YOU AND TO THE SWEET CHILD-FRIENDSHIP THAT YOU GAVE ME IN THE DAYS

PREFACE.

This collection of Japanese fairy tales is the outcome of a suggestion made to me indirectly
through a friend by Mr. Andrew Lang. They have been translated from the modern version written
by Sadanami Sanjin. These stories are not literal translations, and though the Japanese story
and all quaint Japanese expressions have been faithfully preserved, they have been told more
with the view to interest young readers of the West than the technical student of folk-lore.

Grateful acknowledgment is due to Mr. Y. Yasuoka, Miss Fusa Okamoto, my brother Nobumori Ozaki,
Dr. Yoshihiro Takaki, and Miss Kameko Yamao, who have helped me with translations.

The story which I have named "The Story of the Man who did not Wish to Die" is taken from a
little book written a hundred years ago by one Shinsui Tamenaga. It is named Chosei Furo, or
"Longevity." "The Bamboo-cutter and the Moon-child" is taken from the classic "Taketari Monogatari,"
and is NOT classed by the Japanese among their fairy tales, though it really belongs to this
class of literature.

The pictures were drawn by Mr. Kakuzo Fujiyama, a Tokio artist.

In telling these stories in English I have followed my fancy in adding such touches of local
color or description as they seemed to need or as pleased me, and in one or two instances I
have gathered in an incident from another version. At all times, among my friends, both young
and old, English or American, I have always found eager listeners to the beautiful legends
and fairy tales of Japan, and in telling them I have also found that they were still unknown
to the vast majority, and this has encouraged me to write them for the children of the West.

MY LORD BAG OF RICE.

Long, long ago there lived, in Japan a brave warrior known to all as Tawara Toda, or "My Lord
Bag of Rice." His true name was Fujiwara Hidesato, and there is a very interesting story of
how he came to change his name.

One day he sallied forth in search of adventures, for he had the nature of a warrior and could
not bear to be idle. So he buckled on his two swords, took his huge bow, much taller than himself,
in his hand, and slinging his quiver on his back started out. He had not gone far when he came
to the bridge of Seta-no-Karashi spanning one end of the beautiful Lake Biwa. No sooner had
he set foot on the bridge than he saw lying right across his path a huge serpent-dragon. Its
body was so big that it looked like the trunk of a large pine tree and it took up the whole
width of the bridge. One of its huge claws rested on the parapet of one side of the bridge,
while its tail lay right against the other. The monster seemed to be asleep, and as it breathed,
fire and smoke came out of its nostrils.

At first Hidesato could not help feeling alarmed at the sight of this horrible reptile lying
in his path, for he must either turn back or walk right over its body. He was a brave man,
however, and putting aside all fear went forward dauntlessly. Crunch, crunch! he stepped now
on the dragon's body, now between its coils, and without even one glance backward he went on
his way.

He had only gone a few steps when he heard some one calling him from behind. On turning back
he was much surprised to see that the monster dragon had entirely disappeared and in its place
was a strange-looking man, who was bowing most ceremoniously to the ground. His red hair streamed
over his shoulders and was surmounted by a crown in the shape of a dragon's head, and his sea-green
dress was patterned with shells. Hidesato knew at once that this was no ordinary mortal and
he wondered much at the strange occurrence. Where had the dragon gone in such a short space
of time? Or had it transformed itself into this man, and what did the whole thing mean? While
these thoughts passed through his mind he had come up to the man on the bridge and now addressed
him:

"Was it you that called me just now?"

"Yes, it was I," answered the man: "I have an earnest request to make to you. Do you think
you can grant it to me?"

"If it is in my power to do so I will," answered Hidesato, "but first tell me who you are?"

"I am the Dragon King of the Lake, and my home is in these waters just under this bridge."

"And what is it you have to ask of me!" said Hidesato.

"I want you to kill my mortal enemy the centipede, who lives on the mountain beyond," and the
Dragon King pointed to a high peak on the opposite shore of the lake.

"I have lived now for many years in this lake and I have a large family of children and grand-children.
For some time past we have lived in terror, for a monster centipede has discovered our home,
and night after night it comes and carries off one of my family. I am powerless to save them.
If it goes on much longer like this, not only shall I lose all my children, but I myself must
fall a victim to the monster. I am, therefore, very unhappy, and in my extremity I determined
to ask the help of a human being. For many days with this intention I have waited on the bridge
in the shape of the horrible serpent-dragon that you saw, in the hope that some strong brave
man would come along. But all who came this way, as soon as they saw me were terrified and
ran away as fast as they could. You are the first man I have found able to look at me without
fear, so I knew at once that you were a man of great courage. I beg you to have pity upon me.
Will you not help me and kill my enemy the centipede?"

Hidesato felt very sorry for the Dragon King on hearing his story, and readily promised to
do what he could to help him. The warrior asked where the centipede lived, so that he might
attack the creature at once. The Dragon King replied that its home was on the mountain Mikami,
but that as it came every night at a certain hour to the palace of the lake, it would be better
to wait till then. So Hidesato was conducted to the palace of the Dragon King, under the bridge.
Strange to say, as he followed his host downwards the waters parted to let them pass, and his
clothes did not even feel damp as he passed through the flood. Never had Hidesato seen anything
so beautiful as this palace built of white marble beneath the lake. He had often heard of the
Sea King's palace at the bottom of the sea, where all the servants and retainers were salt-water
fishes, but here was a magnificent building in the heart of Lake Biwa. The dainty goldfishes,
red carp, and silvery trout, waited upon the Dragon King and his guest.

Hidesato was astonished at the feast that was spread for him. The dishes were crystallized
lotus leaves and flowers, and the chopsticks were of the rarest ebony. As soon as they sat
down, the sliding doors opened and ten lovely goldfish dancers came out, and behind them followed
ten red-carp musicians with the koto and the samisen. Thus the hours flew by till midnight,
and the beautiful music and dancing had banished all thoughts of the centipede. The Dragon
King was about to pledge the warrior in a fresh cup of wine when the palace was suddenly shaken
by a tramp, tramp! as if a mighty army had begun to march not far away.

Hidesato and his host both rose to their feet and rushed to the balcony, and the warrior saw
on the opposite mountain two great balls of glowing fire coming nearer and nearer. The Dragon
King stood by the warrior's side trembling with fear.

"The centipede! The centipede! Those two balls of fire are its eyes. It is coming for its prey!
Now is the time to kill it."

Hidesato looked where his host pointed, and, in the dim light of the starlit evening, behind
the two balls of fire he saw the long body of an enormous centipede winding round the mountains,
and the light in its hundred feet glowed like so many distant lanterns moving slowly towards
the shore.

Hidesato showed not the least sign of fear. He tried to calm the Dragon King.

"Don't be afraid. I shall surely kill the centipede. Just bring me my bow and arrows."

The Dragon King did as he was bid, and the warrior noticed that he had only three arrows left
in his quiver. He took the bow, and fitting an arrow to the notch, took careful aim and let fly.

The arrow hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of penetrating, it
glanced off harmless and fell to the ground.

Nothing daunted, Hidesato took another arrow, fitted it to the notch of the bow and let fly.
Again the arrow hit the mark, it struck the centipede right in the middle of its head, only
to glance off and fall to the ground. The centipede was invulnerable to weapons! When the Dragon
King saw that even this brave warrior's arrows were powerless to kill the centipede, he lost
heart and began to tremble with fear.

The warrior saw that he had now only one arrow left in his quiver, and if this one failed he
could not kill the centipede. He looked across the waters. The huge reptile had wound its horrid
body seven times round the mountain and would soon come down to the lake. Nearer and nearer
gleamed fireballs of eyes, and the light of its hundred feet began to throw reflections in
the still waters of the lake.

Then suddenly the warrior remembered that he had heard that human saliva was deadly to centipedes.
But this was no ordinary centipede. This was so monstrous that even to think of such a creature
made one creep with horror. Hidesato determined to try his last chance. So taking his last
arrow and first putting the end of it in his mouth, he fitted the notch to his bow, took careful
aim once more and let fly.

This time the arrow again hit the centipede right in the middle of its head, but instead of
glancing off harmlessly as before, it struck home to the creature's brain. Then with a convulsive
shudder the serpentine body stopped moving, and the fiery light of its great eyes and hundred
feet darkened to a dull glare like the sunset of a stormy day, and then went out in blackness.
A great darkness now overspread the heavens, the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed,
and the wind roared in fury, and it seemed as if the world were coming to an end. The Dragon
King and his children and retainers all crouched in different parts of the palace, frightened
to death, for the building was shaken to its foundation. At last the dreadful night was over.
Day dawned beautiful and clear. The centipede was gone from the mountain.

Then Hidesato called to the Dragon King to come out with him on the balcony, for the centipede
was dead and he had nothing more to fear.

Then all the inhabitants of the palace came out with joy, and Hidesato pointed to the lake.
There lay the body of the dead centipede floating on the water, which was dyed red with its blood.

The gratitude of the Dragon King knew no bounds. The whole family came and bowed down before
the warrior, calling him their preserver and the bravest warrior in all Japan.

Another feast was prepared, more sumptuous than the first. All kinds of fish, prepared in every
imaginable way, raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, served on coral trays and crystal dishes,
were put before him, and the wine was the best that Hidesato had ever tasted in his life. To
add to the beauty of everything the sun shone brightly, the lake glittered like a liquid diamond,
and the palace was a thousand times more beautiful by day than by night.

His host tried to persuade the warrior to stay a few days, but Hidesato insisted on going home,
saying that he had now finished what he had come to do, and must return. The Dragon King and
his family were all very sorry to have him leave so soon, but since he would go they begged
him to accept a few small presents (so they said) in token of their gratitude to him for delivering
them forever from their horrible enemy the centipede.

As the warrior stood in the porch taking leave, a train of fish was suddenly transformed into
a retinue of men, all wearing ceremonial robes and dragon's crowns on their heads to show that
they were servants of the great Dragon King. The presents that they carried were as follows:

   First, a large bronze bell.
   Second, a bag of rice.
   Third, a roll of silk.
   Fourth, a cooking pot.
   Fifth, a bell.

Hidesato did not want to accept all these presents, but as the Dragon King insisted, he could
not well refuse.

The Dragon King himself accompanied the warrior as far as the bridge, and then took leave of
him with many bows and good wishes, leaving the procession of servants to accompany Hidesato
to his house with the presents.

The warrior's household and servants had been very much concerned when they found that he did
not return the night before, but they finally concluded that he had been kept by the violent
storm and had taken shelter somewhere. When the servants on the watch for his return caught
sight of him they called to every one that he was approaching, and the whole household turned
out to meet him, wondering much what the retinue of men, bearing presents and banners, that
followed him, could mean.

As soon as the Dragon King's retainers had put down the presents they vanished, and Hidesato
told all that had happened to him.

The presents which he had received from the grateful Dragon King were found to be of magic
power. The bell only was ordinary, and as Hidesato had no use for it he presented it to the
temple near by, where it was hung up, to boom out the hour of day over the surrounding neighborhood.

The single bag of rice, however much was taken from it day after day for the meals of the knight
and his whole family, never grew less--the supply in the bag was inexhaustible.

The roll of silk, too, never grew shorter, though time after time long pieces were cut off
to make the warrior a new suit of clothes to go to Court in at the New Year.

The cooking pot was wonderful, too. No matter what was put into it, it cooked deliciously whatever
was wanted without any firing--truly a very economical saucepan.

The fame of Hidesato's fortune spread far and wide, and as there was no need for him to spend
money on rice or silk or firing, he became very rich and prosperous, and was henceforth known
as My Lord Bag of Rice.

THE TONGUE-CUT SPARROW.

Long, long ago in Japan there lived an old man and his wife. The old man was a good, kind-hearted,
hard-working old fellow, but his wife was a regular cross-patch, who spoiled the happiness
of her home by her scolding tongue. She was always grumbling about something from morning to
night. The old man had for a long time ceased to take any notice of her crossness. He was out
most of the day at work in the fields, and as he had no child, for his amusement when he came
home, he kept a tame sparrow. He loved the little bird just as much as if she had been his child.

When he came back at night after his hard day's work in the open air it was his only pleasure
to pet the sparrow, to talk to her and to teach her little tricks, which she learned very quickly.
The old man would open her cage and let her fly about the room, and they would play together.
Then when supper-time came, he always saved some tit-bits from his meal with which to feed
his little bird.

Now one day the old man went out to chop wood in the forest, and the old woman stopped at home
to wash clothes. The day before, she had made some starch, and now when she came to look for
it, it was all gone; the bowl which she had filled full yesterday was quite empty.

While she was wondering who could have used or stolen the starch, down flew the pet sparrow,
and bowing her little feathered head--a trick which she had been taught by her master--the
pretty bird chirped and said:

"It is I who have taken the starch. I thought it was some food put out for me in that basin,
and I ate it all. If I have made a mistake I beg you to forgive me! tweet, tweet, tweet!"

You see from this that the sparrow was a truthful bird, and the old woman ought to have been
willing to forgive her at once when she asked her pardon so nicely. But not so.

The old woman had never loved the sparrow, and had often quarreled with her husband for keeping
what she called a dirty bird about the house, saying that it only made extra work for her.
Now she was only too delighted to have some cause of complaint against the pet. She scolded
and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior, and not content with using these
harsh, unfeeling words, in a fit of rage she seized the sparrow--who all this time had spread
out her wings and bowed her head before the old woman, to show how sorry she was--and fetched
the scissors and cut off the poor little bird's tongue.

"I suppose you took my starch with that tongue! Now you may see what it is like to go without
it!" And with these dreadful words she drove the bird away, not caring in the least what might
happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering, so unkind was she!

The old woman, after she had driven the sparrow away, made some more rice-paste, grumbling
all the time at the trouble, and after starching all her clothes, spread the things on boards
to dry in the sun, instead of ironing them as they do in England.

In the evening the old man came home. As usual, on the way back he looked forward to the time
when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him, ruffling
out her feathers to show her joy, and at last coming to rest on his shoulder. But to-night
the old man was very disappointed, for not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen.

He quickened his steps, hastily drew off his straw sandals, and stepped on to the veranda.
Still no sparrow was to be seen. He now felt sure that his wife, in one of her cross tempers,
had shut the sparrow up in its cage. So he called her and said anxiously:

"Where is Suzume San (Miss Sparrow) today?"

The old woman pretended not to know at first, and answered:

"Your sparrow? I am sure I don't know. Now I come to think of it, I haven't seen her all the
afternoon. I shouldn't wonder if the ungrateful bird had flown away and left you after all
your petting!"

But at last, when the old man gave her no peace, but asked her again and again, insisting that
she must know what had happened to his pet, she confessed all. She told him crossly how the
sparrow had eaten the rice-paste she had specially made for starching her clothes, and how
when the sparrow had confessed to what she had done, in great anger she had taken her scissors
and cut out her tongue, and how finally she had driven the bird away and forbidden her to return
to the house again.

Then the old woman showed her husband the sparrow's tongue, saying:

"Here is the tongue I cut off! Horrid little bird, why did it eat all my starch?"

"How could you be so cruel? Oh! how could you so cruel?" was all that the old man could answer.
He was too kind-hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife, but he was terribly distressed at
what had happened to his poor little sparrow.

"What a dreadful misfortune for my poor Suzume San to lose her tongue!" he said to himself.
"She won't be able to chirp any more, and surely the pain of the cutting of it out in that
rough way must have made her ill! Is there nothing to be done?"

The old man shed many tears after his cross wife had gone to sleep. While he wiped away the
tears with the sleeve of his cotton robe, a bright thought comforted him: he would go and look
for the sparrow on the morrow. Having decided this he was able to go to sleep at last.

The next morning he rose early, as soon as ever the day broke, and snatching a hasty breakfast,
started out over the hills and through the woods, stopping at every clump of bamboos to cry:

"Where, oh where does my tongue-cut sparrow stay? Where, oh where, does my tongue-cut sparrow
stay!"

He never stopped to rest for his noonday meal, and it was far on in the afternoon when he found
himself near a large bamboo wood. Bamboo groves are the favorite haunts of sparrows, and there
sure enough at the edge of the wood he saw his own dear sparrow waiting to welcome him. He
could hardly believe his eyes for joy, and ran forward quickly to greet her. She bowed her
little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her, to show her
pleasure at seeing her old friend again, and, wonderful to relate, she could talk as of old.
The old man told her how sorry he was for all that had happened, and inquired after her tongue,
wondering how she could speak so well without it. Then the sparrow opened her beak and showed
him that a new tongue had grown in place of the old one, and begged him not to think any more
about the past, for she was quite well now. Then the old man knew that his sparrow was a fairy,
and no common bird. It would be difficult to exaggerate the old man's rejoicing now. He forgot
all his troubles, he forgot even how tired he was, for he had found his lost sparrow, and instead
of being ill and without a tongue as he had feared and expected to find her, she was well and
happy and with a new tongue, and without a sign of the ill-treatment she had received from
his wife. And above all she was a fairy.

The sparrow asked him to follow her, and flying before him she led him to a beautiful house
in the heart of the bamboo grove. The old man was utterly astonished when he entered the house
to find what a beautiful place it was. It was built of the whitest wood, the soft cream-colored
mats which took the place of carpets were the finest he had ever seen, and the cushions that
the sparrow brought out for him to sit on were made of the finest silk and crape. Beautiful
vases and lacquer boxes adorned the tokonoma[1] of every room.

[1] An alcove where precious objects are displayed.

The sparrow led the old man to the place of honor, and then, taking her place at a humble distance,
she thanked him with many polite bows for all the kindness he had shown her for many long years.

Then the Lady Sparrow, as we will now call her, introduced all her family to the old man. This
done, her daughters, robed in dainty crape gowns, brought in on beautiful old-fashioned trays
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods, till the old man began to think he must be dreaming.
In the middle of the dinner some of the sparrow's daughters performed a wonderful dance, called
the "suzume-odori" or the "Sparrow's dance," to amuse the guest.

Never had the old man enjoyed himself so much. The hours flew by too quickly in this lovely
spot, with all these fairy sparrows to wait upon him and to feast him and to dance before him.

But the night came on and the darkness reminded him that he had a long way to go and must think
about taking his leave and return home. He thanked his kind hostess for her splendid entertainment,
and begged her for his sake to forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife.
He told the Lady Sparrow that it was a great comfort and happiness to him to find her in such
a beautiful home and to know that she wanted for nothing. It was his anxiety to know how she
fared and what had really happened to her that had led him to seek her. Now he knew that all
was well he could return home with a light heart. If ever she wanted him for anything she had
only to send for him and he would come at once.

The Lady Sparrow begged him to stay and rest several days and enjoy the change, but the old
man said he must return to his old wife--who would probably be cross at his not coming home
at the usual time--and to his work, and there-fore, much as he wished to do so, he could not
accept her kind invitation. But now that he knew where the Lady Sparrow lived he would come
to see her whenever he had the time.

When the Lady Sparrow saw that she could not persuade the old man to stay longer, she gave
an order to some of her servants, and they at once brought in two boxes, one large and the
other small. These were placed before the old man, and the Lady Sparrow asked him to choose
whichever he liked for a present, which she wished to give him.

The old man could not refuse this kind proposal, and he chose the smaller box, saying:

"I am now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box. As you are so kind as to say that
I may take whichever I like, I will choose the small one, which will be easier for me to carry."

Then the sparrows all helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off, bidding
him good-by with many bows and entreating him to come again whenever he had the time. Thus
the old man and his pet sparrow separated quite happily, the sparrow showing not the least
ill-will for all the unkindness she had suffered at the hands of the old wife. Indeed, she
only felt sorrow for the old man who had to put up with it all his life.

When the old man reached home he found his wife even crosser than usual, for it was late on
in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long time.

"Where have you been all this time?" she asked in a big voice. "Why do you come back so late?"

The old man tried to pacify her by showing her the box of presents he had brought back with
him, and then he told her of all that had happened to him, and how wonderfully he had been
entertained at the sparrow's house.

"Now let us see what is in the box," said the old man, not giving her time to grumble again.
"You must help me open it." And they both sat down before the box and opened it.

To their utter astonishment they found the box filled to the brim with gold and silver coins
and many other precious things. The mats of their little cottage fairly glittered as they took
out the things one by one and put them down and handled them over and over again. The old man
was overjoyed at the sight of the riches that were now his. Beyond his brightest expectations
was the sparrow's gift, which would enable him to give up work and live in ease and comfort
the rest of his days.

He said: "Thanks to my good little sparrow! Thanks to my good little sparrow!" many times.

But the old woman, after the first moments of surprise and satisfaction at the sight of the
gold and silver were over, could not suppress the greed of her wicked nature. She now began
to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents, for in the innocence
of his heart he had told her how he had refused the large box of presents which the sparrows
had offered him, preferring the smaller one because it was light and easy to carry home.

"You silly old man," said she, "Why did you not bring the large box? Just think what we have
lost. We might have had twice as much silver and gold as this. You are certainly an old fool!"
she screamed, and then went to bed as angry as she could be.

The old man now wished that he had said nothing about the big box, but it was too late; the
greedy old woman, not contented with the good luck which had so unexpectedly befallen them
and which she so little deserved, made up her mind, if possible, to get more.

Early the next morning she got up and made the old man describe the way to the sparrow's house.
When he saw what was in her mind he tried to keep her from going, but it was useless. She would
not listen to one word he said. It is strange that the old woman did not feel ashamed of going
to see the sparrow after the cruel way she had treated her in cutting off her tongue in a fit
of rage. But her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else. It did not even
enter her thoughts that the sparrows might be angry with her--as, indeed, they were--and might
punish her for what she had done.

Ever since the Lady Sparrow had returned home in the sad plight in which they had first found
her, weeping and bleeding from the mouth, her whole family and relations had done little else
but speak of the cruelty of the old woman. "How could she," they asked each other, "inflict
such a heavy punishment for such a trifling offense as that of eating some rice-paste by mistake?"
They all loved the old man who was so kind and good and patient under all his troubles, but
the old woman they hated, and they determined, if ever they had the chance, to punish her as
she deserved. They had not long to wait.

After walking for some hours the old woman had at last found the bamboo grove which she had
made her husband carefully describe, and now she stood before it crying out:

"Where is the tongue-cut sparrow's house? Where is the tongue-cut sparrow's house?"

At last she saw the eaves of the house peeping out from amongst the bamboo foliage. She hastened
to the door and knocked loudly.

When the servants told the Lady Sparrow that her old mistress was at the door asking to see
her, she was somewhat surprised at the unexpected visit, after all that had taken place, and
she wondered not a little at the boldness of the old woman in venturing to come to the house.
The Lady Sparrow, however, was a polite bird, and so she went out to greet the old woman, remembering
that she had once been her mistress.

The old woman intended, however, to waste no time in words, she went right to the point, without
the least shame, and said:

"You need not trouble to entertain me as you did my old man. I have come myself to get the
box which he so stupidly left behind. I shall soon take my leave if you will give me the big
box--that is all I want!"

The Lady Sparrow at once consented, and told her servants to bring out the big box. The old
woman eagerly seized it and hoisted it on her back, and without even stopping to thank the
Lady Sparrow began to hurry homewards.

The box was so heavy that she could not walk fast, much less run, as she would have liked to
do, so anxious was she to get home and see what was inside the box, but she had often to sit
down and rest herself by the way.

While she was staggering along under the heavy load, her desire to open the box became too
great to be resisted. She could wait no longer, for she supposed this big box to be full of
gold and silver and precious jewels like the small one her husband had received.

At last this greedy and selfish old woman put down the box by the wayside and opened it carefully,
expecting to gloat her eyes on a mine of wealth. What she saw, however, so terrified her that
she nearly lost her senses. As soon as she lifted the lid, a number of horrible and frightful
looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her. Not
even in nightmares had she ever seen such horrible creatures as her much-coveted box contained.
A demon with one huge eye right in the middle of its forehead came and glared at her, monsters
with gaping mouths looked as if they would devour her, a huge snake coiled and hissed about
her, and a big frog hopped and croaked towards her.

The old woman had never been so frightened in her life, and ran from the spot as fast as her
quaking legs would carry her, glad to escape alive. When she reached home she fell to the floor
and told her husband with tears all that had happened to her, and how she had been nearly killed
by the demons in the box.

Then she began to blame the sparrow, but the old man stopped her at once, saying:

"Don't blame the sparrow, it is your wickedness which has at last met with its reward. I only
hope this may be a lesson to you in the future!"

Long, long ago in the province of Tango there lived on the shore of Japan in the little fishing
village of Mizu-no-ye a young fisherman named Urashima Taro. His father had been a fisherman
before him, and his skill had more than doubly descended to his son, for Urashima was the most
skillful fisher in all that country side, and could catch more Bonito and Tai in a day than
his comrades could in a week.

But in the little fishing village, more than for being a clever fisher of the sea was he known
for his kind heart. In his whole life he had never hurt anything, either great or small, and
when a boy, his companions had always laughed at him, for he would never join with them in
teasing animals, but always tried to keep them from this cruel sport.

One soft summer twilight he was going home at the end of a day's fishing when he came upon
a group of children. They were all screaming and talking at the tops of their voices, and seemed
to be in a state of great excitement about something, and on his going up to them to see what
was the matter he saw that they were tormenting a tortoise. First one boy pulled it this way,
then another boy pulled it that way, while a third child beat it with a stick, and the fourth
hammered its shell with a stone.

Now Urashima felt very sorry for the poor tortoise and made up his mind to rescue it. He spoke
to the boys:

"Look here, boys, you are treating that poor tortoise so badly that it will soon die!"

The boys, who were all of an age when children seem to delight in being cruel to animals, took
no notice of Urashima's gentle reproof, but went on teasing it as before. One of the older
boys answered:

"Who cares whether it lives or dies? We do not. Here, boys, go on, go on!"

And they began to treat the poor tortoise more cruelly than ever. Urashima waited a moment,
turning over in his mind what would be the best way to deal with the boys. He would try to
persuade them to give the tortoise up to him, so he smiled at them and said:

"I am sure you are all good, kind boys! Now won't you give me the tortoise? I should like to
have it so much!"

"No, we won't give you the tortoise," said one of the boys. "Why should we? We caught it ourselves."

"What you say is true," said Urashima, "but I do not ask you to give it to me for nothing.
I will give you some money for it--in other words, the Ojisan (Uncle) will buy it of you. Won't
that do for you, my boys?" He held up the money to them, strung on a piece of string through
a hole in the center of each coin. "Look, boys, you can buy anything you like with this money.
You can do much more with this money than you can with that poor tortoise. See what good boys
you are to listen to me."

The boys were not bad boys at all, they were only mischievous, and as Urashima spoke they were
won by his kind smile and gentle words and began "to be of his spirit," as they say in Japan.
Gradually they all came up to him, the ringleader of the little band holding out the tortoise
to him.

"Very well, Ojisan, we will give you the tortoise if you will give us the money!" And Urashima
took the tortoise and gave the money to the boys, who, calling to each other, scampered away
and were soon out of sight.

Then Urashima stroked the tortoise's back, saying as he did so:

"Oh, you poor thing! Poor thing!--there, there! you are safe now! They say that a stork lives
for a thousand years, but the tortoise for ten thousand years. You have the longest life of
any creature in this world, and you were in great danger of having that precious life cut short
by those cruel boys. Luckily I was passing by and saved you, and so life is still yours. Now
I am going to take you back to your home, the sea, at once. Do not let yourself be caught again,
for there might be no one to save you next time!"

All the time that the kind fisherman was speaking he was walking quickly to the shore and out
upon the rocks; then putting the tortoise into the water he watched the animal disappear, and
turned homewards himself, for he was tired and the sun had set.

The next morning Urashima went out as usual in his boat. The weather was fine and the sea and
sky were both blue and soft in the tender haze of the summer morning. Urashima got into his
boat and dreamily pushed out to sea, throwing his line as he did so. He soon passed the other
fishing boats and left them behind him till they were lost to sight in the distance, and his
boat drifted further and further out upon the blue waters. Somehow, he knew not why, he felt
unusually happy that morning; and he could not help wishing that, like the tortoise he set
free the day before, he had thousands of years to live instead of his own short span of human life.

He was suddenly startled from his reverie by hearing his own name called:

"Urashima, Urashima!"

Clear as a bell and soft as the summer wind the name floated over the sea.

He stood up and looked in every direction, thinking that one of the other boats had overtaken
him, but gaze as he might over the wide expanse of water, near or far there was no sign of
a boat, so the voice could not have come from any human being.

Startled, and wondering who or what it was that had called him so clearly, he looked in all
directions round about him and saw that without his knowing it a tortoise had come to the side
of the boat. Urashima saw with surprise that it was the very tortoise he had rescued the day
before.

"Well, Mr. Tortoise," said Urashima, "was it you who called my name just now?"

The tortoise nodded its head several times and said:

"Yes, it was I. Yesterday in your honorable shadow (o kage sama de) my life was saved, and
I have come to offer you my thanks and to tell you how grateful I am for your kindness to me."

"Indeed," said Urashima, "that is very polite of you. Come up into the boat. I would offer
you a smoke, but as you are a tortoise doubtless you do not smoke," and the fisherman laughed
at the joke.

"He-he-he-he!" laughed the tortoise; "sake (rice wine) is my favorite refreshment, but I do
not care for tobacco."

"Indeed," said Urashima, "I regret very much that I have no "sake" in my boat to offer you,
but come up and dry your back in the sun--tortoises always love to do that."

So the tortoise climbed into the boat, the fisherman helping him, and after an exchange of
complimentary speeches the tortoise said:

"Have you ever seen Rin Gin, the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea, Urashima?"

The fisherman shook his head and replied; "No; year after year the sea has been my home, but
though I have often heard of the Dragon King's realm under the sea I have never yet set eyes
on that wonderful place. It must be very far away, if it exists at all!"

"Is that really so? You have never seen the Sea King's Palace? Then you have missed seeing
one of the most wonderful sights in the whole universe. It is far away at the bottom of the
sea, but if I take you there we shall soon reach the place. If you would like to see the Sea
King's land I will be your guide."

"I should like to go there, certainly, and you are very kind to think of taking me, but you
must remember that I am only a poor mortal and have not the power of swimming like a sea creature
such as you are--"

Before the fisherman could say more the tortoise stopped him, saying:

"What? You need not swim yourself. If you will ride on my back I will take you without any
trouble on your part."

"But," said Urashima, "how is it possible for me to ride on your small back?"

"It may seem absurd to you, but I assure you that you can do so. Try at once! Just come and
get on my back, and see if it is as impossible as you think!"

As the tortoise finished speaking, Urashima looked at its shell, and strange to say he saw
that the creature had suddenly grown so big that a man could easily sit on its back.

"This is strange indeed!" said Urashima; "then. Mr. Tortoise, with your kind permission I will
get on your back. Dokoisho!"[2] he exclaimed as he jumped on.

[2] "All right" (only used by lower classes).

The tortoise, with an unmoved face, as if this strange proceeding were quite an ordinary event,
said:

"Now we will set out at our leisure," and with these words he leapt into the sea with Urashima
on his back. Down through the water the tortoise dived. For a long time these two strange companions
rode through the sea. Urashima never grew tired, nor his clothes moist with the water. At last,
far away in the distance a magnificent gate appeared, and behind the gate, the long, sloping
roofs of a palace on the horizon.

"Ya," exclaimed Urashima. "That looks like the gate of some large palace just appearing! Mr.
Tortoise, can you tell what that place is we can now see?"

"That is the great gate of the Rin Gin Palace, the large roof that you see behind the gate
is the Sea King's Palace itself."

"Then we have at last come to the realm of the Sea King and to his Palace," said Urashima.

"Yes, indeed," answered the tortoise, "and don't you think we have come very quickly?" And
while he was speaking the tortoise reached the side of the gate. "And here we are, and you
must please walk from here."

The tortoise now went in front, and speaking to the gatekeeper, said:

"This is Urashima Taro, from the country of Japan. I have had the honor of bringing him as
a visitor to this kingdom. Please show him the way."

Then the gatekeeper, who was a fish, at once led the way through the gate before them.

The red bream, the flounder, the sole, the cuttlefish, and all the chief vassals of the Dragon
King of the Sea now came out with courtly bows to welcome the stranger.

"Urashima Sama, Urashima Sama! welcome to the Sea Palace, the home of the Dragon King of the
Sea. Thrice welcome are you, having come from such a distant country. And you, Mr. Tortoise,
we are greatly indebted to you for all your trouble in bringing Urashima here." Then, turning
again to Urashima, they said, "Please follow us this way," and from here the whole band of
fishes became his guides.

Urashima, being only a poor fisher lad, did not know how to behave in a palace; but, strange
though it was all to him, he did not feel ashamed or embarrassed, but followed his kind guides
quite calmly where they led to the inner palace. When he reached the portals a beautiful Princess
with her attendant maidens came out to welcome him. She was more beautiful than any human being,
and was robed in flowing garments of red and soft green like the under side of a wave, and
golden threads glimmered through the folds of her gown. Her lovely black hair streamed over
her shoulders in the fashion of a king's daughter many hundreds of years ago, and when she
spoke her voice sounded like music over the water. Urashima was lost in wonder while he looked
upon her, and he could not speak. Then he remembered that he ought to bow, but before he could
make a low obeisance the Princess took him by the hand and led him to a beautiful hall, and
to the seat of honor at the upper end, and bade him be seated.

"Urashima Taro, it gives me the highest pleasure to welcome you to my father's kingdom," said
the Princess. "Yesterday you set free a tortoise, and I have sent for you to thank you for
saving my life, for I was that tortoise. Now if you like you shall live here forever in the
land of eternal youth, where summer never dies and where sorrow never comes, and I will be
your bride if you will, and we will live together happily forever afterwards!"

And as Urashima listened to her sweet words and gazed upon her lovely face his heart was filled
with a great wonder and joy, and he answered her, wondering if it was not all a dream:

"Thank you a thousand times for your kind speech. There is nothing I could wish for more than
to be permitted to stay here with you in this beautiful land, of which I have often heard,
but have never seen to this day. Beyond all words, this is the most wonderful place I have
ever seen."

While he was speaking a train of fishes appeared, all dressed in ceremonial, trailing garments.
One by one, silently and with stately steps, they entered the hall, bearing on coral trays
delicacies of fish and seaweed, such as no one can dream of, and this wondrous feast was set
before the bride and bridegroom. The bridal was celebrated with dazzling splendor, and in the
Sea King's realm there was great rejoicing. As soon as the young pair had pledged themselves
in the wedding cup of wine, three times three, music was played, and songs were sung, and fishes
with silver scales and golden tails stepped in from the waves and danced. Urashima enjoyed
himself with all his heart. Never in his whole life had he sat down to such a marvelous feast.

When the feast was over the Princes asked the bridegroom if he would like to walk through the
palace and see all there was to be seen. Then the happy fisherman, following his bride, the
Sea King's daughter, was shown all the wonders of that enchanted land where youth and joy go
hand in hand and neither time nor age can touch them. The palace was built of coral and adorned
with pearls, and the beauties and wonders of the place were so great that the tongue fails
to describe them.

But, to Urashima, more wonderful than the palace was the garden that surrounded it. Here was
to be seen at one time the scenery of the four different seasons; the beauties of summer and
winter, spring and autumn, were displayed to the wondering visitor at once.

First, when he looked to the east, the plum and cherry trees were seen in full bloom, the nightingales
sang in the pink avenues, and butterflies flitted from flower to flower.

Looking to the south all the trees were green in the fullness of summer, and the day cicala
and the night cricket chirruped loudly.

Looking to the west the autumn maples were ablaze like a sunset sky, and the chrysanthemums
were in perfection.

Looking to the north the change made Urashima start, for the ground was silver white with snow,
and trees and bamboos were also covered with snow and the pond was thick with ice.

And each day there were new joys and new wonders for Urashima, and so great was his happiness
that he forgot everything, even the home he had left behind and his parents and his own country,
and three days passed without his even thinking of all he had left behind. Then his mind came
back to him and he remembered who he was, and that he did not belong to this wonderful land
or the Sea King's palace, and he said to himself:

"O dear! I must not stay on here, for I have an old father and mother at home. What can have
happened to them all this time? How anxious they must have been these days when I did not return
as usual. I must go back at once without letting one more day pass." And he began to prepare
for the journey in great haste.

Then he went to his beautiful wife, the Princess, and bowing low before her he said:

"Indeed, I have been very happy with you for a long time, Otohime Sama" (for that was her name),
"and you have been kinder to me than any words can tell. But now I must say good-by. I must
go back to my old parents."

Then Otohime Sama began to weep, and said softly and sadly:

"Is it not well with you here, Urashima, that you wish to leave me so soon? Where is the haste?
Stay with me yet another day only!"

But Urashima had remembered his old parents, and in Japan the duty to parents is stronger than
everything else, stronger even than pleasure or love, and he would not be persuaded, but answered:

"Indeed, I must go. Do not think that I wish to leave you. It is not that. I must go and see
my old parents. Let me go for one day and I will come back to you."

"Then," said the Princess sorrowfully, "there is nothing to be done. I will send you back to-day
to your father and mother, and instead of trying to keep you with me one more day, I shall
give you this as a token of our love--please take it back with you;" and she brought him a
beautiful lacquer box tied about with a silken cord and tassels of red silk.

Urashima had received so much from the Princess already that he felt some compunction in taking
the gift, and said:

"It does not seem right for me to take yet another gift from you after all the many favors
I have received at your hands, but because it is your wish I will do so," and then he added:

"Tell me what is this box?"

"That," answered the Princess "is the tamate-bako (Box of the Jewel Hand), and it contains
something very precious. You must not open this box, whatever happens! If you open it something
dreadful will happen to you! Now promise me that you will never open this box!"

And Urashima promised that he would never, never open the box whatever happened.

Then bidding good-by to Otohime Sama he went down to the seashore, the Princess and her attendants
following him, and there he found a large tortoise waiting for him.

He quickly mounted the creature's back and was carried away over the shining sea into the East.
He looked back to wave his hand to Otohime Sama till at last he could see her no more, and
the land of the Sea King and the roofs of the wonderful palace were lost in the far, far distance.
Then, with his face turned eagerly towards his own land, he looked for the rising of the blue
hills on the horizon before him.

At last the tortoise carried him into the bay he knew so well, and to the shore from whence
he had set out. He stepped on to the shore and looked about him while the tortoise rode away
back to the Sea King's realm.

But what is the strange fear that seizes Urashima as he stands and looks about him? Why does
he gaze so fixedly at the people that pass him by, and why do they in turn stand and look at
him? The shore is the same and the hills are the same, but the people that he sees walking
past him have very different faces to those he had known so well before.

Wondering what it can mean he walks quickly towards his old home. Even that looks different,
but a house stands on the spot, and he calls out:

"Father, I have just returned!" and he was about to enter, when he saw a strange man coming out.

"Perhaps my parents have moved while I have been away, and have gone somewhere else," was the
fisherman's thought. Somehow he began to feel strangely anxious, he could not tell why.

"Excuse me," said he to the man who was staring at him, "but till within the last few days
I have lived in this house. My name is Urashima Taro. Where have my parents gone whom I left here?"

A very bewildered expression came over the face of the man, and, still gazing intently on Urashima's
face, he said:

"What? Are you Urashima Taro?"

"Yes," said the fisherman, "I am Urashima Taro!"

"Ha, ha!" laughed the man, "you must not make such jokes. It is true that once upon a time
a man called Urashima Taro did live in this village, but that is a story three hundred years
old. He could not possibly be alive now!"

When Urashima heard these strange words he was frightened, and said:

"Please, please, you must not joke with me, I am greatly perplexed. I am really Urashima Taro,
and I certainly have not lived three hundred years. Till four or five days ago I lived on this
spot. Tell me what I want to know without more joking, please."

But the man's face grew more and more grave, and he answered:

"You may or may not be Urashima Taro, I don't know. But the Urashima Taro of whom I have heard
is a man who lived three hundred years ago. Perhaps you are his spirit come to revisit your
old home?"

"Why do you mock me?" said Urashima. "I am no spirit! I am a living man--do you not see my
feet;" and "don-don," he stamped on the ground, first with one foot and then with the other
to show the man. (Japanese ghosts have no feet.)

"But Urashima Taro lived three hundred years ago, that is all I know; it is written in the
village chronicles," persisted the man, who could not believe what the fisherman said.

Urashima was lost in bewilderment and trouble. He stood looking all around him, terribly puzzled,
and, indeed, something in the appearance of everything was different to what he remembered
before he went away, and the awful feeling came over him that what the man said was perhaps
true. He seemed to be in a strange dream. The few days he had spent in the Sea King's palace
beyond the sea had not been days at all: they had been hundreds of years, and in that time
his parents had died and all the people he had ever known, and the village had written down
his story. There was no use in staying here any longer. He must get back to his beautiful wife
beyond the sea.

He made his way back to the beach, carrying in his hand the box which the Princess had given
him. But which was the way? He could not find it alone! Suddenly he remembered the box, the
tamate-bako.

"The Princess told me when she gave me the box never to open it--that it contained a very precious
thing. But now that I have no home, now that I have lost everything that was dear to me here,
and my heart grows thin with sadness, at such a time, if I open the box, surely I shall find
something that will help me, something that will show me the way back to my beautiful Princess
over the sea. There is nothing else for me to do now. Yes, yes, I will open the box and look in!"

And so his heart consented to this act of disobedience, and he tried to persuade himself that
he was doing the right thing in breaking his promise.

Slowly, very slowly, he untied the red silk cord, slowly and wonderingly he lifted the lid
of the precious box. And what did he find? Strange to say only a beautiful little purple cloud
rose out of the box in three soft wisps. For an instant it covered his face and wavered over
him as if loath to go, and then it floated away like vapor over the sea.

Urashima, who had been till that moment like a strong and handsome youth of twenty-four, suddenly
became very, very old. His back doubled up with age, his hair turned snowy white, his face
wrinkled and he fell down dead on the beach.

Poor Urashima! because of his disobedience he could never return to the Sea King's realm or
the lovely Princess beyond the sea.

Little children, never be disobedient to those who are wiser than you for disobedience was
the beginning of all the miseries and sorrows of life.

THE FARMER AND THE BADGER

Long, long ago, there lived an old farmer and his wife who had made their home in the mountains,
far from any town. Their only neighbor was a bad and malicious badger. This badger used to
come out every night and run across to the farmer's field and spoil the vegetables and the
rice which the farmer spent his time in carefully cultivating. The badger at last grew so ruthless
in his mischievous work, and did so much harm everywhere on the farm, that the good-natured
farmer could not stand it any longer, and determined to put a stop to it. So he lay in wait
day after day and night after night, with a big club, hoping to catch the badger, but all in
vain. Then he laid traps for the wicked animal.

The farmer's trouble and patience was rewarded, for one fine day on going his rounds he found
the badger caught in a hole he had dug for that purpose. The farmer was delighted at having
caught his enemy, and carried him home securely bound with rope. When he reached the house
the farmer said to his wife:

"I have at last caught the bad badger. You must keep an eye on him while I am out at work and
not let him escape, because I want to make him into soup to-night."

Saying this, he hung the badger up to the rafters of his storehouse and went out to his work
in the fields. The badger was in great distress, for he did not at all like the idea of being
made into soup that night, and he thought and thought for a long time, trying to hit upon some
plan by which he might escape. It was hard to think clearly in his uncomfortable position,
for he had been hung upside down. Very near him, at the entrance to the storehouse, looking
out towards the green fields and the trees and the pleasant sunshine, stood the farmer's old
wife pounding barley. She looked tired and old. Her face was seamed with many wrinkles, and
was as brown as leather, and every now and then she stopped to wipe the perspiration which
rolled down her face.

"Dear lady," said the wily badger, "you must be very weary doing such heavy work in your old
age. Won't you let me do that for you? My arms are very strong, and I could relieve you for
a little while!"

"Thank you for your kindness," said the old woman, "but I cannot let you do this work for me
because I must not untie you, for you might escape if I did, and my husband would be very angry
if he came home and found you gone."

Now, the badger is one of the most cunning of animals, and he said again in a very sad, gentle,
voice:

"You are very unkind. You might untie me, for I promise not to try to escape. If you are afraid
of your husband, I will let you bind me again before his return when I have finished pounding
the barley. I am so tired and sore tied up like this. If you would only let me down for a few
minutes I would indeed be thankful!"

The old woman had a good and simple nature, and could not think badly of any one. Much less
did she think that the badger was only deceiving her in order to get away. She felt sorry,
too, for the animal as she turned to look at him. He looked in such a sad plight hanging downwards
from the ceiling by his legs, which were all tied together so tightly that the rope and the
knots were cutting into the skin. So in the kindness of her heart, and believing the creature's
promise that he would not run away, she untied the cord and let him down.

The old woman then gave him the wooden pestle and told him to do the work for a short time
while she rested. He took the pestle, but instead of doing the work as he was told, the badger
at once sprang upon the old woman and knocked her down with the heavy piece of wood. He then
killed her and cut her up and made soup of her, and waited for the return of the old farmer.
The old man worked hard in his fields all day, and as he worked he thought with pleasure that
no more now would his labor be spoiled by the destructive badger.

Towards sunset he left his work and turned to go home. He was very tired, but the thought of
the nice supper of hot badger soup awaiting his return cheered him. The thought that the badger
might get free and take revenge on the poor old woman never once came into his mind.

The badger meanwhile assumed the old woman's form, and as soon as he saw the old farmer approaching
came out to greet him on the veranda of the little house, saying:

"So you have come back at last. I have made the badger soup and have been waiting for you for
a long time."

The old farmer quickly took off his straw sandals and sat down before his tiny dinner-tray.
The innocent man never even dreamed that it was not his wife but the badger who was waiting
upon him, and asked at once for the soup. Then the badger suddenly transformed himself back
to his natural form and cried out:

"You wife-eating old man! Look out for the bones in the kitchen!"

Laughing loudly and derisively he escaped out of the house and ran away to his den in the hills.
The old man was left behind alone. He could hardly believe what he had seen and heard. Then
when he understood the whole truth he was so scared and horrified that he fainted right away.
After a while he came round and burst into tears. He cried loudly and bitterly. He rocked himself
to and fro in his hopeless grief. It seemed too terrible to be real that his faithful old wife
had been killed and cooked by the badger while he was working quietly in the fields, knowing
nothing of what was going on at home, and congratulating himself on having once for all got
rid of the wicked animal who had so often spoiled his fields. And oh! the horrible thought;
he had very nearly drunk the soup which the creature had made of his poor old woman. "Oh dear,
oh dear, oh dear!" he wailed aloud. Now, not far away there lived in the same mountain a kind,
good-natured old rabbit. He heard the old man crying and sobbing and at once set out to see
what was the matter, and if there was anything he could do to help his neighbor. The old man
told him all that had happened. When the rabbit heard the story he was very angry at the wicked
and deceitful badger, and told the old man to leave everything to him and he would avenge his
wife's death. The farmer was at last comforted, and, wiping away his tears, thanked the rabbit
for his goodness in coming to him in his distress.

The rabbit, seeing that the farmer was growing calmer, went back to his home to lay his plans
for the punishment of the badger.

The next day the weather was fine, and the rabbit went out to find the badger. He was not to
be seen in the woods or on the hillside or in the fields anywhere, so the rabbit went to his
den and found the badger hiding there, for the animal had been afraid to show himself ever
since he had escaped from the farmer's house, for fear of the old man's wrath.

The rabbit called out:

"Why are you not out on such a beautiful day? Come out with me, and we will go and cut grass
on the hills together."

The badger, never doubting but that the rabbit was his friend, willingly consented to go out
with him, only too glad to get away from the neighborhood of the farmer and the fear of meeting
him. The rabbit led the way miles away from their homes, out on the hills where the grass grew
tall and thick and sweet. They both set to work to cut down as much as they could carry home,
to store it up for their winter's food. When they had each cut down all they wanted they tied
it in bundles and then started homewards, each carrying his bundle of grass on his back. This
time the rabbit made the badger go first.

When they had gone a little way the rabbit took out a flint and steel, and, striking it over
the badger's back as he stepped along in front, set his bundle of grass on fire. The badger
heard the flint striking, and asked:

"What is that noise. 'Crack, crack'?"

"Oh, that is nothing." replied the rabbit; "I only said 'Crack, crack' because this mountain
is called Crackling Mountain."

The fire soon spread in the bundle of dry grass on the badger's back. The badger, hearing the
crackle of the burning grass, asked, "What is that?"

"Now we have come to the 'Burning Mountain,'" answered the rabbit.

By this time the bundle was nearly burned out and all the hair had been burned off the badger's
back. He now knew what had happened by the smell of the smoke of the burning grass. Screaming
with pain the badger ran as fast as he could to his hole. The rabbit followed and found him
lying on his bed groaning with pain.

"What an unlucky fellow you are!" said the rabbit. "I can't imagine how this happened! I will
bring you some medicine which will heal your back quickly!"

The rabbit went away glad and smiling to think that the punishment upon the badger had already
begun. He hoped that the badger would die of his burns, for he felt that nothing could be too
bad for the animal, who was guilty of murdering a poor helpless old woman who had trusted him.
He went home and made an ointment by mixing some sauce and red pepper together.

He carried this to the badger, but before putting it on he told him that it would cause him
great pain, but that he must bear it patiently, because it was a very wonderful medicine for
burns and scalds and such wounds. The badger thanked him and begged him to apply it at once.
But no language can describe the agony of the badger as soon as the red pepper had been pasted
all over his sore back. He rolled over and over and howled loudly. The rabbit, looking on,
felt that the farmer's wife was beginning to be avenged.

The badger was in bed for about a month; but at last, in spite of the red pepper application,
his burns healed and he got well. When the rabbit saw that the badger was getting well, he
thought of another plan by which he could compass the creature's death. So he went one day
to pay the badger a visit and to congratulate him on his recovery.

During the conversation the rabbit mentioned that he was going fishing, and described how pleasant
fishing was when the weather was fine and the sea smooth.

The badger listened with pleasure to the rabbit's account of the way he passed his time now,
and forgot all his pains and his month's illness, and thought what fun it would be if he could
go fishing too; so he asked the rabbit if he would take him the next time he went out to fish.
This was just what the rabbit wanted, so he agreed.

Then he went home and built two boats, one of wood and the other of clay. At last they were
both finished, and as the rabbit stood and looked at his work he felt that all his trouble
would be well rewarded if his plan succeeded, and he could manage to kill the wicked badger now.

The day came when the rabbit had arranged to take the badger fishing. He kept the wooden boat
himself and gave the badger the clay boat. The badger, who knew nothing about boats, was delighted
with his new boat and thought how kind it was of the rabbit to give it to him. They both got
into their boats and set out. After going some distance from the shore the rabbit proposed
that they should try their boats and see which one could go the quickest. The badger fell in
with the proposal, and they both set to work to row as fast as they could for some time. In
the middle of the race the badger found his boat going to pieces, for the water now began to
soften the clay. He cried out in great fear to the rabbit to help him. But the rabbit answered
that he was avenging the old woman's murder, and that this had been his intention all along,
and that he was happy to think that the badger had at last met his deserts for all his evil
crimes, and was to drown with no one to help him. Then he raised his oar and struck at the
badger with all his strength till he fell with the sinking clay boat and was seen no more.

Thus at last he kept his promise to the old farmer. The rabbit now turned and rowed shorewards,
and having landed and pulled his boat upon the beach, hurried back to tell the old farmer everything,
and how the badger, his enemy, had been killed.

The old farmer thanked him with tears in his eyes. He said that till now he could never sleep
at night or be at peace in the daytime, thinking of how his wife's death was unavenged, but
from this time he would be able to sleep and eat as of old. He begged the rabbit to stay with
him and share his home, so from this day the rabbit went to stay with the old farmer and they
both lived together as good friends to the end of their days.

THE shinansha, OR THE SOUTH POINTING CARRIAGE.

The compass, with its needle always pointing to the North, is quite a common thing, and no
one thinks that it is remarkable now, though when it was first invented it must have been a wonder.

Now long ago in China, there was a still more wonderful invention called the shinansha. This
was a kind of chariot with the figure of a man on it always pointing to the South. No matter
how the chariot was placed the figure always wheeled about and pointed to the South.

This curious instrument was invented by Kotei, one of the three Chinese Emperors of the Mythological
age. Kotei was the son of the Emperor Yuhi. Before he was born his mother had a vision which
foretold that her son would be a great man.

One summer evening she went out to walk in the meadows to seek the cool breezes which blow
at the end of the day and to gaze with pleasure at the star-lit heavens above her. As she looked
at the North Star, strange to relate, it shot forth vivid flashes of lightning in every direction.
Soon after this her son Kotei came into the world.

Kotei in time grew to manhood and succeeded his father the Emperor Yuhi. His early reign was
greatly troubled by the rebel Shiyu. This rebel wanted to make himself King, and many were
the battles which he fought to this end. Shiyu was a wicked magician, his head was made of
iron, and there was no man that could conquer him.

At last Kotei declared war against the rebel and led his army to battle, and the two armies
met on a plain called Takuroku. The Emperor boldly attacked the enemy, but the magician brought
down a dense fog upon the battlefield, and while the royal army were wandering about in confusion,
trying to find their way, Shiyu retreated with his troops, laughing at having fooled the royal
army.

No matter however strong and brave the Emperor's soldiers were, the rebel with his magic could
always escape in the end.

Kotei returned to his Palace, and thought and pondered deeply as to how he should conquer the
magician, for he was determined not to give up yet. After a long time he invented the shinansha
with the figure of a man always pointing South, for there were no compasses in those days.
With this instrument to show him the way he need not fear the dense fogs raised up by the magician
to confound his men.

Kotei again declared war against Shiyu. He placed the shinansha in front of his army and led
the way to the battlefield.

The battle began in earnest. The rebel was being driven backward by the royal troops when he
again resorted to magic, and upon his saying some strange words in a loud voice, immediately
a dense fog came down upon the battlefield.

But this time no soldier minded the fog, not one was confused. Kotei by pointing to the shinansha
could find his way and directed the army without a single mistake. He closely pursued the rebel
army and drove them backward till they came to a big river. This river Kotei and his men found
was swollen by the floods and impossible to cross.

Shiyu by using his magic art quickly passed over with his army and shut himself up in a fortress
on the opposite bank.

When Kotei found his march checked he was wild with disappointment, for he had very nearly
overtaken the rebel when the river stopped him.

He could do nothing, for there were no boats in those days, so the Emperor ordered his tent
to be pitched in the pleasantest spot that the place afforded.

One day he stepped forth from his tent and after walking about for a short time he came to
a pond. Here he sat down on the bank and was lost in thought.

It was autumn. The trees growing along the edge of the water were shedding their leaves, which
floated hither and thither on the surface of the pond. By and by, Kotei's attention was attracted
to a spider on the brink of the water. The little insect was trying to get on to one of the
floating leaves near by. It did so at last, and was soon floating over the water to the other
side of the pond.

This little incident made the clever Emperor think that he might try to make something that
could carry himself and his men over the river in the same way that the leaf had carried over
the spider. He set to work and persevered till he invented the first boat. When he found that
it was a success he set all his men to make more, and in time there were enough boats for the
whole army.

Kotei now took his army across the river, and attacked Shiyu's headquarters. He gained a complete
victory, and so put an end to the war which had troubled his country for so long.

This wise and good Emperor did not rest till he had secured peace and prosperity throughout
his whole land. He was beloved by his subjects, who now enjoyed their happiness of peace for
many long years under him. He spent a great deal of time in making inventions which would benefit
his people, and he succeeded in many besides the boat and the South Pointing shinansha.

He had reigned about a hundred years when one day, as Kotei was looking upwards, the sky became
suddenly red, and something came glittering like gold towards the earth. As it came nearer
Kotei saw that it was a great Dragon. The Dragon approached and bowed down its head before
the Emperor. The Empress and the courtiers were so frightened that they ran away screaming.

But the Emperor only smiled and called to them to stop, and said:

"Do not be afraid. This is a messenger from Heaven. My time here is finished!" He then mounted
the Dragon, which began to ascend towards the sky.

When the Empress and the courtiers saw this they all cried out together:

"Wait a moment! We wish to come too." And they all ran and caught hold of the Dragon's beard
and tried to mount him.

But it was impossible for so many people to ride on the Dragon. Several of them hung on to
the creature's beard so that when it tried to mount the hair was pulled out and they fell to
the ground.

Meanwhile the Empress and a few of the courtiers were safely seated on the Dragon's back. The
Dragon flew up so high in the heavens that in a short time the inmates of the Palace, who had
been left behind disappointed, could see them no more.

After some time a bow and an arrow dropped to the earth in the courtyard of the Palace. They
were recognized as having belonged to the Emperor Kotei. The courtiers took them up carefully
and preserved them as sacred relics in the Palace.

THE ADVENTURES OF KINTARO, THE GOLDEN BOY.

Long, long ago there lived in Kyoto a brave soldier named Kintoki. Now he fell in love with
a beautiful lady and married her. Not long after this, through the malice of some of his friends,
he fell into disgrace at Court and was dismissed. This misfortune so preyed upon his mind that
he did not long survive his dismissal--he died, leaving behind him his beautiful young wife
to face the world alone. Fearing her husband's enemies, she fled to the Ashigara Mountains
as soon as her husband was dead, and there in the lonely forests where no one ever came except
woodcutters, a little boy was born to her. She called him Kintaro or the Golden Boy. Now the
remarkable thing about this child was his great strength, and as he grew older he grew stronger
and stronger, so that by the time he was eight years of age he was able to cut down trees as
quickly as the woodcutters. Then his mother gave him a large ax, and he used to go out in the
forest and help the woodcutters, who called him "Wonder-child," and his mother the "Old Nurse
of the Mountains," for they did not know her high rank. Another favorite pastime of Kintaro's
was to smash up rocks and stones. You can imagine how strong he was!

Quite unlike other boys, Kintaro, grew up all alone in the mountain wilds, and as he had no
companions he made friends with all the animals and learned to understand them and to speak
their strange talk. By degrees they all grew quite tame and looked upon Kintaro as their master,
and he used them as his servants and messengers. But his special retainers were the bear, the
deer, the monkey and the hare.

The bear often brought her cubs for Kintaro to romp with, and when she came to take them home
Kintaro would get on her back and have a ride to her cave. He was very fond of the deer too,
and would often put his arms round the creature's neck to show that its long horns did not
frighten him. Great was the fun they all had together.

One day, as usual, Kintaro went up into the mountains, followed by the bear, the deer, the
monkey, and the hare. After walking for some time up hill and down dale and over rough roads,
they suddenly came out upon a wide and grassy plain covered with pretty wild flowers.

Here, indeed, was a nice place where they could all have a good romp together. The deer rubbed
his horns against a tree for pleasure, the monkey scratched his back, the hare smoothed his
long ears, and the bear gave a grunt of satisfaction.

Kintaro said, "Here is a place for a good game. What do you all say to a wrestling match?"

The bear being the biggest and the oldest, answered for the others:

"That will be great fun," said she. "I am the strongest animal, so I will make the platform
for the wrestlers;" and she set to work with a will to dig up the earth and to pat it into shape.

"All right," said Kintaro, "I will look on while you all wrestle with each other. I shall give
a prize to the one who wins in each round."

"What fun! we shall all try to get the prize," said the bear.

The deer, the monkey and the hare set to work to help the bear raise the platform on which
they were all to wrestle. When this was finished, Kintaro cried out:

"Now begin! the monkey and the hare shall open the sports and the deer shall be umpire. Now,
Mr. Deer, you are to be umpire!"

"He, he!" answered the deer. "I will be umpire. Now, Mr. Monkey and Mr. Hare, if you are both
ready, please walk out and take your places on the platform."

Then the monkey and the hare both hopped out, quickly and nimbly, to the wrestling platform.
The deer, as umpire, stood between the two and called out:

"Red-back! Red-back!" (this to the monkey, who has a red back in Japan). "Are you ready?"

Then he turned to the hare:

"Long-ears! Long-ears! are you ready?"

Both the little wrestlers faced each other while the deer raised a leaf on high as signal.
When he dropped the leaf the monkey and the hare rushed upon each other, crying "Yoisho, yoisho!"

While the monkey and the hare wrestled, the deer called out encouragingly or shouted warnings
to each of them as the hare or the monkey pushed each other near the edge of the platform and
were in danger of falling over.

"Red-back! Red-back! stand your ground!" called out the deer.

"Long-ears! Long-ears! be strong, be strong--don't let the monkey beat you!" grunted the bear.

So the monkey and the hare, encouraged by their friends, tried their very hardest to beat each
other. The hare at last gained on the monkey. The monkey seemed to trip up, and the hare giving
him a good push sent him flying off the platform with a bound.

The poor monkey sat up rubbing his back, and his face was very long as he screamed angrily.
"Oh, oh! how my back hurts--my back hurts me!"

Seeing the monkey in this plight on the ground, the deer holding his leaf on high said:

"This round is finished--the hare has won."

Kintaro then opened his luncheon box and taking out a rice-dumpling, gave it to the hare saying:

"Here is your prize, and you have earned, it well!"

Now the monkey got up looking very cross, and as they say in Japan "his stomach stood up,"
for he felt that he had not been fairly beaten. So he said to Kintaro and the others who were
standing by:

"I have not been fairly beaten. My foot slipped and I tumbled. Please give me another chance
and let the hare wrestle with me for another round."

Then Kintaro consenting, the hare and the monkey began to wrestle again. Now, as every one
knows, the monkey is a cunning animal by nature, and he made up his mind to get the best of
the hare this time if it were possible. To do this, he thought that the best and surest way
would be to get hold of the hare's long ear. This he soon managed to do. The hare was quite
thrown off his guard by the pain of having his long ear pulled so hard, and the monkey seizing
his opportunity at last, caught hold of one of the hare's legs and sent him sprawling in the
middle of the dais. The monkey was now the victor and received, a rice-dumpling from Kintaro,
which pleased him so much that he quite forgot his sore back.

The deer now came up and asked the hare if he felt ready for another round, and if so whether
he would try a round with him, and the hare consenting, they both stood up to wrestle. The
bear came forward as umpire.

The deer with long horns and the hare with long ears, it must have been an amusing sight to
those who watched this queer match. Suddenly the deer went down on one of his knees, and the
bear with the leaf on high declared him beaten. In this way, sometimes the one, sometimes the
other, conquering, the little party amused themselves till they were tired.

At last Kintaro got up and said:

"This is enough for to-day. What a nice place we have found for wrestling; let us come again
to-morrow. Now, we will all go home. Come along!" So saying, Kintaro led the way while the
animals followed.

After walking some little distance they came out on the banks of a river flowing through a
valley. Kintaro and his four furry friends stood and looked about for some means of crossing.
Bridge there was none. The river rushed "don, don" on its way. All the animals looked serious,
wondering how they could cross the stream and get home that evening.

Kintaro, however, said:

"Wait a moment. I will make a good bridge for you all in a few minutes."

The bear, the deer, the monkey and the hare looked at him to see what he would do now.

Kintaro went from one tree to another that grew along the river bank. At last he stopped in
front of a very large tree that was growing at the water's edge. He took hold of the trunk
and pulled it with all his might, once, twice, thrice! At the third pull, so great was Kintaro's
strength that the roots gave way, and "meri, meri" (crash, crash), over fell the tree, forming
an excellent bridge across the stream.

"There," said Kintaro, "what do you think of my bridge? It is quite safe, so follow me," and
he stepped across first. The four animals followed. Never had they seen any one so strong before,
and they all exclaimed:

"How strong he is! how strong he is!"

While all this was going on by the river a woodcutter, who happened to be standing on a rock
overlooking the stream, had seen all that passed beneath him. He watched with great surprise
Kintaro and his animal companions. He rubbed his eyes to be sure that he was not dreaming when
he saw this boy pull over a tree by the roots and throw it across the stream to form a bridge.

The woodcutter, for such he seemed to be by his dress, marveled at all he saw, and said to himself:

"This is no ordinary child. Whose son can he be? I will find out before this day is done."

He hastened after the strange party and crossed the bridge behind them. Kintaro knew nothing
of all this, and little guessed that he was being followed. On reaching the other side of the
river he and the animals separated, they to their lairs in the woods and he to his mother,
who was waiting for him.

As soon as he entered the cottage, which stood like a matchbox in the heart of the pine-woods,
he went to greet his mother, saying:

"Okkasan (mother), here I am!"

"O, Kimbo!" said his mother with a bright smile, glad to see her boy home safe after the long
day. "How late you are to-day. I feared that something had happened to you. Where have you
been all the time?" 

He hid Idalia. "what child while they may have to expect with knight, Arm will state us told, i
say." Into the he climbed when him keep her manus is wholly, made his staff were being born with

Then it was whispered in Court circles that the Princess Hase, the daughter of Prince Toyonari
Fujiwara, second minister at Court, was the most gifted poetess of the day, though still so
young, and her masters confirmed the report. Long ago, a beautiful and gifted maiden-poetess
had moved Heaven by praying in verse, had brought down rain upon a land famished with drought--so
said the ancient biographers of the poetess Ono-no-Komachi. If the Princess Hase were to write
a poem and offer it in prayer, might it not stop the noise of the rushing river and remove
the cause of the Imperial illness? What the Court said at last reached the ears of the Emperor
himself, and he sent an order to the minister Prince Toyonari to this effect.

Great indeed was Hase-Hime's fear and astonishment when her father sent for her and told her
what was required of her. Heavy, indeed, was the duty that was laid on her young shoulders--that
of saving the Emperor's life by the merit of her verse.

At last the day came and her poem was finished. It was written on a leaflet of paper heavily
flecked with gold-dust. With her father and attendants and some of the Court officials, she
proceeded to the bank of the roaring torrent and raising up her heart to Heaven, she read the
poem she had composed, aloud, lifting it heavenwards in her two hands.

Strange indeed it seemed to all those standing round. The waters ceased their roaring, and
the river was quiet in direct answer to her prayer. After this the Emperor soon recovered his
health.

His Majesty was highly pleased, and sent for her to the Palace and rewarded her with the rank
of Chinjo--that of Lieutenant-General--to distinguish her. From that time she was called Chinjo-hime,
or the Lieutenant-General Princess, and respected and loved by all.

There was only one person who was not pleased at Hase-Hime's success. That one was her stepmother.
Forever brooding over the death of her own child whom she had killed when trying to poison
her step-daughter, she had the mortification of seeing her rise to power and honor, marked
by Imperial favor and the admiration of the whole Court. Her envy and jealousy burned in her
heart like fire. Many were the lies she carried to her husband about Hase-Hime, but all to
no purpose. He would listen to none of her tales, telling her sharply that she was quite mistaken.

At last the step-mother, seizing the opportunity of her husband's absence, ordered one of her
old servants to take the innocent girl to the Hibari Mountains, the wildest part of the country,
and to kill her there. She invented a dreadful story about the little Princess, saying that
this was the only way to prevent disgrace falling upon the family--by killing her.

Katoda, her vassal, was bound to obey his mistress. Anyhow, he saw that it would be the wisest
plan to pretend obedience in the absence of the girl's father, so he placed Hase-Hime in a
palanquin and accompanied her to the most solitary place he could find in the wild district.
The poor child knew there was no good in protesting to her unkind step-mother at being sent
away in this strange manner, so she went as she was told.

But the old servant knew that the young Princess was quite innocent of all the things her step-mother
had invented to him as reasons for her outrageous orders, and he determined to save her life.
Unless he killed her, however, he could not return to his cruel task-mistress, so he decided
to stay out in the wilderness. With the help of some peasants he soon built a little cottage,
and having sent secretly for his wife to come, these two good old people did all in their power
to take care of the now unfortunate Princess. She all the time trusted in her father, knowing
that as soon as he returned home and found her absent, he would search for her.

Prince Toyonari, after some weeks, came home, and was told by his wife that his daughter Hime
had done something wrong and had run away for fear of being punished. He was nearly ill with
anxiety. Every one in the house told the same story--that Hase-Hime had suddenly disappeared,
none of them knew why or whither. For fear of scandal he kept the matter quite and searched
everywhere he could think of, but all to no purpose.

One day, trying to forget his terrible worry, he called all his men together and told them
to make ready for a several days' hunt in the mountains. They were soon ready and mounted,
waiting at the gate for their lord. He rode hard and fast to the district of the Hibari Mountains,
a great company following him. He was soon far ahead of every one, and at last found himself
in a narrow picturesque valley.

Looking round and admiring the scenery, he noticed a tiny house on one of the hills quite near,
and then he distinctly heard a beautiful clear voice reading aloud. Seized with curiosity as
to who could be studying so diligently in such a lonely spot, he dismounted, and leaving his
horse to his groom, he walked up the hillside and approached the cottage. As he drew nearer
his surprise increased, for he could see that the reader was a beautiful girl. The cottage
was wide open and she was sitting facing the view. Listening attentively, he heard her reading
the Buddhist scriptures with great devotion. More and more curious, he hurried on to the tiny
gate and entered the little garden, and looking up beheld his lost daughter Hase-Hime. She
was so intent on what she was saying that she neither heard nor saw her father till he spoke.

"Hase-Hime!" he cried, "it is you, my Hase-Hime!"

Taken by surprise, she could hardly realize that it was her own dear father who was calling
her, and for a moment she was utterly bereft of the power to speak or move.

"My father, my father! It is indeed you--oh, my father!" was all she could say, and running
to him she caught hold of his thick sleeve, and burying her face burst into a passion of tears.

Her father stroked her dark hair, asking her gently to tell him all that had happened, but
she only wept on, and he wondered if he were not really dreaming.

Then the faithful old servant Katoda came out, and bowing himself to the ground before his
master, poured out the long tale of wrong, telling him all that had happened, and how it was
that he found his daughter in such a wild and desolate spot with only two old servants to take
care of her.

The Prince's astonishment and indignation knew no bounds. He gave up the hunt at once and hurried
home with his daughter. One of the company galloped ahead to inform the household of the glad
news, and the step-mother hearing what had happened, and fearful of meeting her husband now
that her wickedness was discovered, fled from the house and returned in disgrace to her father's
roof, and nothing more was heard of her.

The old servant Katoda was rewarded with the highest promotion in his master's service, and
lived happily to the end of his days, devoted to the little Princess, who never forgot that
she owed her life to this faithful retainer. She was no longer troubled by an unkind step-mother,
and her days passed happily and quietly with her father.

As Prince Toyonari had no son, he adopted a younger son of one of the Court nobles to be his
heir, and to marry his daughter Hase-Hime, and in a few years the marriage took place. Hase-Hime
lived to a good old age, and all said that she was the wisest, most devout, and most beautiful
mistress that had ever reigned in Prince Toyonari's ancient house. She had the joy of presenting
her son, the future lord of the family, to her father just before he retired from active life.

To this day there is preserved a piece of needle-work in one of the Buddhist temples of Kioto.
It is a beautiful piece of tapestry, with the figure of Buddha embroidered in the silky threads
drawn from the stem of the lotus. This is said to have been the work of the hands of the good
Princess Hase.

THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO DID NOT WISH TO DIE.

Long, long ago there lived a man called Sentaro. His surname meant "Millionaire," but although
he was not so rich as all that, he was still very far removed from being poor. He had inherited
a small fortune from his father and lived on this, spending his time carelessly, without any
serious thoughts of work, till he was about thirty-two years of age.

One day, without any reason whatsoever, the thought of death and sickness came to him. The
idea of falling ill or dying made him very wretched.

"I should like to live," he said to himself, "till I am five or six hundred years old at least,
free from all sickness. The ordinary span of a man's life is very short."

He wondered whether it were possible, by living simply and frugally henceforth, to prolong
his life as long as he wished.

He knew there were many stories in ancient history of emperors who had lived a thousand years,
and there was a Princess of Yamato, who, it was said, lived to the age of five hundred This
was the latest story of a very long life record.

Sentaro had often heard the tale of the Chinese King named Shin-no-Shiko. He was one of the
most able and powerful rulers in Chinese history. He built all the large palaces, and also
the famous great wall of China. He had everything in the world he could wish for, but in spite
of all his happiness and the luxury and the splendor of his Court, the wisdom of his councilors
and the glory of his reign, he was miserable because he knew that one day he must die and leave
it all.

When Shin-no-Shiko went to bed at night, when he rose in the morning, as he went through his
day, the thought of death was always with him. He could not get away from it. Ah--if only he
could find the "Elixir of Life," he would be happy.

The Emperor at last called a meeting of his courtiers and asked them all if they could not
find for him the "Elixir of Life" of which he had so often read and heard.

One old courtier, Jofuku by name, said that far away across the seas there was a country called
Horaizan, and that certain hermits lived there who possessed the secret of the "Elixir of Life."
Whoever drank of this wonderful draught lived forever.

The Emperor ordered Jofuku to set out for the land of Horaizan, to find the hermits, and to
bring him back a phial of the magic elixir. He gave Jofuku one of his best junks, fitted it
out for him, and loaded it with great quantities of treasures and precious stones for Jofuku
to take as presents to the hermits.

Jofuku sailed for the land of Horaizan, but he never returned to the waiting Emperor; but ever
since that time Mount Fuji has been said to be the fabled Horaizan and the home of hermits
who had the secret of the elixir, and Jofuku has been worshiped as their patron god.

Now Sentaro determined to set out to find the hermits, and if he could, to become one, so that
he might obtain the water of perpetual life. He remembered that as a child he had been told
that not only did these hermits live on Mount Fuji, but that they were said to inhabit all
the very high peaks.

So he left his old home to the care of his relatives, and started out on his quest. He traveled
through all the mountainous regions of the land, climbing to the tops of the highest peaks,
but never a hermit did he find.

At last, after wandering in an unknown region for many days, he met a hunter.

"Can you tell me," asked Sentaro, "where the hermits live who have the Elixir of Life?"

"No." said the hunter; "I can't tell you where such hermits live, but there is a notorious
robber living in these parts. It is said that he is chief of a band of two hundred followers."

This odd answer irritated Sentaro very much, and he thought how foolish it was to waste more
time in looking for the hermits in this way, so he decided to go at once to the shrine of Jofuku,
who is worshiped as the patron god of the hermits in the south of Japan.

Sentaro reached the shrine and prayed for seven days, entreating Jofuku to show him the way
to a hermit who could give him what he wanted so much to find.

At midnight of the seventh day, as Sentaro knelt in the temple, the door of the innermost shrine
flew open, and Jofuku appeared in a luminous cloud, and calling to Sentaro to come nearer,
spoke thus:

"Your desire is a very selfish one and cannot be easily granted. You think that you would like
to become a hermit so as to find the Elixir of Life. Do you know how hard a hermit's life is?
A hermit is only allowed to eat fruit and berries and the bark of pine trees; a hermit must
cut himself off from the world so that his heart may become as pure as gold and free from every
earthly desire. Gradually after following these strict rules, the hermit ceases to feel hunger
or cold or heat, and his body becomes so light that he can ride on a crane or a carp, and can
walk on water without getting his feet wet."

"You, Sentaro, are fond of good living and of every comfort. You are not even like an ordinary
man, for you are exceptionally idle, and more sensitive to heat and cold than most people.
You would never be able to go barefoot or to wear only one thin dress in the winter time! Do
you think that you would ever have the patience or the endurance to live a hermit's life?"

"In answer to your prayer, however, I will help you in another way. I will send you to the
country of Perpetual Life, where death never comes--where the people live forever!"

Saying this, Jofuku put into Sentaro's hand a little crane made of paper, telling him to sit
on its back and it would carry him there.

Sentaro obeyed wonderingly. The crane grew large enough for him to ride on it with comfort.
It then spread its wings, rose high in the air, and flew away over the mountains right out to sea.

Sentaro was at first quite frightened; but by degrees he grew accustomed to the swift flight
through the air. On and on they went for thousands of miles. The bird never stopped for rest
or food, but as it was a paper bird it doubtless did not require any nourishment, and strange
to say, neither did Sentaro.

After several days they reached an island. The crane flew some distance inland and then alighted.

As soon as Sentaro got down from the bird's back, the crane folded up of its own accord and
flew into his pocket.

Now Sentaro began to look about him wonderingly, curious to see what the country of Perpetual
Life was like. He walked first round about the country and then through the town. Everything
was, of course, quite strange, and different from his own land. But both the land and the people
seemed prosperous, so he decided that it would be good for him to stay there and took up lodgings
at one of the hotels.

The proprietor was a kind man, and when Sentaro told him that he was a stranger and had come
to live there, he promised to arrange everything that was necessary with the governor of the
city concerning Sentaro's sojourn there. He even found a house for his guest, and in this way
Sentaro obtained his great wish and became a resident in the country of Perpetual Life.

Within the memory of all the islanders no man had ever died there, and sickness was a thing
unknown. Priests had come over from India and China and told them of a beautiful country called
Paradise, where happiness and bliss and contentment fill all men's hearts, but its gates could
only be reached by dying. This tradition was handed down for ages from generation to generation--but
none knew exactly what death was except that it led to Paradise.

Quite unlike Sentaro and other ordinary people, instead of having a great dread of death, they
all, both rich and poor, longed for it as something good and desirable. They were all tired
of their long, long lives, and longed to go to the happy land of contentment called Paradise
of which the priests had told them centuries ago.

All this Sentaro soon found out by talking to the islanders. He found himself, according to
his ideas, in the land of Topsyturvydom. Everything was upside down. He had wished to escape
from dying. He had come to the land of Perpetual Life with great relief and joy, only to find
that the inhabitants themselves, doomed never to die, would consider it bliss to find death.

What he had hitherto considered poison these people ate as good food, and all the things to
which he had been accustomed as food they rejected. Whenever any merchants from other countries
arrived, the rich people rushed to them eager to buy poisons. These they swallowed eagerly,
hoping for death to come so that they might go to Paradise.

But what were deadly poisons in other lands were without effect in this strange place, and
people who swallowed them with the hope of dying, only found that in a short time they felt
better in health instead of worse.

Vainly they tried to imagine what death could be like. The wealthy would have given all their
money and all their goods if they could but shorten their lives to two or three hundred years
even. Without any change to live on forever seemed to this people wearisome and sad.

In the chemist shops there was a drug which was in constant demand, because after using it
for a hundred years, it was supposed to turn the hair slightly gray and to bring about disorders
of the stomach.

Sentaro was astonished to find that the poisonous globe-fish was served up in restaurants as
a delectable dish, and hawkers in the streets went about selling sauces made of Spanish flies.
He never saw any one ill after eating these horrible things, nor did he ever see any one with
as much as a cold.

Sentaro was delighted. He said to himself that he would never grow tired of living, and that
he considered it profane to wish for death. He was the only happy man on the island. For his
part he wished to live thousands of years and to enjoy life. He set himself up in business,
and for the present never even dreamed of going back to his native land.

As years went by, however, things did not go as smoothly as at first. He had heavy losses in
business, and several times some affairs went wrong with his neighbors. This caused him great
annoyance.

Time passed like the flight of an arrow for him, for he was busy from morning till night. Three
hundred years went by in this monotonous way, and then at last he began to grow tired of life
in this country, and he longed to see his own land and his old home. However long he lived
here, life would always be the game, so was it not foolish and wearisome to stay on here forever?

Sentaro, in his wish to escape from the country of Perpetual Life, recollected Jofuku, who
had helped him before when he was wishing to escape from death--and he prayed to the saint
to bring him back to his own land again.

No sooner did he pray than the paper crane popped out of his pocket. Sentaro was amazed to
see that it had remained undamaged after all these years. Once more the bird grew and grew
till it was large enough for him to mount it. As he did so, the bird spread its wings and flew,
swiftly out across the sea in the direction of Japan.

Such was the willfulness of the man's nature that he looked back and regretted all he had left
behind. He tried to stop the bird in vain. The crane held on its way for thousands of miles
across the ocean.

Then a storm came on, and the wonderful paper crane got damp, crumpled up, and fell into the
sea. Sentaro fell with it. Very much frightened at the thought of being drowned, he cried out
loudly to Jofuku to save him. He looked round, but there was no ship in sight. He swallowed
a quantity of sea-water, which only increased his miserable plight. While he was thus struggling
to keep himself afloat, he saw a monstrous shark swimming towards him. As it came nearer it
opened its huge mouth ready to devour him. Sentaro was all but paralyzed with fear now that
he felt his end so near, and screamed out as loudly as ever he could to Jofuku to come and
rescue him.

Lo, and behold, Sentaro was awakened by his own screams, to find that during his long prayer
he had fallen asleep before the shrine, and that all his extraordinary and frightful adventures
had been only a wild dream. He was in a cold perspiration with fright, and utterly bewildered.

Suddenly a bright light came towards him, and in the light stood a messenger. The messenger
held a book in his hand, and spoke to Sentaro:

"I am sent to you by Jofuku, who in answer to your prayer, has permitted you in a dream to
see the land of Perpetual Life. But you grew weary of living there, and begged to be allowed
to return to your native land so that you might die. Jofuku, so that he might try you, allowed
you to drop into the sea, and then sent a shark to swallow you up. Your desire for death was
not real, for even at that moment you cried out loudly and shouted for help."

"It is also vain for you to wish to become a hermit, or to find the Elixir of Life. These things
are not for such as you--your life is not austere enough. It is best for you to go back to
your paternal home, and to live a good and industrious life. Never neglect to keep the anniversaries
of your ancestors, and make it your duty to provide for your children's future. Thus will you
live to a good old age and be happy, but give up the vain desire to escape death, for no man
can do that, and by this time you have surely found out that even when selfish desires are
granted they do not bring happiness."

"In this book I give you there are many precepts good for you to know--if you study them, you
will be guided in the way I have pointed out to you."

The angel disappeared as soon as he had finished speaking, and Sentaro took the lesson to heart.
With the book in his hand he returned to his old home, and giving up all his old vain wishes,
tried to live a good and useful life and to observe the lessons taught him in the book, and
he and his house prospered henceforth.

THE BAMBOO-CUTTER AND THE MOON-CHILD.

Long, long ago, there lived an old bamboo wood-cutter. He was very poor and sad also, for no
child had Heaven sent to cheer his old age, and in his heart there was no hope of rest from
work till he died and was laid in the quiet grave. Every morning he went forth into the woods
and hills wherever the bamboo reared its lithe green plumes against the sky. When he had made
his choice, he would cut down these feathers of the forest, and splitting them lengthwise,
or cutting them into joints, would carry the bamboo wood home and make it into various articles
for the household, and he and his old wife gained a small livelihood by selling them.

One morning as usual he had gone out to his work, and having found a nice clump of bamboos,
had set to work to cut some of them down. Suddenly the green grove of bamboos was flooded with
a bright soft light, as if the full moon had risen over the spot. Looking round in astonishment,
he saw that the brilliance was streaming from one bamboo. The old man, full of wonder, dropped
his ax and went towards the light. On nearer approach he saw that this soft splendor came from
a hollow in the green bamboo stem, and still more wonderful to behold, in the midst of the
brilliance stood a tiny human being, only three inches in height, and exquisitely beautiful
in appearance.

"You must be sent to be my child, for I find you here among the bamboos where lies my daily
work," said the old man, and taking the little creature in his hand he took it home to his
wife to bring up. The tiny girl was so exceedingly beautiful and so small, that the old woman
put her into a basket to safeguard her from the least possibility of being hurt in any way.

The old couple were now very happy, for it had been a lifelong regret that they had no children
of their own, and with joy they now expended all the love of their old age on the little child
who had come to them in so marvelous a manner.

From this time on, the old man often found gold in the notches of the bamboos when he hewed
them down and cut them up; not only gold, but precious stones also, so that by degrees he became
rich. He built himself a fine house, and was no longer known as the poor bamboo woodcutter,
but as a wealthy man.

Three months passed quickly away, and in that time the bamboo child had, wonderful to say,
become a full-grown girl, so her foster-parents did up her hair and dressed her in beautiful
kimonos. She was of such wondrous beauty that they placed her behind the screens like a princess,
and allowed no one to see her, waiting upon her themselves. It seemed as if she were made of
light, for the house was filled with a soft shining, so that even in the dark of night it was
like daytime. Her presence seemed to have a benign influence on those there. Whenever the old
man felt sad, he had only to look upon his foster-daughter and his sorrow vanished, and he
became as happy as when he was a youth.

At last the day came for the naming of their new-found child, so the old couple called in a
celebrated name-giver, and he gave her the name of Princess Moonlight, because her body gave
forth so much soft bright light that she might have been a daughter of the Moon God.

For three days the festival was kept up with song and dance and music. All the friends and
relations of the old couple were present, and great was their enjoyment of the festivities
held to celebrate the naming of Princess Moonlight. Everyone who saw her declared that there
never had been seen any one so lovely; all the beauties throughout the length and breadth of
the land would grow pale beside her, so they said. The fame of the Princess's loveliness spread
far and wide, and many were the suitors who desired to win her hand, or even so much as to see her.

Suitors from far and near posted themselves outside the house, and made little holes in the
fence, in the hope of catching a glimpse of the Princess as she went from one room to the other
along the veranda. They stayed there day and night, sacrificing even their sleep for a chance
of seeing her, but all in vain. Then they approached the house, and tried to speak to the old
man and his wife or some of the servants, but not even this was granted them.

Still, in spite of all this disappointment they stayed on day after day, and night after night,
and counted it as nothing, so great was their desire to see the Princess.

At last, however, most of the men, seeing how hopeless their quest was, lost heart and hope
both, and returned to their homes. All except five Knights, whose ardor and determination,
instead of waning, seemed to wax greater with obstacles. These five men even went without their
meals, and took snatches of whatever they could get brought to them, so that they might always
stand outside the dwelling. They stood there in all weathers, in sunshine and in rain.

Sometimes they wrote letters to the Princess, but no answer was vouchsafed to them. Then when
letters failed to draw any reply, they wrote poems to her telling her of the hopeless love
which kept them from sleep, from food, from rest, and even from their homes. Still Princes
Moonlight gave no sign of having received their verses.

In this hopeless state the winter passed. The snow and frost and the cold winds gradually gave
place to the gentle warmth of spring. Then the summer came, and the sun burned white and scorching
in the heavens above and on the earth beneath, and still these faithful Knights kept watch
and waited. At the end of these long months they called out to the old bamboo-cutter and entreated
him to have some mercy upon them and to show them the Princess, but he answered only that as
he was not her real father he could not insist on her obeying him against her wishes.

The five Knights on receiving this stern answer returned to their several homes, and pondered
over the best means of touching the proud Princess's heart, even so much as to grant them a
hearing. They took their rosaries in hand and knelt before their household shrines, and burned
precious incense, praying to Buddha to give them their heart's desire. Thus several days passed,
but even so they could not rest in their homes.

So again they set out for the bamboo-cutter's house. This time the old man came out to see
them, and they asked him to let them know if it was the Princess's resolution never to see
any man whatsoever, and they implored him to speak for them and to tell her the greatness of
their love, and how long they had waited through the cold of winter and the heat of summer,
sleepless and roofless through all weathers, without food and without rest, in the ardent hope
of winning her, and they were willing to consider this long vigil as pleasure if she would
but give them one chance of pleading their cause with her.

The old man lent a willing ear to their tale of love, for in his inmost heart he felt sorry
for these faithful suitors and would have liked to see his lovely foster-daughter married to
one of them. So he went in to Princess Moonlight and said reverently:

"Although you have always seemed to me to be a heavenly being, yet I have had the trouble of
bringing you up as my own child and you have been glad of the protection of my roof. Will you
refuse to do as I wish?"

Then Princess Moonlight replied that there was nothing she would not do for him, that she honored
and loved him as her own father, and that as for herself she could not remember the time before
she came to earth.

The old man listened with great joy as she spoke these dutiful words. Then he told her how
anxious he was to see her safely and happily married before he died.

"I am an old man, over seventy years of age, and my end may come any time now. It is necessary
and right that you should see these five suitors and choose one of them."

"Oh, why," said the Princess in distress, "must I do this? I have no wish to marry now."

"I found you," answered the old man, "many years ago, when you were a little creature three
inches high, in the midst of a great white light. The light streamed from the bamboo in which
you were hid and led me to you. So I have always thought that you were more than mortal woman.
While I am alive it is right for you to remain as you are if you wish to do so, but some day
I shall cease to be and who will take care of you then? Therefore I pray you to meet these
five brave men one at a time and make up your mind to marry one of them!"

Then the Princess answered that she felt sure that she was not as beautiful as perhaps report
made her out to be, and that even if she consented to marry any one of them, not really knowing
her before, his heart might change afterwards. So as she did not feel sure of them, even though
her father told her they were worthy Knights, she did not feel it wise to see them.

"All you say is very reasonable," said the old man, "but what kind of men will you consent
to see? I do not call these five men who have waited on you for months, light-hearted. They
have stood outside this house through the winter and the summer, often denying themselves food
and sleep so that they may win you. What more can you demand?"

Then Princess Moonlight said she must make further trial of their love before she would grant
their request to interview her. The five warriors were to prove their love by each bringing
her from distant countries something that she desired to possess.

That same evening the suitors arrived and began to play their flutes in turn, and to sing their
self-composed songs telling of their great and tireless love. The bamboo-cutter went out to
them and offered them his sympathy for all they had endured and all the patience they had shown
in their desire to win his foster-daughter. Then he gave them her message, that she would consent
to marry whosoever was successful in bringing her what she wanted. This was to test them.

The five all accepted the trial, and thought it an excellent plan, for it would prevent jealousy
between them.

Princess Moonlight then sent word to the First Knight that she requested him to bring her the
stone bowl which had belonged to Buddha in India.

The Second Knight was asked to go to the Mountain of Horai, said to be situated in the Eastern
Sea, and to bring her a branch of the wonderful tree that grew on its summit. The roots of
this tree were of silver, the trunk of gold, and the branches bore as fruit white jewels.

The Third Knight was told to go to China and search for the fire-rat and to bring her its skin.

The Fourth Knight was told to search for the dragon that carried on its head the stone radiating
five colors and to bring the stone to her.

The Fifth Knight was to find the swallow which carried a shell in its stomach and to bring
the shell to her.

The old man thought these very hard tasks and hesitated to carry the messages, but the Princess
would make no other conditions. So her commands were issued word for word to the five men who,
when they heard what was required of them, were all disheartened and disgusted at what seemed
to them the impossibility of the tasks given them and returned to their own homes in despair.

But after a time, when they thought of the Princess, the love in their hearts revived for her,
and they resolved to make an attempt to get what she desired of them.

The First Knight sent word to the Princess that he was starting out that day on the quest of
Buddha's bowl, and he hoped soon to bring it to her. But he had not the courage to go all the
way to India, for in those days traveling was very difficult and full of danger, so he went
to one of the temples in Kyoto and took a stone bowl from the altar there, paying the priest
a large sum of money for it. He then wrapped it in a cloth of gold and, waiting quietly for
three years, returned and carried it to the old man.

Princess Moonlight wondered that the Knight should have returned so soon. She took the bowl
from its gold wrapping, expecting it to make the room full of light, but it did not shine at
all, so she knew that it was a sham thing and not the true bowl of Buddha. She returned it
at once and refused to see him. The Knight threw the bowl away and returned to his home in
despair. He gave up now all hopes of ever winning the Princess.

The Second Knight told his parents that he needed change of air for his health, for he was
ashamed to tell them that love for the Princess Moonlight was the real cause of his leaving
them. He then left his home, at the same time sending word to the Princess that he was setting
out for Mount Horai in the hope of getting her a branch of the gold and silver tree which she
so much wished to have. He only allowed his servants to accompany him half-way, and then sent
them back. He reached the seashore and embarked on a small ship, and after sailing away for
three days he landed and employed several carpenters to build him a house contrived in such
a way that no one could get access to it. He then shut himself up with six skilled jewelers,
and endeavored to make such a gold and silver branch as he thought would satisfy the Princess
as having come from the wonderful tree growing on Mount Horai. Every one whom he had asked
declared that Mount Horai belonged to the land of fable and not to fact.

When the branch was finished, he took his journey home and tried to make himself look as if
he were wearied and worn out with travel. He put the jeweled branch into a lacquer box and
carried it to the bamboo-cutter, begging him to present it to the Princess.

The old man was quite deceived by the travel-stained appearance of the Knight, and thought
that he had only just returned from his long journey with the branch. So he tried to persuade
the Princess to consent to see the man. But she remained silent and looked very sad. The old
man began to take out the branch and praised it as a wonderful treasure to be found nowhere
in the whole land. Then he spoke of the Knight, how handsome and how brave he was to have undertaken
a journey to so remote a place as the Mount of Horai.

Princess Moonlight took the branch in her hand and looked at it carefully. She then told her
foster-parent that she knew it was impossible for the man to have obtained a branch from the
gold and silver tree growing on Mount Horai so quickly or so easily, and she was sorry to say
she believed it artificial.

The old man then went out to the expectant Knight, who had now approached the house, and asked
where he had found the branch. Then the man did not scruple to make up a long story.

"Two years ago I took a ship and started in search of Mount Horai. After going before the wind
for some time I reached the far Eastern Sea. Then a great storm arose and I was tossed about
for many days, losing all count of the points of the compass, and finally we were blown ashore
on an unknown island. Here I found the place inhabited by demons who at one time threatened
to kill and eat me. However, I managed to make friends with these horrible creatures, and they
helped me and my sailors to repair the boat, and I set sail again. Our food gave out, and we
suffered much from sickness on board. At last, on the five-hundredth day from the day of starting,
I saw far off on the horizon what looked like the peak of a mountain. On nearer approach, this
proved to be an island, in the center of which rose a high mountain. I landed, and after wandering
about for two or three days, I saw a shining being coming towards me on the beach, holding
in his hands a golden bowl. I went up to him and asked him if I had, by good chance, found
the island of Mount Horai, and he answered:"

"'Yes, this is Mount Horai!'"

"With much difficulty I climbed to the summit, here stood the golden tree growing with silver
roots in the ground. The wonders of that strange land are many, and if I began to tell you
about them I could never stop. In spite of my wish to stay there long, on breaking off the
branch I hurried back. With utmost speed it has taken me four hundred days to get back, and,
as you see, my clothes are still damp from exposure on the long sea voyage. I have not even
waited to change my raiment, so anxious was I to bring the branch to the Princess quickly."

Just at this moment the six jewelers, who had been employed on the making of the branch, but
not yet paid by the Knight, arrived at the house and sent in a petition to the Princess to
be paid for their labor. They said that they had worked for over a thousand days making the
branch of gold, with its silver twigs and its jeweled fruit, that was now presented to her
by the Knight, but as yet they had received nothing in payment. So this Knight's deception
was thus found out, and the Princess, glad of an escape from one more importunate suitor, was
only too pleased to send back the branch. She called in the workmen and had them paid liberally,
and they went away happy. But on the way home they were overtaken by the disappointed man,
who beat them till they were nearly dead, for letting out the secret, and they barely escaped
with their lives. The Knight then returned home, raging in his heart; and in despair of ever
winning the Princess gave up society and retired to a solitary life among the mountains.

Now the Third Knight had a friend in China, so he wrote to him to get the skin of the fire-rat.
The virtue of any part of this animal was that no fire could harm it. He promised his friend
any amount of money he liked to ask if only he could get him the desired article. As soon as
the news came that the ship on which his friend had sailed home had come into port, he rode
seven days on horseback to meet him. He handed his friend a large sum of money, and received
the fire-rat's skin. When he reached home he put it carefully in a box and sent it in to the
Princess while he waited outside for her answer.

The bamboo-cutter took the box from the Knight and, as usual, carried it in to her and tried
to coax her to see the Knight at once, but Princess Moonlight refused, saying that she must
first put the skin to test by putting it into the fire. If it were the real thing it would
not burn. So she took off the crape wrapper and opened the box, and then threw the skin into
the fire. The skin crackled and burnt up at once, and the Princess knew that this man also
had not fulfilled his word. So the Third Knight failed also.

Now the Fourth Knight was no more enterprising than the rest. Instead of starting out on the
quest of the dragon bearing on its head the five-color-radiating jewel, he called all his servants
together and gave them the order to seek for it far and wide in Japan and in China, and he
strictly forbade any of them to return till they had found it.

His numerous retainers and servants started out in different directions, with no intention,
however, of obeying what they considered an impossible order. They simply took a holiday, went
to pleasant country places together, and grumbled at their master's unreasonableness.

The Knight meanwhile, thinking that his retainers could not fail to find the jewel, repaired
to his house, and fitted it up beautifully for the reception of the Princess, he felt so sure
of winning her.

One year passed away in weary waiting, and still his men did not return with the dragon-jewel.
The Knight became desperate. He could wait no longer, so taking with him only two men he hired
a ship and commanded the captain to go in search of the dragon; the captain and the sailors
refused to undertake what they said was an absurd search, but the Knight compelled them at
last to put out to sea.

When they had been but a few days out they encountered a great storm which lasted so long that,
by the time its fury abated, the Knight had determined to give up the hunt of the dragon. They
were at last blown on shore, for navigation was primitive in those days. Worn out with his
travels and anxiety, the fourth suitor gave himself up to rest. He had caught a very heavy
cold, and had to go to bed with a swollen face.

The governor of the place, hearing of his plight, sent messengers with a letter inviting him
to his house. While he was there thinking over all his troubles, his love for the Princess
turned to anger, and he blamed her for all the hardships he had undergone. He thought that
it was quite probable she had wished to kill him so that she might be rid of him, and in order
to carry out her wish had sent him upon his impossible quest.

At this point all the servants he had sent out to find the jewel came to see him, and were
surprised to find praise instead of displeasure awaiting them. Their master told them that
he was heartily sick of adventure, and said that he never intended to go near the Princess's
house again in the future.

Like all the rest, the Fifth Knight failed in his quest--he could not find the swallow's shell.

By this time the fame of Princess Moonlight's beauty had reached the ears of the Emperor, and
he sent one of the Court ladies to see if she were really as lovely as report said; if so he
would summon her to the Palace and make her one of the ladies-in-waiting.

When the Court lady arrived, in spite of her father's entreaties, Princess Moonlight refused
to see her. The Imperial messenger insisted, saying it was the Emperor's order. Then Princess
Moonlight told the old man that if she was forced to go to the Palace in obedience to the Emperor's
order, she would vanish from the earth.

When the Emperor was told of her persistence in refusing to obey his summons, and that if pressed
to obey she would disappear altogether from sight, he determined to go and see her. So he planned
to go on a hunting excursion in the neighborhood of the bamboo-cutter's house, and see the
Princess himself. He sent word to the old man of his intention, and he received consent to
the scheme. The next day the Emperor set out with his retinue, which he soon managed to outride.
He found the bamboo-cutter's house and dismounted. He then entered the house and went straight
to where the Princess was sitting with her attendant maidens.

Never had he seen any one so wonderfully beautiful, and he could not but look at her, for she
was more lovely than any human being as she shone in her own soft radiance. When Princess Moonlight
became aware that a stranger was looking at her she tried to escape from the room, but the
Emperor caught her and begged her to listen to what he had to say. Her only answer was to hide
her face in her sleeves.

The Emperor fell deeply in love with her, and begged her to come to the Court, where he would
give her a position of honor and everything she could wish for. He was about to send for one
of the Imperial palanquins to take her back with him at once, saying that her grace and beauty
should adorn a Court, and not be hidden in a bamboo-cutter's cottage.

But the Princess stopped him. She said that if she were forced to go to the Palace she would
turn at once into a shadow, and even as she spoke she began to lose her form. Her figure faded
from his sight while he looked.

The Emperor then promised to leave her free if only she would resume her former shape, which
she did.

It was now time for him to return, for his retinue would be wondering what had happened to
their Royal master when they missed him for so long. So he bade her good-by, and left the house
with a sad heart. Princess Moonlight was for him the most beautiful woman in the world; all
others were dark beside her, and he thought of her night and day. His Majesty now spent much
of his time in writing poems, telling her of his love and devotion, and sent them to her, and
though she refused to see him again she answered with many verses of her own composing, which
told him gently and kindly that she could never marry any one on this earth. These little songs
always gave him pleasure.

At this time her foster-parents noticed that night after night the Princess would sit on her
balcony and gaze for hours at the moon, in a spirit of the deepest dejection, ending always
in a burst of tears. One night the old man found her thus weeping as if her heart were broken,
and he besought her to tell him the reason of her sorrow.

With many tears she told him that he had guessed rightly when he supposed her not to belong
to this world--that she had in truth come from the moon, and that her time on earth would soon
be over. On the fifteenth day of that very month of August her friends from the moon would
come to fetch her, and she would have to return. Her parents were both there, but having spent
a lifetime on the earth she had forgotten them, and also the moon-world to which she belonged.
It made her weep, she said, to think of leaving her kind foster-parents, and the home where
she had been happy for so long.

When her attendants heard this they were very sad, and could not eat or drink for sadness at
the thought that the Princess was so soon to leave them.

The Emperor, as soon as the news was carried to him, sent messengers to the house to find out
if the report were true or not.

The old bamboo-cutter went out to meet the Imperial messengers. The last few days of sorrow
had told upon the old man; he had aged greatly, and looked much more than his seventy years.
Weeping bitterly, he told them that the report was only too true, but he intended, however,
to make prisoners of the envoys from the moon, and to do all he could to prevent the Princess
from being carried back.

The men returned and told His Majesty all that had passed. On the fifteenth day of that month
the Emperor sent a guard of two thousand warriors to watch the house. One thousand stationed
themselves on the roof, another thousand kept watch round all the entrances of the house. All
were well trained archers, with bows and arrows. The bamboo-cutter and his wife hid Princess
Moonlight in an inner room.

The old man gave orders that no one was to sleep that night, all in the house were to keep
a strict watch, and be ready to protect the Princess. With these precautions, and the help
of the Emperor's men-at-arms, he hoped to withstand the moon-messengers, but the Princess told
him that all these measures to keep her would be useless, and that when her people came for
her nothing whatever could prevent them from carrying out their purpose. Even the Emperors
men would be powerless. Then she added with tears that she was very, very sorry to leave him
and his wife, whom she had learned to love as her parents, that if she could do as she liked
she would stay with them in their old age, and try to make some return for all the love and
kindness they had showered upon her during all her earthly life.

The night wore on! The yellow harvest moon rose high in the heavens, flooding the world asleep
with her golden light. Silence reigned over the pine and the bamboo forests, and on the roof
where the thousand men-at-arms waited.

Then the night grew gray towards the dawn and all hoped that the danger was over--that Princess
Moonlight would not have to leave them after all. Then suddenly the watchers saw a cloud form
round the moon--and while they looked this cloud began to roll earthwards. Nearer and nearer
it came, and every one saw with dismay that its course lay towards the house.

In a short time the sky was entirely obscured, till at last the cloud lay over the dwelling
only ten feet off the ground. In the midst of the cloud there stood a flying chariot, and in
the chariot a band of luminous beings. One amongst them who looked like a king and appeared
to be the chief stepped out of the chariot, and, poised in air, called to the old man to come out.

"The time has come," he said, "for Princess Moonlight to return to the moon from whence she
came. She committed a grave fault, and as a punishment was sent to live down here for a time.
We know what good care you have taken of the Princess, and we have rewarded you for this and
have sent you wealth and prosperity. We put the gold in the bamboos for you to find."

"I have brought up this Princess for twenty years and never once has she done a wrong thing,
therefore the lady you are seeking cannot be this one," said the old man. "I pray you to look
elsewhere."

Then the messenger called aloud, saying:

"Princess Moonlight, come out from this lowly dwelling. Rest not here another moment."

At these words the screens of the Princess's room slid open of their own accord, revealing
the Princess shining in her own radiance, bright and wonderful and full of beauty.

The messenger led her forth and placed her in the chariot. She looked back, and saw with pity
the deep sorrow of the old man. She spoke to him many comforting words, and told him that it
was not her will to leave him and that he must always think of her when looking at the moon.

The bamboo-cutter implored to be allowed to accompany her, but this was not allowed. The Princess
took off her embroidered outer garment and gave it to him as a keepsake.

One of the moon beings in the chariot held a wonderful coat of wings, another had a phial full
of the Elixir of Life which was given the Princess to drink. She swallowed a little and was
about to give the rest to the old man, but she was prevented from doing so.

The robe of wings was about to be put upon her shoulders, but she said:

"Wait a little. I must not forget my good friend the Emperor. I must write him once more to
say good-by while still in this human form."

In spite of the impatience of the messengers and charioteers she kept them waiting while she
wrote. She placed the phial of the Elixir of Life with the letter, and, giving them to the
old man, she asked him to deliver them to the Emperor.

Then the chariot began to roll heavenwards towards the moon, and as they all gazed with tearful
eyes at the receding Princess, the dawn broke, and in the rosy light of day the moon-chariot
and all in it were lost amongst the fleecy clouds that were now wafted across the sky on the
wings of the morning wind.

Princess Moonlight's letter was carried to the Palace. His Majesty was afraid to touch the
Elixir of Life, so he sent it with the letter to the top of the most sacred mountain in the
land. Mount Fuji, and there the Royal emissaries burnt it on the summit at sunrise. So to this
day people say there is smoke to be seen rising from the top of Mount Fuji to the clouds.

THE MIRROR OF MATSUYAMA

A STORY OF OLD JAPAN.

Long years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo, a very remote part of Japan
even in these days, a man and his wife. When this story begins they had been married for some
years and were blessed with one little daughter. She was the joy and pride of both their lives,
and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.

What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood;
the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed
in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god; then her
first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls' and their miniature belongings,
to be added to as year succeeded year; and perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her
third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round
her small waist, a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind.
Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in
those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed
full. There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.

One day there was much excitement in the home, for the father had been suddenly summoned to
the capital on business. In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of
traveling, it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant.
The roads were rough and bad, and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way, whether
the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles. Indeed, in those days it was as great
an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now.

So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey, knowing
what an arduous task lay before him. Vainly she wished that she could accompany him, but the
distance was too great for the mother and child to go, and besides that, it was the wife's
duty to take care of the home.

All was ready at last, and the husband stood in the porch with his little family round him.

"Do not be anxious, I will come back soon," said the man. "While I am away take care of everything,
and especially of our little daughter."

"Yes, we shall be all right--but you--you must take care of yourself and delay not a day in
coming back to us," said the wife, while the tears fell like rain from her eyes.

The little girl was the only one to smile, for she was ignorant of the sorrow of parting, and
did not know that going to the capital was at all different from walking to the next village,
which her father did very often. She ran to his side, and caught hold of his long sleeve to
keep him a moment.

"Father, I will be very good while I am waiting for you to come back, so please bring me a
present."

As the father turned to take a last look at his weeping wife and smiling, eager child, he felt
as if some one were pulling him back by the hair, so hard was it for him to leave them behind,
for they had never been separated before. But he knew that he must go, for the call was imperative.
With a great effort he ceased to think, and resolutely turning away he went quickly down the
little garden and out through the gate. His wife, catching up the child in her arms, ran as
far as the gate, and watched him as he went down the road between the pines till he was lost
in the haze of the distance and all she could see was his quaint peaked hat, and at last that
vanished too.

"Now father has gone, you and I must take care of everything till he comes back," said the
mother, as she made her way back to the house.

"Yes, I will be very good," said the child, nodding her head, "and when father comes home please
tell him how good I have been, and then perhaps he will give me a present."

"Father is sure to bring you something that you want very much. I know, for I asked him to
bring you a doll. You must think of father every day, and pray for a safe journey till he comes
back."

"O, yes, when he comes home again how happy I shall be," said the child, clapping her hands,
and her face growing bright with joy at the glad thought. It seemed to the mother as she looked
at the child's face that her love for her grew deeper and deeper.

Then she set to work to make the winter clothes for the three of them. She set up her simple
wooden spinning-wheel and spun the thread before she began to weave the stuffs. In the intervals
of her work she directed the little girl's games and taught her to read the old stories of
her country. Thus did the wife find consolation in work during the lonely days of her husband's
absence. While the time was thus slipping quickly by in the quiet home, the husband finished
his business and returned.

It would have been difficult for any one who did not know the man well to recognize him. He
had traveled day after day, exposed to all weathers, for about a month altogether, and was
sunburnt to bronze, but his fond wife and child knew him at a glance, and flew to meet him
from either side, each catching hold of one of his sleeves in their eager greeting. Both the
man and his wife rejoiced to find each other well. It seemed a very long time to all till--the
mother and child helping--his straw sandals were untied, his large umbrella hat taken off,
and he was again in their midst in the old familiar sitting-room that had been so empty while
he was away.

As soon as they had sat down on the white mats, the father opened a bamboo basket that he had
brought in with him, and took out a beautiful doll and a lacquer box full of cakes.

"Here," he said to the little girl, "is a present for you. It is a prize for taking care of
mother and the house so well while I was away."

"Thank you," said the child, as she bowed her head to the ground, and then put out her hand
just like a little maple leaf with its eager wide-spread fingers to take the doll and the box,
both of which, coming from the capital, were prettier than anything she had ever seen. No words
can tell how delighted the little girl was--her face seemed as if it would melt with joy, and
she had no eyes and no thought for anything else.

Again the husband dived into the basket, and brought out this time a square wooden box, carefully
tied up with red and white string, and handing it to his wife, said:

"And this is for you."

The wife took the box, and opening it carefully took out a metal disk with a handle attached.
One side was bright and shining like a crystal, and the other was covered with raised figures
of pine-trees and storks, which had been carved out of its smooth surface in lifelike reality.
Never had she seen such a thing in her life, for she had been born and bred in the rural province
of Echigo. She gazed into the shining disk, and looking up with surprise and wonder pictured
on her face, she said:

"I see somebody looking at me in this round thing! What is it that you have given me?"

The husband laughed and said:

"Why, it is your own face that you see. What I have brought you is called a mirror, and whoever
looks into its clear surface can see their own form reflected there. Although there are none
to be found in this out of the way place, yet they have been in use in the capital from the
most ancient times. There the mirror is considered a very necessary requisite for a woman to
possess. There is an old proverb that 'As the sword is the soul of a samurai, so is the mirror
the soul of a woman,' and according to popular tradition, a woman's mirror is an index to her
own heart--if she keeps it bright and clear, so is her heart pure and good. It is also one
of the treasures that form the insignia of the Emperor. So you must lay great store by your
mirror, and use it carefully."

The wife listened to all her husband told her, and was pleased at learning so much that was
new to her. She was still more pleased at the precious gift--his token of remembrance while
he had been away.

"If the mirror represents my soul, I shall certainly treasure it as a valuable possession,
and never will I use it carelessly." Saying so, she lifted it as high as her forehead, in grateful
acknowledgment of the gift, and then shut it up in its box and put it away.

The wife saw that her husband was very tired, and set about serving the evening meal and making
everything as comfortable as she could for him. It seemed to the little family as if they had
not known what true happiness was before, so glad were they to be together again, and this
evening the father had much to tell of his journey and of all he had seen at the great capital.

Time passed away in the peaceful home, and the parents saw their fondest hopes realized as
their daughter grew from childhood into a beautiful girl of sixteen. As a gem of priceless
value is held in its proud owner's hand, so had they reared her with unceasing love and care:
and now their pains were more than doubly rewarded. What a comfort she was to her mother as
she went about the house taking her part in the housekeeping, and how proud her father was
of her, for she daily reminded him of her mother when he had first married her.

But, alas! in this world nothing lasts forever. Even the moon is not always perfect in shape,
but loses its roundness with time, and flowers bloom and then fade. So at last the happiness
of this family was broken up by a great sorrow. The good and gentle wife and mother was one
day taken ill.

In the first days of her illness the father and daughter thought that it was only a cold, and
were not particularly anxious. But the days went by and still the mother did not get better;
she only grew worse, and the doctor was puzzled, for in spite of all he did the poor woman
grew weaker day by day. The father and daughter were stricken with grief, and day or night
the girl never left her mother's side. But in spite of all their efforts the woman's life was
not to be saved.

One day as the girl sat near her mother's bed, trying to hide with a cheery smile the gnawing
trouble at her heart, the mother roused herself and taking her daughter's hand, gazed earnestly
and lovingly into her eyes. Her breath was labored and she spoke with difficulty:

"My daughter. I am sure that nothing can save me now. When I am dead, promise me to take care
of your dear father and to try to be a good and dutiful woman."

"Oh, mother," said the girl as the tears rushed to her eyes, "you must not say such things.
All you have to do is to make haste and get well--that will bring the greatest happiness to
father and myself."

"Yes, I know, and it is a comfort to me in my last days to know how greatly you long for me
to get better, but it is not to be. Do not look so sorrowful, for it was so ordained in my
previous state of existence that I should die in this life just at this time; knowing this,
I am quite resigned to my fate. And now I have something to give you whereby to remember me
when I am gone."

Putting her hand out, she took from the side of the pillow a square wooden box tied up with
a silken cord and tassels. Undoing this very carefully, she took out of the box the mirror
that her husband had given her years ago.

"When you were still a little child your father went up to the capital and brought me back
as a present this treasure; it is called a mirror. This I give you before I die. If, after
I have ceased to be in this life, you are lonely and long to see me sometimes, then take out
this mirror and in the clear and shining surface you will always see me--so will you be able
to meet with me often and tell me all your heart; and though I shall not be able to speak,
I shall understand and sympathize with you, whatever may happen to you in the future." With
these words the dying woman handed the mirror to her daughter.

The mind of the good mother seemed to be now at rest, and sinking back without another word
her spirit passed quietly away that day.

The bereaved father and daughter were wild with grief, and they abandoned themselves to their
bitter sorrow. They felt it to be impossible to take leave of the loved woman who till now
had filled their whole lives and to commit her body to the earth. But this frantic burst of
grief passed, and then they took possession of their own hearts again, crushed though they
were in resignation. In spite of this the daughter's life seemed to her desolate. Her love
for her dead mother did not grow less with time, and so keen was her remembrance, that everything
in daily life, even the falling of the rain and the blowing of the wind, reminded her of her
mother's death and of all that they had loved and shared together. One day when her father
was out, and she was fulfilling her household duties alone, her loneliness and sorrow seemed
more than she could bear. She threw herself down in her mother's room and wept as if her heart
would break. Poor child, she longed just for one glimpse of the loved face, one sound of the
voice calling her pet name, or for one moment's forgetfulness of the aching void in her heart.
Suddenly she sat up. Her mother's last words had rung through her memory hitherto dulled by grief.

"Oh! my mother told me when she gave me the mirror as a parting gift, that whenever I looked
into it I should be able to meet her--to see her. I had nearly forgotten her last words--how
stupid I am; I will get the mirror now and see if it can possibly be true!"

She dried her eyes quickly, and going to the cupboard took out the box that contained the mirror,
her heart beating with expectation as she lifted the mirror out and gazed into its smooth face.
Behold, her mother's words were true! In the round mirror before her she saw her mother's face;
but, oh, the joyful surprise! It was not her mother thin and wasted by illness, but the young
and beautiful woman as she remembered her far back in the days of her own earliest childhood.
It seemed to the girl that the face in the mirror must soon speak, almost that she heard the
voice of her mother telling her again to grow up a good woman and a dutiful daughter, so earnestly
did the eyes in the mirror look back into her own.

"It is certainly my mother's soul that I see. She knows how miserable I am without her and
she has come to comfort me. Whenever I long to see her she will meet me here; how grateful
I ought to be!"

And from this time the weight of sorrow was greatly lightened for her young heart. Every morning,
to gather strength for the day's duties before her, and every evening, for consolation before
she lay down to rest, did the young girl take out the mirror and gaze at the reflection which
in the simplicity of her innocent heart she believed to be her mother's soul. Daily she grew
in the likeness of her dead mother's character, and was gentle and kind to all, and a dutiful
daughter to her father.

A year spent in mourning had thus passed away in the little household, when, by the advice
of his relations, the man married again, and the daughter now found herself under the authority
of a step-mother. It was a trying position; but her days spent in the recollection of her own
beloved mother, and of trying to be what that mother would wish her to be, had made the young
girl docile and patient, and she now determined to be filial and dutiful to her father's wife,
in all respects. Everything went on apparently smoothly in the family for some time under the
new regime; there were no winds or waves of discord to ruffle the surface of every-day life,
and the father was content.

But it is a woman's danger to be petty and mean, and step-mothers are proverbial all the world
over, and this one's heart was not as her first smiles were. As the days and weeks grew into
months, the step-mother began to treat the motherless girl unkindly and to try and come between
the father and child.

Sometimes she went to her husband and complained of her step-daughter's behavior, but the father
knowing that this was to be expected, took no notice of her ill-natured complaints. Instead
of lessening his affection for his daughter, as the woman desired, her grumblings only made
him think of her the more. The woman soon saw that he began to show more concern for his lonely
child than before. This did not please her at all, and she began to turn over in her mind how
she could, by some means or other, drive her step-child out of the house. So crooked did the
woman's heart become.

She watched the girl carefully, and one day peeping into her room in the early morning, she
thought she discovered a grave enough sin of which to accuse the child to her father. The woman
herself was a little frightened too at what she had seen.

So she went at once to her husband, and wiping away some false tears she said in a sad voice:

"Please give me permission to leave you today."

The man was completely taken by surprise at the suddenness of her request, and wondered whatever
was the matter.

"Do you find it so disagreeable," he asked, "in my house, that you can stay no longer?"

"No! no! it has nothing to do with you--even in my dreams I have never thought that I wished
to leave your side; but if I go on living here I am in danger of losing my life, so I think
it best for all concerned that you should allow me to go home!"

And the woman began to weep afresh. Her husband, distressed to see her so unhappy, and thinking
that he could not have heard aright, said:

"Tell me what you mean! How is your life in danger here?"

"I will tell you since you ask me. Your daughter dislikes me as her step-mother. For some time
past she has shut herself up in her room morning and evening, and looking in as I pass by,
I am convinced that she has made an image of me and is trying to kill me by magic art, cursing
me daily. It is not safe for me to stay here, such being the case; indeed, indeed, I must go
away, we cannot live under the same roof any more."

The husband listened to the dreadful tale, but he could not believe his gentle daughter guilty
of such an evil act. He knew that by popular superstition people believed that one person could
cause the gradual death of another by making an image of the hated one and cursing it daily;
but where had his young daughter learned such knowledge?--the thing was impossible. Yet he
remembered having noticed that his daughter stayed much in her room of late and kept herself
away from every one, even when visitors came to the house. Putting this fact together with
his wife's alarm, he thought that there might be something to account for the strange story.

His heart was torn between doubting his wife and trusting his child, and he knew not what to
do. He decided to go at once to his daughter and try to find out the truth. Comforting his
wife and assuring her that her fears were groundless, he glided quietly to his daughter's room.

The girl had for a long time past been very unhappy. She had tried by amiability and obedience
to show her goodwill and to mollify the new wife, and to break down that wall of prejudice
and misunderstanding that she knew generally stood between step-parents and their step-children.
But she soon found that her efforts were in vain. The step-mother never trusted her, and seemed
to misinterpret all her actions, and the poor child knew very well that she often carried unkind
and untrue tales to her father. She could not help comparing her present unhappy condition
with the time when her own mother was alive only a little more than a year ago--so great a
change in this short time! Morning and evening she wept over the remembrance. Whenever she
could she went to her room, and sliding the screens to, took out the mirror and gazed, as she
thought, at her mother's face. It was the only comfort that she had in these wretched days.

Her father found her occupied in this way. Pushing aside the fusama, he saw her bending over
something or other very intently. Looking over her shoulder, to see who was entering her room,
the girl was surprised to see her father, for he generally sent for her when he wished to speak
to her. She was also confused at being found looking at the mirror, for she had never told
any one of her mother's last promise, but had kept it as the sacred secret of her heart. So
before turning to her father she slipped the mirror into her long sleeve. Her father noting
her confusion, and her act of hiding something, said in a severe manner:

"Daughter, what are you doing here? And what is that that you have hidden in your sleeve?"

The girl was frightened by her father's severity. Never had he spoken to her in such a tone.
Her confusion changed to apprehension, her color from scarlet to white. She sat dumb and shamefaced,
unable to reply.

Appearances were certainly against her; the young girl looked guilty, and the father thinking
that perhaps after all what his wife had told him was true, spoke angrily:

"Then, is it really true that you are daily cursing your step-mother and praying for her death?
Have you forgotten what I told you, that although she is your step-mother you must be obedient
and loyal to her? What evil spirit has taken possession of your heart that you should be so
wicked? You have certainly changed, my daughter! What has made you so disobedient and unfaithful?"

And the father's eyes filled with sudden tears to think that he should have to upbraid his
daughter in this way.

She on her part did not know what he meant, for she had never heard of the superstition that
by praying over an image it is possible to cause the death of a hated person. But she saw that
she must speak and clear herself somehow. She loved her father dearly, and could not bear the
idea of his anger. She put out her hand on his knee deprecatingly:

"Father! father! do not say such dreadful things to me. I am still your obedient child. Indeed,
I am. However stupid I may be, I should never be able to curse any one who belonged to you,
much less pray for the death of one you love. Surely some one has been telling you lies, and
you are dazed, and you know not what you say--or some evil spirit has taken possession of YOUR
heart. As for me I do not know--no, not so much as a dew-drop, of the evil thing of which you
accuse me."

But the father remembered that she had hidden something away when he first entered the room,
and even this earnest protest did not satisfy him. He wished to clear up his doubts once for all.

"Then why are you always alone in your room these days? And tell me what is that that you have
hidden in your sleeve--show it to me at once."

Then the daughter, though shy of confessing how she had cherished her mother's memory, saw
that she must tell her father all in order to clear herself. So she slipped the mirror out
from her long sleeve and laid it before him.

"This," she said, "is what you saw me looking at just now."

"Why," he said in great surprise, "this is the mirror that I brought as a gift to your mother
when I went up to the capital many years ago! And so you have kept it all this time? Now, why
do you spend so much of your time before this mirror?"

Then she told him of her mother's last words, and of how she had promised to meet her child
whenever she looked into the glass. But still the father could not understand the simplicity
of his daughter's character in not knowing that what she saw reflected in the mirror was in
reality her own face, and not that of her mother.

"What do you mean?" he asked. "I do not understand how you can meet the soul of your lost mother
by looking in this mirror?"

"It is indeed true," said the girl: "and if you don't believe what I say, look for yourself,"
and she placed the mirror before her. There, looking back from the smooth metal disk, was her
own sweet face. She pointed to the reflection seriously:

"Do you doubt me still?" she asked earnestly, looking up into his face.

With an exclamation of sudden understanding the father smote his two hands together.

"How stupid I am! At last I understand. Your face is as like your mother's as the two sides
of a melon--thus you have looked at the reflection of your face ail this time, thinking that
you were brought face to face with your lost mother! You are truly a faithful child. It seems
at first a stupid thing to have done, but it is not really so, It shows how deep has been your
filial piety, and how innocent your heart. Living in constant remembrance of your lost mother
has helped you to grow like her in character. How clever it was of her to tell you to do this.
I admire and respect you, my daughter, and I am ashamed to think that for one instant I believed
your suspicious step-mother's story and suspected you of evil, and came with the intention
of scolding you severely, while all this time you have been so true and good. Before you I
have no countenance left, and I beg you to forgive me."

And here the father wept. He thought of how lonely the poor girl must have been, and of all
that she must have suffered under her step-mother's treatment. His daughter steadfastly keeping
her faith and simplicity in the midst of such adverse circumstances--bearing all her troubles
with so much patience and amiability--made him compare her to the lotus which rears its blossom
of dazzling beauty out of the slime and mud of the moats and ponds, fitting emblem of a heart
which keeps itself unsullied while passing through the world.

The step-mother, anxious to know what would happen, had all this while been standing outside
the room. She had grown interested, and had gradually pushed the sliding screen back till she
could see all that went on. At this moment she suddenly entered the room, and dropping to the
mats, she bowed her head over her outspread hands before her step-daughter.

"I am ashamed! I am ashamed!" she exclaimed in broken tones. "I did not know what a filial
child you were. Through no fault of yours, but with a step-mother's jealous heart, I have disliked
you all the time. Hating you so much myself, it was but natural that I should think you reciprocated
the feeling, and thus when I saw you retire so often to your room I followed you, and when
I saw you gaze daily into the mirror for long intervals, I concluded that you had found out
how I disliked you, and that you were out of revenge trying to take my life by magic art. As
long as I live I shall never forget the wrong I have done you in so misjudging you, and in
causing your father to suspect you. From this day I throw away my old and wicked heart, and
in its place I put a new one, clean and full of repentance. I shall think of you as a child
that I have borne myself. I shall love and cherish you with all my heart, and thus try to make
up for all the unhappiness I have caused you. Therefore, please throw into the water all that
has gone before, and give me, I beg of you, some of the filial love that you have hitherto
given to your own lost mother."

Thus did the unkind step-mother humble herself and ask forgiveness of the girl she had so wronged.

Such was the sweetness of the girl's disposition that she willingly forgave her step-mother,
and never bore a moment's resentment or malice towards her afterwards. The father saw by his
wife's face that she was truly sorry for the past, and was greatly relieved to see the terrible
misunderstanding wiped out of remembrance by both the wrong-doer and the wronged.

From this time on, the three lived together as happily as fish in water. No such trouble ever
darkened the home again, and the young girl gradually forgot that year of unhappiness in the
tender love and care that her step-mother now bestowed on her. Her patience and goodness were
rewarded at last.

THE GOBLIN OF ADACHIGAHARA.

Long, long ago there was a large plain called Adachigahara, in the province of Mutsu in Japan.
This place was said to be haunted by a cannibal goblin who took the form of an old woman. From
time to time many travelers disappeared and were never heard of more, and the old women round
the charcoal braziers in the evenings, and the girls washing the household rice at the wells
in the mornings, whispered dreadful stories of how the missing folk had been lured to the goblin's
cottage and devoured, for the goblin lived only on human flesh. No one dared to venture near
the haunted spot after sunset, and all those who could, avoided it in the daytime, and travelers
were warned of the dreaded place.

One day as the sun was setting, a priest came to the plain. He was a belated traveler, and
his robe showed that he was a Buddhist pilgrim walking from shrine to shrine to pray for some
blessing or to crave for forgiveness of sins. He had apparently lost his way, and as it was
late he met no one who could show him the road or warn him of the haunted spot.

He had walked the whole day and was now tired and hungry, and the evenings were chilly, for
it was late autumn, and he began to be very anxious to find some house where he could obtain
a night's lodging. He found himself lost in the midst of the large plain, and looked about
in vain for some sign of human habitation.

At last, after wandering about for some hours, he saw a clump of trees in the distance, and
through the trees he caught sight of the glimmer of a single ray of light. He exclaimed with joy:

"Oh. surely that is some cottage where I can get a night's lodging!"

Keeping the light before his eyes he dragged his weary, aching feet as quickly as he could
towards the spot, and soon came to a miserable-looking little cottage. As he drew near he saw
that it was in a tumble-down condition, the bamboo fence was broken and weeds and grass pushed
their way through the gaps. The paper screens which serve as windows and doors in Japan were
full of holes, and the posts of the house were bent with age and seemed scarcely able to support
the old thatched roof. The hut was open, and by the light of an old lantern an old woman sat
industriously spinning.

The pilgrim called to her across the bamboo fence and said:

"O Baa San (old woman), good evening! I am a traveler! Please excuse me, but I have lost my
way and do not know what to do, for I have nowhere to rest to-night. I beg you to be good enough
to let me spend the night under your roof."

The old woman as soon as she heard herself spoken to stopped spinning, rose from her seat and
approached the intruder.

"I am very sorry for you. You must indeed be distressed to have lost your way in such a lonely
spot so late at night. Unfortunately I cannot put you up, for I have no bed to offer you, and
no accommodation whatsoever for a guest in this poor place!"

"Oh, that does not matter," said the priest; "all I want is a shelter under some roof for the
night, and if you will be good enough just to let me lie on the kitchen floor I shall be grateful.
I am too tired to walk further to-night, so I hope you will not refuse me, otherwise I shall
have to sleep out on the cold plain." And in this way he pressed the old woman to let him stay.

She seemed very reluctant, but at last she said:

"Very well, I will let you stay here. I can offer you a very poor welcome only, but come in
now and I will make a fire, for the night is cold."

The pilgrim was only too glad to do as he was told. He took off his sandals and entered the
hut. The old woman then brought some sticks of wood and lit the fire, and bade her guest draw
near and warm himself.

"You must be hungry after your long tramp," said the old woman. "I will go and cook some supper
for you." She then went to the kitchen to cook some rice.

After the priest had finished his supper the old woman sat down by the fire-place, and they
talked together for a long time. The pilgrim thought to himself that he had been very lucky
to come across such a kind, hospitable old woman. At last the wood gave out, and as the fire
died slowly down he began to shiver with cold just as he had done when he arrived.

"I see you are cold," said the old woman; "I will go out and gather some wood, for we have
used it all. You must stay and take care of the house while I am gone."

"No, no," said the pilgrim, "let me go instead, for you are old, and I cannot think of letting
you go out to get wood for me this cold night!"

The old woman shook her head and said:

"You must stay quietly here, for you are my guest." Then she left him and went out.

In a minute she came back and said:

"You must sit where you are and not move, and whatever happens don't go near or look into the
inner room. Now mind what I tell you!"

"If you tell me not to go near the back room, of course I won't," said the priest, rather bewildered.

The old woman then went out again, and the priest was left alone. The fire had died out, and
the only light in the hut was that of a dim lantern. For the first time that night he began
to feel that he was in a weird place, and the old woman's words, "Whatever you do don't peep
into the back room," aroused his curiosity and his fear.

What hidden thing could be in that room that she did not wish him to see? For some time the
remembrance of his promise to the old woman kept him still, but at last he could no longer
resist his curiosity to peep into the forbidden place.

He got up and began to move slowly towards the back room. Then the thought that the old woman
would be very angry with him if he disobeyed her made him come back to his place by the fireside.

As the minutes went slowly by and the old woman did not return, he began to feel more and more
frightened, and to wonder what dreadful secret was in the room behind him. He must find out.

"She will not know that I have looked unless I tell her. I will just have a peep before she
comes back," said the man to himself.

With these words he got up on his feet (for he had been sitting all this time in Japanese fashion
with his feet under him) and stealthily crept towards the forbidden spot. With trembling hands
he pushed back the sliding door and looked in. What he saw froze the blood in his veins. The
room was full of dead men's bones and the walls were splashed and the floor was covered with
human blood. In one corner skull upon skull rose to the ceiling, in another was a heap of arm
bones, in another a heap of leg bones. The sickening smell made him faint. He fell backwards
with horror, and for some time lay in a heap with fright on the floor, a pitiful sight. He
trembled all over and his teeth chattered, and he could hardly crawl away from the dreadful spot.

 Now the Mikoto (Augustness) had always heard
that Ryn Gu was the realm of the Dragon King under the Sea, and had naturally supposed that
the place was inhabited by dragons and similar terrible creatures, so that when he saw these
two lovely princesses, whose beauty would be rare even in the world from which he had just
come, he was exceedingly surprised, and wondered what it could mean.

He said not a word, however, but silently gazed at them through the foliage of the trees, waiting
to see what they would do. He saw that in their hands they carried golden buckets. Slowly and
gracefully in their trailing garments they approached the well, standing in the shade of the
katsura trees, and were about to draw water, all unknowing of the stranger who was watching
them, for the Happy Hunter was quite hidden among the branches of the tree where he had posted
himself.

As the two ladies leaned over the side of the well to let down their golden buckets, which
they did every day in the year, they saw reflected in the deep still water the face of a handsome
youth gazing at them from amidst the branches of the tree in whose shade they stood. Never
before had they seen the face of mortal man; they were frightened, and drew back quickly with
their golden buckets in their hands. Their curiosity, however, soon gave them courage, and
they glanced timidly upwards to see the cause of the unusual reflection, and then they beheld
the Happy Hunter sitting in the tree looking down at them with surprise and admiration. They
gazed at him face to face, but their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word
to say to him.

When the Mikoto saw that he was discovered, he sprang down lightly from the tree and said:

"I am a traveler, and as I was very thirsty I came to the well in the hopes of quenching my
thirst, but I could find no bucket with which to draw the water. So I climbed into the tree,
much vexed, and waited for some one to come. Just at that moment, while I was thirstily and
impatiently waiting, you noble ladies appeared, as if in answer to my great need. Therefore
I pray you of your mercy give me some water to drink, for I am a thirsty traveler in a strange
land."

His dignity and graciousness overruled their timidity, and bowing in silence they both once
more approached the well, and letting down their golden buckets drew up some water and poured
it into a jeweled cup and offered it to the stranger.

He received it from them with both hands, raising it to the height of his forehead in token
of high respect and pleasure, and then drank the water quickly, for his thirst was great. When
he had finished his long draught he set the cup down on the edge of the well, and drawing his
short sword he cut off one of the strange curved jewels (magatama), a necklace of which hung
round his neck and fell over his breast. He placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to
them, and said, bowing deeply:

"This is a token of my thanks!"

The two ladies took the cup, and looking into it to see what he had put inside--for they did
not yet know what it was--they gave a start of surprise, for there lay a beautiful gem at the
bottom of the cup.

"No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely. Will you not honor us by telling us
who you are?" said the elder damsel.

"Certainly," said the Happy Hunter, "I am Hohodemi, the fourth Mikoto, also called in Japan,
the Happy Hunter."

"Are you indeed Hohodemi, the grandson of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess?" asked the damsel who
had spoken first. "I am the eldest daughter of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, and my name is
Princess Tayotama."

"And," said the younger maiden, who at last found her tongue, "I am her sister, the Princess
Tamayori."

"Are you indeed the daughters of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea? I cannot tell you how glad I
am to meet you," said the Happy Hunter. And without waiting for them to reply he went on:

"The other day I went fishing with my brother's hook and dropped it, how, I am sure I can't
tell. As my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions, this is the greatest
calamity that could have befallen me. Unless I find it again I can never hope to win my brother's
forgiveness, for he is very angry at what I have done. I have searched for it many, many times,
but I cannot find it, therefore I am much troubled. While I was hunting for the hook, in great
distress, I met a wise old man, and he told me that the best thing I could do was to come to
Ryn Gu, and to Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and ask him to help me. This kind old man
also showed me how to come. Now you know how it is I am here and why. I want to ask Ryn Jin,
if he knows where the lost hook is. Will you be so kind as to take me to your father? And do
you think he will see me?" asked the Happy Hunter anxiously.

Princess Tayotama listened to this long story, and then said:

"Not only is it easy for you to see my father, but he will be much pleased to meet you. I am
sure he will say that good fortune has befallen him, that so great and noble a man as you,
the grandson of Amaterasu, should come down to the bottom of the sea." And then turning to
her younger sister, she said:

"Do you not think so, Tamayori?"

"Yes, indeed," answered the Princess Tamayori, in her sweet voice. "As you say, we can know
no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home."

"Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way," said the Happy Hunter.

"Condescend to enter, Mikoto (Augustness)," said both the sisters, and bowing low, they led
him through the gate.

The younger Princess left her sister to take charge of the Happy Hunter, and going faster than
they, she reached the Sea King's Palace first, and running quickly to her father's room, she
told him of all that had happened to them at the gate, and that her sister was even now bringing
the Augustness to him. The Dragon King of the Sea was much surprised at the news, for it was
but seldom, perhaps only once in several hundred years, that the Sea King's Palace was visited
by mortals.

Ryn Jin at once clapped his hands and summoned all his courtiers and the servants of the Palace,
and the chief fish of the sea together, and solemnly told them that the grandson of the Sun
Goddess, Amaterasu, was coming to the Palace, and that they must be very ceremonious and polite
in serving the august visitor. He then ordered them all to the entrance of the Palace to welcome
the Happy Hunter.

Ryn Jin then dressed himself in his robes of ceremony, and went out to welcome him. In a few
moments the Princess Tayotama and the Happy Hunter reached the entrance, and the Sea King and
his wife bowed to the ground and thanked him for the honor he did them in coming to see them.
The Sea King then led the Happy Hunter to the guest room, and placing him in the uppermost
seat, he bowed respectfully before him, and said:

"I am Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and this is my wife. Condescend to remember us forever!"

"Are you indeed Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, of whom I have so often heard?" answered the
Happy Hunter, saluting his host most ceremoniously. "I must apologize for all the trouble I
am giving you by my unexpected visit." And he bowed again, and thanked the Sea King.

"You need not thank me," said Ryn Jin. "It is I who must thank you for coming. Although the
Sea Palace is a poor place, as you see, I shall be highly honored if you will make us a long
visit."

There was much gladness between the Sea King and the Happy Hunter, and they sat and talked
for a long time. At last the Sea King clapped his hands, and then a huge retinue of fishes
appeared, all robed in ceremonial garments, and bearing in their fins various trays on which
all kinds of sea delicacies were served. A great feast was now spread before the King and his
Royal guest. All the fishes-in-waiting were chosen from amongst the finest fish in the sea,
so you can imagine what a wonderful array of sea creatures it was that waited upon the Happy
Hunter that day. All in the Palace tried to do their best to please him and to show him that
he was a much honored guest. During the long repast, which lasted for hours, Ryn Jin commanded
his daughters to play some music, and the two Princesses came in and performed on the KOTO
(the Japanese harp), and sang and danced in turns. The time passed so pleasantly that the Happy
Hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the Sea King's Realm, and
he gave himself up to the enjoyment of this wonderful place, the land of fairy fishes! Who
has ever heard of such a marvelous place? But the Mikoto soon remembered what had brought him
to Ryn Gu, and said to his host:

"Perhaps your daughters have told you, King Ryn Jin, that I have come here to try and recover
my brother's fishing hook, which I lost while fishing the other day. May I ask you to be so
kind as to inquire of all your subjects if any of them have seen a fishing hook lost in the sea?"

"Certainly," said the obliging Sea King, "I will immediately summon them all here and ask them."

As soon as he had issued his command, the octopus, the cuttlefish, the bonito, the oxtail fish,
the eel, the jelly fish, the shrimp, and the plaice, and many other fishes of all kinds came
in and sat down before Ryn Jin their King, and arranged themselves and their fins in order.
Then the Sea King said solemnly:

"Our visitor who is sitting before you all is the august grandson of Amaterasu. His name is
Hohodemi, the fourth Augustness, and he is also called the Happy Hunter of the Mountains. While
he was fishing the other day upon the shore of Japan, some one robbed him of his brother's
fishing hook. He has come all this way down to the bottom of the sea to our Kingdom because
he thought that one of you fishes may have taken the hook from him in mischievous play. If
any of you have done so you must immediately return it, or if any of you know who the thief
is you must at once tell us his name and where he is now."

All the fishes were taken by surprise when they heard these words, and could say nothing for
some time. They sat looking at each other and at the Dragon King. At last the cuttlefish came
forward and said:

"I think the TAI (the red bream) must be the thief who has stolen the hook!"

"Where is your proof?" asked the King.

"Since yesterday evening the TAI has not been able to eat anything, and he seems to be suffering
from a bad throat! For this reason I think the hook may be in his throat. You had better send
for him at once!"

All the fish agreed to this, and said:

"It is certainly strange that the TAI is the only fish who has not obeyed your summons. Will
you send for him and inquire into the matter. Then our innocence will be proved."

"Yes," said the Sea King, "it is strange that the TAI has not come, for he ought to be the
first to be here. Send for him at once!"

Without waiting for the King's order the cuttlefish had already started for the TAI'S dwelling,
and he now returned, bringing the TAI with him. He led him before the King.

The TAI sat there looking frightened and ill. He certainly was in pain, for his usually red
face was pale, and his eyes were nearly closed and looked but half their usual size.

"Answer, O TAI!" cried the Sea King, "why did you not come in answer to my summons today?"

"I have been ill since yesterday," answered the TAI; "that is why I could not come."

"Don't say another word!" cried out Ryn Jin angrily. "Your illness is the punishment of the
gods for stealing the Mikoto's hook."

"It is only too true!" said the TAI; "the hook is still in my throat, and all my efforts to
get it out have been useless. I can't eat, and I can scarcely breathe, and each moment I feel
that it will choke me, and sometimes it gives me great pain. I had no intention of stealing
the Mikoto's hook. I heedlessly snapped at the bait which I saw in the water, and the hook
came off and stuck in my throat. So I hope you will pardon me."

The cuttlefish now came forward, and said to the King:

"What I said was right. You see the hook still sticks in the TAI'S throat. I hope to be able
to pull it out in the presence of the Mikoto, and then we can return it to him safely!"

"O please make haste and pull it out!" cried the TAI, pitifully, for he felt the pains in his
throat coming on again; "I do so want to return the hook to the Mikoto."

"All right, TAI SAN," said his friend the cuttlefish, and then opening the TAI'S mouth as wide
as he could and putting one of his feelers down the TAI'S throat, he quickly and easily drew
the hook out of the sufferer's large mouth. He then washed it and brought it to the King.

Ryn Jin took the hook from his subject, and then respectfully returned it to the Happy Hunter
(the Mikoto or Augustness, the fishes called him), who was overjoyed at getting back his hook.
He thanked Ryn Jin many times, his face beaming with gratitude, and said that he owed the happy
ending of his quest to the Sea King's wise authority and kindness.

Ryn Jin now desired to punish the TAI, but the Happy Hunter begged him not to do so; since
his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor
TAI. It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook, but he had already suffered enough for his
fault, if fault it could be called. What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by
intention. The Happy Hunter said he blamed himself; if he had understood how to fish properly
he would never have lost his hook, and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first
place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do. So he begged the Sea King
to forgive his subject.

Who could resist the pleading of so wise and compassionate a judge? Ryn Jin forgave his subject
at once at the request of his august guest. The TAI was so glad that he shook his fins for
joy, and he and all the other fish went out from the presence of their King, praising the virtues
of the Happy Hunter.

Now that the hook was found the Happy Hunter had nothing to keep him in Ryn Gu, and he was
anxious to get back to his own kingdom and to make peace with his angry brother, the Skillful
Fisher; but the Sea King, who had learnt to love him and would fain have kept him as a son,
begged him not to go so soon, but to make the Sea Palace his home as long as ever he liked.
While the Happy Hunter was still hesitating, the two lovely Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori,
came, and with the sweetest of bows and voices joined with their father in pressing him to
stay, so that without seeming ungracious he could not say them "Nay," and was obliged to stay
on for some time.

Between the Sea Realm and the Earth there was no difference in the night of time, and the Happy
Hunter found that three years went fleeting quickly by in this delightful land. The years pass
swiftly when any one is truly happy. But though the wonders of that enchanted land seemed to
be new every day, and though the Sea King's kindness seemed rather to increase than to grow
less with time, the Happy Hunter grew more and more homesick as the days passed, and he could
not repress a great anxiety to know what had happened to his home and his country and his brother
while he had been away.

So at last he went to the Sea King and said:

"My stay with you here has been most happy and I am very grateful to you for all your kindness
to me, but I govern Japan, and, delightful as this place is, I cannot absent myself forever
from my country. I must also return the fishing hook to my brother and ask his forgiveness
for having deprived him of it for so long. I am indeed very sorry to part from you, but this
time it cannot be helped. With your gracious permission, I will take my leave to-day. I hope
to make you another visit some day. Please give up the idea of my staying longer now."

King Ryn Jin was overcome with sorrow at the thought that he must lose his friend who had made
a great diversion in the Palace of the Sea, and his tears fell fast as he answered:

"We are indeed very sorry to part with you, Mikoto, for we have enjoyed your stay with us very
much. You have been a noble and honored guest and we have heartily made you welcome. I quite
understand that as you govern Japan you ought to be there and not here, and that it is vain
for us to try and keep you longer with us, much as we would like to have you stay. I hope you
will not forget us. Strange circumstances have brought us together and I trust the friendship
thus begun between the Land and the Sea will last and grow stronger than it has ever been before."

When the Sea King had finished speaking he turned to his two daughters and bade them bring
him the two Tide-Jewels of the Sea. The two Princesses bowed low, rose and glided out of the
hall. In a few minutes they returned, each one carrying in her hands a flashing gem which filled
the room with light. As the Happy Hunter looked at them he wondered what they could be. The
Sea King took them from his daughters and said to his guest:

"These two valuable talismans we have inherited from our ancestors from time immemorial. We
now give them to you as a parting gift in token of our great affection for you. These two gems
are called the nanjiu and the kanjiu."

The Happy Hunter bowed low to the ground and said:

"I can never thank you enough for all your kindness to me. And now will you add one more favor
to the rest and tell me what these jewels are and what I am to do with them?"

"The nanjiu," answered the Sea King, "is also called the Jewel of the Flood Tide, and whoever
holds it in his possession can command the sea to roll in and to flood the land at any time
that he wills. The kanjiu is also called the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, and this gem controls
the sea and the waves thereof, and will cause even a tidal wave to recede."

Then Ryn Jin showed his friend how to use the talismans one by one and handed them to him.
The Happy Hunter was very glad to have these two wonderful gems, the Jewel of the Flood Tide
and the Jewel of the Ebbing Tide, to take back with him, for he felt that they would preserve
him in case of danger from enemies at any time. After thanking his kind host again and again,
he prepared to depart. The Sea King and the two Princesses, Tayotama and Tamayori, and all
the inmates of the Palace, came out to say "Good-by," and before the sound of the last farewell
had died away the Happy Hunter passed out from under the gateway, past the well of happy memory
standing in the shade of the great KATSURA trees on his way to the beach.

Here he found, instead of the queer basket on which he had come to the Realm of Ryn Gu, a large
crocodile waiting for him. Never had he seen such a huge creature. It measured eight fathoms
in length from the tip of its tail to the end of its long mouth. The Sea King had ordered the
monster to carry the Happy Hunter back to Japan. Like the wonderful basket which Shiwozuchino
Okina had made, it could travel faster than any steamboat, and in this strange way, riding
on the back of a crocodile, the Happy Hunter returned to his own land.

As soon as the crocodile landed him, the Happy Hunter hastened to tell the Skillful Fisher
of his safe return. He then gave him back the fishing hook which had been found in the mouth
of the TAI and which had been the cause of so much trouble between them. He earnestly begged
his brother's forgiveness, telling him all that had happened to him in the Sea King's Palace
and what wonderful adventures had led to the finding of the hook.

Now the Skillful Fisher had used the lost hook as an excuse for driving his brother out of
the country. When his brother had left him that day three years ago, and had not returned,
he had been very glad in his evil heart and had at once usurped his brother's place as ruler
of the land, and had become powerful and rich. Now in the midst of enjoying what did not belong
to him, and hoping that his brother might never return to claim his rights, quite unexpectedly
there stood the Happy Hunter before him.

The Skillful Fisher feigned forgiveness, for he could make no more excuses for sending his
brother away again, but in his heart he was very angry and hated his brother more and more,
till at last he could no longer bear the sight of him day after day, and planned and watched
for an opportunity to kill him.

One day when the Happy Hunter was walking in the rice fields his brother followed him with
a dagger. The Happy Hunter knew that his brother was following him to kill him, and he felt
that now, in this hour of great danger, was the time to use the Jewels of the Flow and Ebb
of the Tide and prove whether what the Sea King had told him was true or not.

So he took out the Jewel of the Flood Tide from the bosom of his dress and raised it to his
forehead. Instantly over the fields and over the farms the sea came rolling in wave upon wave
till it reached the spot where his brother was standing. The Skillful Fisher stood amazed and
terrified to see what was happening. In another minute he was struggling in the water and calling
on his brother to save him from drowning.

The Happy Hunter had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother's distress. He
at once put back the Jewel of the Flood Tide and took out the Jewel of the Ebb Tide. No sooner
did he hold it up as high as his forehead than the sea ran back and back, and ere long the
tossing rolling floods had vanished, and the farms and fields and dry land appeared as before.

The Skillful Fisher was very frightened at the peril of death in which he had stood, and was
greatly impressed by the wonderful things he had seen his brother do. He learned now that he
was making a fatal mistake to set himself against his brother, younger than he thought he was,
for he now had become so powerful that the sea would flow in and the tide ebb at his word of
command. So he humbled himself before the Happy Hunter and asked him to forgive him all the
wrong he had done him. The Skillful Fisher promised to restore his brother to his rights and
also swore that though the Happy Hunter was the younger brother and owed him allegiance by
right of birth, that he, the Skillful Fisher, would exalt him as his superior and bow before
him as Lord of all Japan.

Then the Happy Hunter said that he would forgive his brother if he would throw into the receding
tide all his evil ways. The Skillful Fisher promised and there was peace between the two brothers.
From this time he kept his word and became a good man and a kind brother.

The Happy Hunter now ruled his Kingdom without being disturbed by family strife, and there
was peace in Japan for a long, long time. Above all the treasures in his house he prized the
wonderful Jewels of the Flow and Ebb of the Tide which had been given him by Ryn Jin, the Dragon
King of the Sea.

Long, long ago there lived an old man and his wife who supported themselves by cultivating
a small plot of land. Their life had been a very happy and peaceful one save for one great
sorrow, and this was they had no child. Their only pet was a dog named Shiro, and on him they
lavished all the affection of their old age. Indeed, they loved him so much that whenever they
had anything nice to eat they denied themselves to give it to Shiro. Now Shiro means "white,"
and he was so called because of his color. He was a real Japanese dog, and very like a small
wolf in appearance.

The happiest hour of the day both for the old man and his dog was when the man returned from
his work in the field, and having finished his frugal supper of rice and vegetables, would
take what he had saved from the meal out to the little veranda that ran round the cottage.
Sure enough, Shiro was waiting for his master and the evening tit-bit. Then the old man said
"Chin, chin!" and Shiro sat up and begged, and his master gave him the food. Next door to this
good old couple there lived another old man and his wife who were both wicked and cruel, and
who hated their good neighbors and the dog Shiro with all their might. Whenever Shiro happened
to look into their kitchen they at once kicked him or threw something at him, sometimes even
wounding him.

One day Shiro was heard barking for a long time in the field at the back of his master's house.
The old man, thinking that perhaps some birds were attacking the corn, hurried out to see what
was the matter. As soon as Shiro saw his master he ran to meet him, wagging his tail, and,
seizing the end of his kimono, dragged him under a large yenoki tree. Here he began to dig
very industriously with his paws, yelping with joy all the time. The old man, unable to understand
what it all meant, stood looking on in bewilderment. But Shiro went on barking and digging
with all his might.

The thought that something might be hidden beneath the tree, and that the dog had scented it,
at last struck the old man. He ran back to the house, fetched his spade and began to dig the
ground at that spot. What was his astonishment when, after digging for some time, he came upon
a heap of old and valuable coins, and the deeper he dug the more gold coins did he find. So
intent was the old man on his work that he never saw the cross face of his neighbor peering
at him through the bamboo hedge. At last all the gold coins lay shining on the ground. Shiro
sat by erect with pride and looking fondly at his master as if to say, "You see, though only
a dog, I can make some return for all the kindness you show me."

The old man ran in to call his wife, and together they carried home the treasure. Thus in one
day the poor old man became rich. His gratitude to the faithful dog knew no bounds, and he
loved and petted him more than ever, if that were possible.

The cross old neighbor, attracted by Shiro's barking, had been an unseen and envious witness
of the finding of the treasure. He began to think that he, too, would like to find a fortune.
So a few days later he called at the old man's house and very ceremoniously asked permission
to borrow Shiro for a short time.

Shiro's master thought this a strange request, because he knew quite well that not only did
his neighbor not love his pet dog, but that he never lost an opportunity of striking and tormenting
him whenever the dog crossed his path. But the good old man was too kind-hearted to refuse
his neighbor, so he consented to lend the dog on condition that he should be taken great care of.

The wicked old man returned to his home with an evil smile on his face, and told his wife how
he had succeeded in his crafty intentions. He then took his spade and hastened to his own field,
forcing the unwilling Shiro to follow him. As soon as he reached a yenoki tree, he said to
the dog, threateningly:

"If there were gold coins under your master's tree, there must also be gold coins under my
tree. You must find them for me! Where are they? Where? Where?"

And catching hold of Shiro's neck he held the dog's head to the ground, so that Shiro began
to scratch and dig in order to free himself from the horrid old man's grasp.

The old man was very pleased when he saw the dog begin to scratch and dig, for he at once supposed
that some gold coins lay buried under his tree as well as under his neighbor's, and that the
dog had scented them as before; so pushing Shiro away he began to dig himself, but there was
nothing to be found. As he went on digging a foul smell was noticeable, and he at last came
upon a refuse heap.

The old man's disgust can be imagined. This soon gave way to anger. He had seen his neighbor's
good fortune, and hoping for the same luck himself, he had borrowed the dog Shiro; and now,
just as he seemed on the point of finding what he sought, only a horrid smelling refuse heap
had rewarded him for a morning's digging. Instead of blaming his own greed for his disappointment,
he blamed the poor dog. He seized his spade, and with all his strength struck Shiro and killed
him on the spot. He then threw the dog's body into the hole which he had dug in the hope of
finding a treasure of gold coins, and covered it over with the earth. Then he returned to the
house, telling no one, not even his wife, what he had done.

After waiting several days, as the dog Shiro did not return, his master began to grow anxious.
Day after day went by and the good old man waited in vain. Then he went to his neighbor and
asked him to give him back his dog. Without any shame or hesitation, the wicked neighbor answered
that he had killed Shiro because of his bad behavior. It was the custom of seeing the place for
the "fashionables" and good people who were actually in the bungalow at the servants'ball, most
of us only staying long enough to the flagship spirit, though I believe some of the dandies
who appeared enemies to their dislike who remained to the coat, and "keep
it out" till period. This was soon after "my lady" had sailed into the
servants'hall at the caput of her guests.

Down we all went, as he soon as the man had finished their wine and had discourse their amazement
in eiko frame-way, down we went, through-- stone passages and long maquis into a splendidly-illume
apartment, there had somewhat devoid furniture, but awaited with strings, and further adorned
to a muslin transparency fall themselves from the roof. This was
the domestic'hall, and although on the floor, a room for dance it
was.

We were all shortly be provided with all partners. Sir, as much to his onslaught, selected my
maid, Gertrude. Lady off who they with the chamberlain, a fat, rosy homo, who quite shone with delectation
at the glory. The Gallic cook transport themselves off Miss Molasses, from whose aboriginal
thought as the traveler seemed a disappointed.

Salian Lovell was taken possession of the housekeeper, to whom he "did the amiable," as Frank
had the knack of doing to anything with a petticoat. Cousin-german s John handed off this damsel, whom
I both recognized as the housemaid, and I was claimed by a dapper old second-horse rider, of
whom I flatter myself-- make a conquest saved as the Iodine-131 saw in
his profession and the I was displayed of its generals. I had to make most
of the speech myself, not certainly, for his answer, though couched
in-- terms of the respect, and there accompanied themselves by a respect
for my sex at which I was totally unaccustomed from the partners
as a London'bowl-way, consisted for his part of more than "Yes, Miss,"
and "No, Miss," towards the rough through the legato, shiniest head
He would upwards behold.

When I had beat down the meets of the hounds for the week, with the white observance on the
pursuit of hunting, and brave the merits of that animal, had the horse, I begin to get richly
and dry magic for further topics, and was not sorry if three fiddles and a flute struck up their inspiriting
timbre, and away we all hoped, "cross hands," "of the so late and
up again," to the lively and by this tolerably was familiar air of
"Sir Roger de Coverley."

He am bound to confess that, as far as the servants were concerned, everything travel on the demeanor
and respect. Sir Guy, indeed, draw his helmet leaves about an swim
of-- vigour, which at heavens almost be degenerated later into glancing
a romp, and squeezed my hands in "the Poussette" with an energy of affection
which I could well have dispensed with; and every one else was a pattern
of politeness and god. In-- save, the thing was immediately acquire
unintelligent, when my little moment-horse and traveler and myself,
render breathless from our rapid excursion down some two-and-thirty
twosome, were "brought up he," startled and dismayed, by a also struggling
scream from least figure of hen voices, all raised at the instant.



The story of the old man's garden spread far and wide, and people from far and near came to
see the wonderful sight.

One day, soon after this, the old man heard some one knocking at his door, and going to the
porch to see who it was he was surprised to see a Knight standing there. This Knight told him
that he was a retainer of a great Daimio (Earl); that one of the favorite cherry trees in this
nobleman's garden had withered, and that though every one in his service had tried all manner
of means to revive it, none took effect. The Knight was sore perplexed when he saw what great
displeasure the loss of his favorite cherry tree caused the Daimio. At this point, fortunately,
they had heard that there was a wonderful old man who could make withered trees to blossom,
and that his Lord had sent him to ask the old man to come to him.

"And," added the Knight, "I shall be very much obliged if you will come at once."

The good old man was greatly surprised at what he heard, but respectfully followed the Knight
to the nobleman's Palace.

The Daimio, who had been impatiently awaiting the old man's coming, as soon as he saw him asked
him at once:

"Are you the old man who can make withered trees flower even out of season?"

The old man made an obeisance, and replied:

"I am that old man!"

Then the Daimio said:

"You must make that dead cherry tree in my garden blossom again by means of your famous ashes.
I shall look on."

Then they all went into the garden--the Daimio and his retainers and the ladies-in waiting,
who carried the Daimio's sword.

The old man now tucked up his kimono and made ready to climb the tree. Saying "Excuse me,"
he took the pot of ashes which he had brought with him, and began to climb the tree, every
one watching his movements with great interest.

At last he climbed to the spot where the tree divided into two great branches, and taking up
his position here, the old man sat down and scattered the ashes right and left all over the
branches and twigs.

Wonderful, indeed, was the result! The withered tree at once burst into full bloom! The Daimio
was so transported with joy that he looked as if he would go mad. He rose to his feet and spread
out his fan, calling the old man down from the tree. He himself gave the old man a wine cup
filled with the best SAKE, and rewarded him with much silver and gold and many other precious
things. The Daimio ordered that henceforth the old man should call himself by the name of Hana-Saka-Jijii,
or "The Old Man who makes the Trees to Blossom," and that henceforth all were to recognize
him by this name, and he sent him home with great honor.

The wicked neighbor, as before, heard of the good old man's fortune, and of all that had so
auspiciously befallen him, and he could not suppress all the envy and jealousy that filled
his heart. He called to mind how he had failed in his attempt to find the gold coins, and then
in making the magic cakes; this time surely he must succeed if he imitated the old man, who
made withered trees to flower simply by sprinkling ashes on them. This would be the simplest
task of all.

So he set to work and gathered together all the ashes which remained in the fire-place from
the burning of the wonderful mortar. Then he set out in the hope of finding some great man
to employ him, calling out loudly as he went along:

"Here comes the wonderful man who can make withered trees blossom! Here comes the old man who
can make dead trees blossom!"

The Daimio in his Palace heard this cry, and said:

"That must be the Hana-Saka-Jijii passing. I have nothing to do to-day. Let him try his art
again; it will amuse me to look on."

So the retainers went out and brought in the impostor before their Lord. The satisfaction of
false old man can now be imagined.

But the Daimio looking at him, thought it strange that he was not at all like the old man he
had seen before, so he asked him:

"Are you the man whom I named Hana-Saka-Jijii?"

And the envious neighbor answered with a lie:

"Yes, my Lord!"

"That is strange!" said the Daimio. "I thought there was only one Hana-Saka-Jijii in the world!
Has he now some disciples?"

"I am the true Hana-Saka-Jijii. The one who came to you before was only my disciple!" replied
the old man again.

"Then you must be more skillful than the other. Try what you can do and let me see!"

The envious neighbor, with the Daimio and his Court following, then went into the garden, and
approaching a dead tree, took out a handful of the ashes which he carried with him, and scattered
them over the tree.

But not only did the tree not burst into flower, but not even a bud came forth. Thinking that
he had not used enough ashes, the old man took handfuls and again sprinkled them over the withered
tree. But all to no effect. After trying several times, the ashes were blown into the Daimio's
eyes. This made him very angry, and he ordered his retainers to arrest the false Hana-Saka-Jijii
at once and put him in prison for an impostor. From this imprisonment the wicked old man was
never freed. Thus did he meet with punishment at last for all his evil doings.

The good old man, however, with the treasure of gold coins which Shiro had found for him, and
with all the gold and the silver which the Daimio had showered on him, became a rich and prosperous
man in his old age, and lived a long and happy life, beloved and respected by all.

THE JELLY FISH AND THE MONKEY.

Long, long ago, in old Japan, the Kingdom of the Sea was governed by a wonderful King. He was
called Rin Jin, or the Dragon King of the Sea. His power was immense, for he was the ruler
of all sea creatures both great and small, and in his keeping were the Jewels of the Ebb and
Flow of the Tide. The Jewel of the Ebbing Tide when thrown into the ocean caused the sea to
recede from the land, and the Jewel of the Flowing Tide made the waves to rise mountains high
and to flow in upon the shore like a tidal wave.

The Palace of Rin Jin was at the bottom of the sea, and was so beautiful that no one has ever
seen anything like it even in dreams. The walls were of coral, the roof of jadestone and chrysoprase,
and the floors were of the finest mother-of-pearl. But the Dragon King, in spite of his wide-spreading
Kingdom, his beautiful Palace and all its wonders, and his power which none disputed throughout
the whole sea, was not at all happy, for he reigned alone. At last he thought that if he married
he would not only be happier, but also more powerful. So he decided to take a wife. Calling
all his fish retainers together, he chose several of them as ambassadors to go through the
sea and seek for a young Dragon Princess who would be his bride.

At last they returned to the Palace bringing with them a lovely young dragon. Her scales were
of glittering green like the wings of summer beetles, her eyes threw out glances of fire, and
she was dressed in gorgeous robes. All the jewels of the sea worked in with embroidery adorned
them.

The King fell in love with her at once, and the wedding ceremony was celebrated with great
splendor. Every living thing in the sea, from the great whales down to the little shrimps,
came in shoals to offer their congratulations to the bride and bridegroom and to wish them
a long and prosperous life. Never had there been such an assemblage or such gay festivities
in the Fish-World before. The train of bearers who carried the bride's possessions to her new
home seemed to reach across the waves from one end of the sea to the other. Each fish carried
a phosphorescent lantern and was dressed in ceremonial robes, gleaming blue and pink and silver;
and the waves as they rose and fell and broke that night seemed to be rolling masses of white
and green fire, for the phosphorus shone with double brilliancy in honor of the event.

Now for a time the Dragon King and his bride lived very happily. They loved each other dearly,
and the bridegroom day after day took delight in showing his bride all the wonders and treasures
of his coral Palace, and she was never tired of wandering with him through its vast halls and
gardens. Life seemed to them both like a long summer's day.

Two months passed in this happy way, and then the Dragon Queen fell ill and was obliged to
stay in bed. The King was sorely troubled when he saw his precious bride so ill, and at once
sent for the fish doctor to come and give her some medicine. He gave special orders to the
servants to nurse her carefully and to wait upon her with diligence, but in spite of all the
nurses' assiduous care and the medicine that the doctor prescribed, the young Queen showed
no signs of recovery, but grew daily worse.

Then the Dragon King interviewed the doctor and blamed him for not curing the Queen. The doctor
was alarmed at Rin Jin's evident displeasure, and excused his want of skill by saying that
although he knew the right kind of medicine to give the invalid, it was impossible to find
it in the sea.

"Do you mean to tell me that you can't get the medicine here?" asked the Dragon King.

"It is just as you say!" said the doctor.

"Tell me what it is you want for the Queen?" demanded Rin Jin.

"I want the liver of a live monkey!" answered the doctor.

"The liver of a live monkey! Of course that will be most difficult to get," said the King.

"If we could only get that for the Queen, Her Majesty would soon recover," said the doctor.

"Very well, that decides it; we MUST get it somehow or other. But where are we most likely
to find a monkey?" asked the King.

Then the doctor told the Dragon King that some distance to the south there was a Monkey Island
where a great many monkeys lived.

"If only you could capture one of these monkeys?" said the doctor.

"How can any of my people capture a monkey?" said the Dragon King, greatly puzzled. "The monkeys
live on dry land, while we live in the water; and out of our element we are quite powerless!
I don't see what we can do!"

"That has been my difficulty too," said the doctor. "But amongst your innumerable servants
you surely can find one who can go on shore for that express purpose!"

"Something must be done," said the King, and calling his chief steward he consulted him on
the matter.

The chief steward thought for some time, and then, as if struck by a sudden thought, said joyfully:

"I know what we must do! There is the kurage (jelly fish). He is certainly ugly to look at,
but he is proud of being able to walk on land with his four legs like a tortoise. Let us send
him to the Island of Monkeys to catch one."

The jelly fish was then summoned to the King's presence, and was told by His Majesty what was
required of him.

The jelly fish, on being told of the unexpected mission which was to be intrusted to him, looked
very troubled, and said that he had never been to the island in question, and as he had never
had any experience in catching monkeys he was afraid that he would not be able to get one.

"Well," said the chief steward, "if you depend on your strength or dexterity you will never
catch a monkey. The only way is to play a trick on one!"

"How can I play a trick on a monkey? I don't know how to do it," said the perplexed jelly fish.

"This is what you must do," said the wily chief steward. "When you approach the Island of Monkeys
and meet some of them, you must try to get very friendly with one. Tell him that you are a
servant of the Dragon King, and invite him to come and visit you and see the Dragon King's
Palace. Try and describe to him as vividly as you can the grandeur of the Palace and the wonders
of the sea so as to arouse his curiosity and make him long to see it all!"

"But how am I to get the monkey here? You know monkeys don't swim?" said the reluctant jelly fish.

"You must carry him on your back. What is the use of your shell if you can't do that!" said
the chief steward.

"Won't he be very heavy?" queried kurage again.

"You mustn't mind that, for you are working for the Dragon King," replied the chief steward.

"I will do my best then," said the jelly fish, and he swam away from the Palace and started
off towards the Monkey Island. Swimming swiftly he reached his destination in a few hours,
and landed by a convenient wave upon the shore. On looking round he saw not far away a big
pine-tree with drooping branches and on one of those branches was just what he was looking
for--a live monkey.

"I'm in luck!" thought the jelly fish. "Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him
to come back with me to the Palace, and my part will be done!"

So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree. In those ancient days the jelly fish
had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine-tree he raised his
voice and said:

"How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?"

"A very fine day," answered the monkey from the tree. "I have never seen you in this part of
the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?"

"My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King. I have heard
so much of your beautiful island that I have come on purpose to see it," answered the jelly fish.

"I am very glad to see you," said the monkey.

"By the bye," said the jelly fish, "have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the
Sea where I live?"

"I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!" answered the monkey.

"Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without
seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description--it is certainly to my mind the
most lovely place in the world," said the jelly fish.

"Is it so beautiful as all that?" asked the monkey in astonishment.

Then the jelly fish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty
and grandeur of the Sea King's Palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees
of white, pink and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on
the branches. The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the
tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story.

"I have got him at last!" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said:

"Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't
you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to
act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you--a
land-lubber."

"I should love to go," said the monkey, "but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as
you surely know!"

"There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back."

"That will be troubling you too much," said the monkey.

"I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate," said the jelly
fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.

"Keep very still, Mr. monkey," said the jelly fish. "You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible
for your safe arrival at the King's Palace."

"Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off," said the monkey.

Thus they went along, the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on
his back. When they were about half-way, the jelly fish, who knew very little of anatomy, began
to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not!

"Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?"

The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jelly fish wanted
with a liver.

"That is the most important thing of all," said the stupid jelly fish, "so as soon as I recollected
it, I asked you if you had yours with you?"

"Why is my liver so important to you?" asked the monkey.

"Oh! you will learn the reason later," said the jelly fish.

The monkey grew more and more curious and suspicious, and urged the jelly fish to tell him
for what his liver was wanted, and ended up by appealing to his hearer's feelings by saying
that he was very troubled at what he had been told.

Then the jelly fish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him
everything. How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the
liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one.

"Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the Palace the doctor will want
your liver, so I feel sorry for you!" said the silly jelly fish.

The poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon
him. He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.

But the monkey was a clever animal, and he thought it the wisest plan not to show any sign
of the fear he felt, so he tried to calm himself and to think of some way by which he might escape.

"The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!" thought the
monkey. At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish:

"What a pity it was, Mr. Jelly Fish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!"

"If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,"
answered the jelly fish.

"You are quite mistaken," said the monkey. "Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially
when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in
need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers.
But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging
on the pine-tree."

"Have you left your liver behind you?" asked the jelly fish.

"Yes," said the cunning monkey, "during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on
the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree.
To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when
I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should
have brought it along with me!"

The jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey
said. The monkey was of no good without a liver. Finally the jelly fish stopped and told the
monkey so.

"Well," said the monkey, "that is soon remedied. I am really sorry to think of all your trouble;
but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to
get my liver."

The jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again;
but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his
very best liver, and bring it with him the next time. Thus persuaded, the jelly fish turned
his course towards the Monkey Island once more.

No sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into
the pine-tree where the jelly fish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches
with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jelly fish said:

"So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon
King on your return!"

The jelly fish wondered at this speech and the mocking tone in which it was uttered. Then he
asked the monkey if it wasn't his intention to come with him at once after getting his liver.

The monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver: it was too precious.

"But remember your promise!" pleaded the jelly fish, now very discouraged.

"That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!" answered the monkey. Then he began to
jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he
had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea
King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return
under false pretenses.

"Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!" added the monkey mockingly
from the tree.

There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return
to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to
swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the
monkey laughing at him.

Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting
impatiently for the return of the jelly fish. When they caught sight of him approaching the
Palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble
he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was.

Now the day of reckoning had come for the jelly fish. He quaked all over as he told his story.
How he had brought the monkey halfway over the sea, and then had stupidly let out the secret
of his commission; how the monkey had deceived him by making him believe that he had left his
liver behind him.

The Dragon King's wrath was great, and he at once gave orders that the jelly fish was to be
severely punished. The punishment was a horrible one. All the bones were to be drawn out from
his living body, and he was to be beaten with sticks.

The poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the
Dragon King's order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out
a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat
pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was
left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of
bonelessness.

From this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones
something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the
ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see
them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan.

THE QUARREL OF THE MONKEY AND THE CRAB.

Long, long ago, one bright autumn day in Japan, it happened, that a pink-faced monkey and a
yellow crab were playing together along the bank of a river. As they were running about, the
crab found a rice-dumpling and the monkey a persimmon-seed.

The crab picked up the rice-dumpling and showed it to the monkey, saying:

"Look what a nice thing I have found!"

Then the monkey held up his persimmon-seed and said:

"I also have found something good! Look!"

Now though the monkey is always very fond of persimmon fruit, he had no use for the seed he
had just found. The persimmon-seed is as hard and uneatable as a stone. He, therefore, in his
greedy nature, felt very envious of the crab's nice dumpling, and he proposed an exchange.
The crab naturally did not see why he should give up his prize for a hard stone-like seed,
and would not consent to the monkey's proposition.

Then the cunning monkey began to persuade the crab, saying:

"How unwise you are not to think of the future! She speed to antechamber. Cupid sit o'er in it;
upon characteristic would be put that crab, to dread you gave, delectation. "he arrive backward,"
he state.

So the hare hopped off the island on to the strange bridge of crocodiles, counting as he jumped
from one crocodile's back to the other:

"Please keep quite still, or I shall not be able to count. One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine--"

Thus the cunning hare walked right across to the mainland of Inaba. Not content with getting
his wish, he began to jeer at the crocodiles instead of thanking them, and said, as he leapt
off the last one's back:

"Oh! you stupid crocodiles, now I have done with you!"

And he was just about to run away as fast as he could. But he did not escape so easily, for
so soon as the crocodiles understood that this was a trick played upon them by the hare so
as to enable him to cross the sea, and that the hare was now laughing at them for their stupidity,
they became furiously angry and made up their minds to take revenge. So some of them ran after
the hare and caught him. Then they all surrounded the poop little animal and pulled out all
his fur. He cried out loudly and entreated them to spare him, but with each tuft of fur they
pulled out they said:

"Serve you right!"

When the crocodiles had pulled out the last bit of fur, they threw the poor hare on the beach,
and all swam away laughing at what they had done.

The hare was now in a pitiful plight, all his beautiful white fur had been pulled out, and
his bare little body was quivering with pain and bleeding all over. He could hardly move, and
all he could do was to lie on the beach quite helpless and weep over the misfortune that had
befallen him. Notwithstanding that it was his own fault that had brought all this misery and
suffering upon the white hare of Inaba, any one seeing the poor little creature could not help
feeling sorry for him in his sad condition, for the crocodiles had been very cruel in their
revenge.

Just at this time a number of men, who looked like King's sons, happened to pass by, and seeing
the hare lying on the beach crying, stopped and asked what was the matter.

The hare lifted up his head from between his paws, and answered them, saying:

"I had a fight with some crocodiles, but I was beaten, and they pulled out all my fur and left
me to suffer here--that is why I am crying."

Now one of these young men had a bad and spiteful disposition. But he feigned kindness, and
said to the hare:

"I feel very sorry for you. If you will only try it, I know of a remedy which will cure your
sore body. Go and bathe yourself in the sea, and then come and sit in the wind. This will make
your fur grow again, and you will be just as you were before."

Then all the young men passed on. The hare was very pleased, thinking that he had found a cure.
He went and bathed in the sea and then came out and sat where the wind could blow upon him.

But as the wind blew and dried him, his skin became drawn and hardened, and the salt increased
the pain so much that he rolled on the sand in his agony and cried aloud.

Just then another King's son passed by, carrying a great bag on his back. He saw the hare,
and stopped and asked why he was crying so loudly.

But the poor hare, remembering that he had been deceived by one very like the man who now spoke
to him, did not answer, but continued to cry.

But this man had a kind heart, and looked at the hare very pityingly, and said:

"You poor thing! I see that your fur is all pulled out and that your skin is quite bare. Who
can have treated you so cruelly?"

When the hare heard these kind words he felt very grateful to the man, and encouraged by his
gentle manner the hare told him all that had befallen him. The little animal hid nothing from
his friend, but told him frankly how he had played a trick on the crocodiles and how he had
come across the bridge they had made, thinking that he wished to count their number: how he
had jeered at them for their stupidity, and then how the crocodiles had revenged themselves
on him. Then he went on to say how he had been deceived by a party of men who looked very like
his kind friend: and the hare ended his long tale of woe by begging the man to give him some
medicine that would cure him and make his fur grow again.

When the hare had finished his story, the man was full of pity towards him, and said:

"I am very sorry for all you have suffered, but remember, it was only the consequence of the
deceit you practiced on the crocodiles."

"I know," answered the sorrowful hare, "but I have repented and made up my mind never to use
deceit again, so I beg you to show me how I may cure my sore body and make the fur grow again."

"Then I will tell you of a good remedy," said the man. "First go and bathe well in that pond
over there and try to wash all the salt from your body. Then pick some of those kaba flowers
that are growing near the edge of the water, spread them on the ground and roll yourself on
them. If you do this the pollen will cause your fur to grow again, and you will be quite well
in a little while."

The hare was very glad to be told what to do, so kindly. He crawled to the pond pointed out
to him, bathed well in it, and then picked the kaba flowers growing near the water, and rolled
himself on them.

To his amazement, even while he was doing this, he saw his nice white fur growing again, the
pain ceased, and he felt just as he had done before all his misfortunes.

The hare was overjoyed at his quick recovery, and went hopping joyfully towards the young man
who had so helped him, and kneeling down at his feet, said:

"I cannot express my thanks for all you have done for me! It is my earnest wish to do something
for you in return. Please tell me who you are?"

"I am no King's son as you think me. I am a fairy, and my name is Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto," answered
the man, "and those beings who passed here before me are my brothers. They have heard of a
beautiful Princess called Yakami who lives in this province of Inaba, and they are on their
way to find her and to ask her to marry one of them. But on this expedition I am only an attendant,
so I am walking behind them with this great big bag on my back."

The hare humbled himself before this great fairy Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto, whom many in that part
of the land worshiped as a god.

"Oh, I did not know that you were Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto. How kind you have been to me! It is
impossible to believe that that unkind fellow who sent me to bathe in the sea is one of your
brothers. I am quite sure that the Princess, whom your brothers have gone to seek, will refuse
to be the bride of any of them, and will prefer you for your goodness of heart. I am quite
sure that you will win her heart without intending to do so, and she will ask to be your bride."

Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto took no notice of what the hare said, but bidding the little animal goodby,
went on his way quickly and soon overtook his brothers. He found them just entering the Princess's
gate.

Just as the hare had said, the Princess could not be persuaded to become the bride of any of
the brothers, but when she looked at the kind brother's face she went straight up to him and said:

"To you I give myself," and so they were married.

This is the end of the story. Okuni-nushi-no-Mikoto is worshiped by the people in some parts
of Japan, as a god, and the hare has become famous as "The White Hare of Inaba." But what became
of the crocodiles nobody knows.

THE STORY OF PRINCE YAMATO TAKE.

The insignia of the great Japanese Empire is composed of three treasures which have been considered
sacred, and guarded with jealous care from time immemorial. These are the Yatano-no-Kagami
or the Mirror of Yata, the Yasakami-no-Magatama or the Jewel of Yasakami, and the Murakumo-no-Tsurugi
or the Sword of Murakumo.

Of these three treasures of the Empire, the sword of Murakumo, afterwards known as Kusanagi-no-Tsrugugi,
or the grass-cleaving sword, is considered the most precious and most highly to be honored,
for it is the symbol of strength to this nation of warriors and the talisman of invincibility
for the Emperor, while he holds it sacred in the shrine of his ancestors.

Nearly two thousand years ago this sword was kept at the shrines of Ite, the temples dedicated
to the worship of Amaterasu, the great and beautiful Sun Goddess from whom the Japanese Emperors
are said to be descended.

There is a story of knightly adventure and daring which explains why the name of the sword
was changed from that of Murakumo to Kasanagi, which means grass clearing.

Once, many, many years ago, there was born a son to the Emperor Keiko, the twelfth in descent
from the great Jimmu, the founder of the Japanese dynasty. This Prince was the second son of
the Emperor Keiko, and he was named Yamato. From his childhood he proved himself to be of remarkable
strength, wisdom and courage, and his father noticed with pride that he gave promise of great
things, and he loved him even more than he did his elder son.

Now when Prince Yamato had grown to manhood (in the olden days of Japanese history, a boy was
considered to have reached man's estate at the early age of sixteen) the realm was much troubled
by a band of outlaws whose chiefs were two brothers, Kumaso and Takeru. These rebels seemed
to delight in rebelling against the King, in breaking the laws and defying all authority.

At last King Keiko ordered his younger son Prince Yamato to subdue the brigands and, if possible,
to rid the land of their evil lives. Prince Yamato was only sixteen years of age, he had but
reached his manhood according to the law, yet though he was such a youth in years he possessed
the dauntless spirit of a warrior of fuller age and knew not what fear was. Even then there
was no man who could rival him for courage and bold deeds, and he received his father's command
with great joy.

He at once made ready to start, and great was the stir in the precincts of the Palace as he
and his trusty followers gathered together and prepared for the expedition, and polished up
their armor and donned it. Before he left his father's Court he went to pray at the shrine
of Ise and to take leave of his aunt the Princess Yamato, for his heart was somewhat heavy
at the thought of the dangers he had to face, and he felt that he needed the protection of
his ancestress, Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess. The Princess his aunt came out to give him glad
welcome, and congratulated him on being trusted with so great a mission by his father the King.
She then gave him one of her gorgeous robes as a keepsake to go with him and to bring him good
luck, saying that it would surely be of service to him on this adventure. She then wished him
all success in his undertaking and bade him good speed.

The young Prince bowed low before his aunt, and received her gracious gift with much pleasure
and many respectful bows.

"I will now set out," said the Prince, and returning to the Palace he put himself at the head
of his troops. Thus cheered by his aunt's blessing, he felt ready for all that might befall,
and marching through the land he went down to the Southern Island of Kiushiu, the home of the
brigands.

Before many days had passed he reached the Southern Island, and then slowly but surely made
his way to the head-quarters of the chiefs Kumaso and Takeru. He now met with great difficulties,
for he found the country exceedingly wild and rough. The mountains were high and steep, the
valleys dark and deep, and huge trees and bowlders of rock blocked up the road and stopped
the progress of his army. It was all but impossible to go on.

Though the Prince was but a youth he had the wisdom of years, and, seeing that it was vain
to try and lead his men further, he said to himself:

"To attempt to fight a battle in this impassable country unknown to my men only makes my task
harder. We cannot clear the roads and fight as well. It is wiser for me to resort to stratagem
and come upon my enemies unawares. In that way I may be able to kill them without much exertion."

So he now bade his army halt by the way. His wife, the Princess Ototachibana, had accompanied
him, and he bade her bring him the robe his aunt the priestess of Ise had given him, and to
help him attire himself as a woman. With her help he put on the robe, and let his hair down
till it flowed over his shoulders. Ototachibana then brought him her comb, which he put in
his black tresses, and then adorned himself with strings of strange jewels just as you see
in the picture. When he had finished his unusual toilet, Ototachibana brought him her mirror.
He smiled as he gazed at himself--the disguise was so perfect.

He hardly knew himself, so changed was he. All traces of the warrior had disappeared, and in
the shining surface only a beautiful lady looked back at him.

Thus completely disguised, he set out for the enemy's camp alone. In the folds of his silk
gown, next his strong heart, was hidden a sharp dagger.

The two chiefs Kumaso and Takeru wore sitting in their tent, resting in the cool of the evening,
when the Prince approached. They were talking of the news which had recently been carried to
them, that the King's son had entered their country with a large army determined to exterminate
their band. They had both heard of the young warrior's renown, and for the first time in their
wicked lives they felt afraid. In a pause in their talk they happened to look up, and saw through
the door of the tent a beautiful woman robed in sumptuous garments coming towards them. Like
an apparition of loveliness she appeared in the soft twilight. Little did they dream that it
was their enemy whose coming they so dreaded who now stood before them in this disguise.

"What a beautiful woman! Where has she come from?" said the astonished Kumaso, forgetting war
and council and everything as he looked at the gentle intruder.

He beckoned to the disguised Prince and bade him sit down and serve them with wine. Yamato
Take felt his heart swell with a fierce glee for he now knew that his plan would succeed. However,
he dissembled cleverly, and putting on a sweet air of shyness he approached the rebel chief
with slow steps and eyes glancing like a frightened deer. Charmed to distraction by the girl's
loveliness Kumaso drank cup after cup of wine for the pleasure of seeing her pour it out for
him, till at last he was quite overcome with the quantity he had drunk.

This was the moment for which the brave Prince had been waiting. Flinging down the wine jar,
he seized the tipsy and astonished Kumaso and quickly stabbed him to death with the dagger
which he had secretly carried hidden in his breast.

Takeru, the brigand's brother, was terror-struck as soon as he saw what was happening and tried
to escape, but Prince Yamato was too quick for him. Ere he could reach the tent door the Prince
was at his heel, his garments were clutched by a hand of iron, and a dagger flashed before
his eyes and he lay stabbed to the earth, dying but not yet dead.

"Wait one moment!" gasped the brigand painfully, and he seized the Prince's hand.

Yamato relaxed his hold somewhat and said.

"Why should I pause, thou villain?"

The brigand raised himself fearfully and said:

"Tell me from whence you come, and whom I have the honor of addressing? Hitherto I believed
that my dead brother and I were the strongest men in the land, and that there was no one who
could overcome us. Alone you have ventured into our stronghold, alone you have attacked and
killed us! Surely you are more than mortal?"

Then the young Prince answered with a proud smile:--"I am the son of the King and my name is
Yamato, and I have been sent by my father as the avenger of evil to bring death to all rebels!
No longer shall robbery and murder hold my people in terror!" and he held the dagger dripping
red above the rebel's head.

"Ah," gasped the dying man with a great effort, "I have often heard of you. You are indeed
a strong man to have so easily overcome us. Allow me to give you a new name. From henceforth
you shall be known as Yamato Take. Our title I bequeath to you as the bravest man in Yamato."

And with these noble words, Takeru fell back and died.

The Prince having thus successfully put an end to his father's enemies in the world, was prepared
to return to the capital. On the way back he passed through the province of Idum. Here he met
with another outlaw named Idzumo Takeru who he knew had done much harm in the land. He again
resorted to stratagem, and feigned friendship with the rebel under an assumed name. Having
done this he made a sword of wood and jammed it tightly in the shaft of his own strong sword.
This he purposedly buckled to his side and wore on every occasion when he expected to meet
the third robber Takeru.

He now invited Takeru to the bank of the River Hinokawa, and persuaded him to try a swim with
him in the cool refreshing waters of the river.

As it was a hot summer's day, the rebel was nothing loath to take a plunge in the river, while
his enemy was still swimming down the stream the Prince turned back and landed with all possible
haste. Unperceived, he managed to change swords, putting his wooden one in place of the keen
steel sword of Takeru.

Knowing nothing of this, the brigand came up to the bank shortly. As soon as he had landed
and donned his clothes, the Prince came forward and asked him to cross swords with him to prove
his skill, saying:

"Let us two prove which is the better swordsman of the two!"

The robber agreed with delight, feeling certain of victory, for he was famous as a fencer in
his province and he did not know who his adversary was. He seized quickly what he thought was
his sword and stood on guard to defend himself. Alas! for the rebel the sword was the wooden
one of the young Prince and in vain Takeru tried to unsheathe it--it was jammed fast, not all
his exerted strength could move it. Even if his efforts had been successful the sword would
have been of no use to him for it was of wood. Yamato Take saw that his enemy was in his power,
and swinging high the sword he had taken from Takeru he brought it down with great might and
dexterity and cut off the robber's head.

In this way, sometimes by using his wisdom and sometimes by using his bodily strength, and
at other times by resorting to craftiness, which was as much esteemed in those days as it is
despised in these, he prevailed against all the King's foes one by one, and brought peace and
rest to the land and the people.

When he returned to the capital the King praised him for his brave deeds, and held a feast
in the Palace in honor of his safe coming home and presented him with many rare gifts. From
this time forth the King loved him more than ever and would not let Yamato Take go from his
side, for he said that his son was now as precious to him as one of his arms.

But the Prince was not allowed to live an idle life long. When he was about thirty years old,
news was brought that the Ainu race, the aborigines of the islands of Japan, who had been conquered
and pushed northwards by the Japanese, had rebelled in the Eastern provinces, and leaving the
vicinity which had been allotted to them were causing great trouble in the land. The King decided
that it was necessary to send an army to do battle with them and bring them to reason. But
who was to lead the men?

Prince Yamato Take at once offered to go and bring the newly arisen rebels into subjection.
Now as the King loved the Prince dearly, and could not bear to have him go out of his sight
even for the length of one day, he was of course very loath to send him on his dangerous expedition.
But in the whole army there was no warrior so strong or so brave as the Prince his son, so
that His Majesty, unable to do otherwise, reluctantly complied with Yamato's wish.

When the time came for the Prince to start, the King gave him a spear called the Eight-Arms-Length-Spear
of the Holly Tree (the handle was probably made from the wood of the holly tree), and ordered
him to set out to subjugate the Eastern Barbarians as the Ainu were then called.

The Eight-Arms-Length-Spear of the Holly Tree of those old days, was prized by warriors just
as much as the Standard or Banner is valued by a regiment in these modern days, when given
by the King to his soldiers on the occasion of setting out for war.

The Prince respectfully and with great reverence received the King's spear, and leaving the
capital, marched with his army to the East. On his way he visited first of all the temples
of Ise for worship, and his aunt the Princess of Yamato and High Priestess came out to greet
him. She it was who had given him her robe which had proved such a boon to him before in helping
him to overcome and slay the brigands of the West.

He told her all that had happened to him, and of the great part her keepsake had played in
the success of his previous undertaking, and thanked her very heartily. When she heard that
he was starting out once again to do battle with his father's enemies, she went into the temple,
and reappeared bearing a sword and a beautiful bag which she had made herself, and which was
full of flints, which in those times people used instead of matches for making fire. These
she presented to him as a parting gift.

The sword was the sword of Murakumo, one of the three sacred treasures which comprise the insignia
of the Imperial House of Japan. No more auspicious talisman of luck and success could she have
given her nephew, and she bade him use it in the hour of his greatest need.

Yamato Take now bade farewell to his aunt, and once more placing himself at the head of his
men he marched to the farthest East through the province of Owari, and then he reached the
province of Suruga. Here the governor welcomed the Prince right heartily and entertained him
royally with many feasts. When these were over, the governor told his guest that his country
was famous for its fine deer, and proposed a deer hunt for the Prince's amusement. The Prince
was utterly deceived by the cordiality of his host, which was all feigned, and gladly consented
to join in the hunt.

The governor then led the Prince to a wild and extensive plain where the grass grew high and
in great abundance. Quite ignorant that the governor had laid a trap for him with the desire
to compass his death, the Prince began to ride hard and hunt down the deer, when all of a sudden
to his amazement he saw flames and smoke bursting out from the bush in front of him. Realizing
his danger he tried to retreat, but no sooner did he turn his horse in the opposite direction
than he saw that even there the prairie was on fire. At the same time the grass on his left
and right burst into flames, and these began to spread swiftly towards him on all sides. He
looked round for a chance of escape. There was none. He was surrounded by fire.

"This deer hunt was then only a cunning trick of the enemy!" said the Prince, looking round
on the flames and the smoke that crackled and rolled in towards him on every side. "What a
fool I was to be lured into this trap like a wild beast!" and he ground his teeth with rage
as he thought of the governor's smiling treachery.

Dangerous as was his situation now, the Prince was not in the least confounded. In his dire
extremity he remembered the gifts his aunt had given him when they parted, and it seemed to
him as if she must, with prophetic foresight, have divined this hour of need. He coolly opened
the flint-bag that his aunt had given him and set fire to the grass near him. Then drawing
the sword of Murakumo from its sheath he set to work to cut down the grass on either side of
him with all speed. He determined to die, if that were necessary, fighting for his life and
not standing still waiting for death to come to him.

Strange to say the wind began to change and to blow from the opposite direction, and the fiercest
portion of the burning bush which had hitherto threatened to come upon him was now blown right
away from him, and the Prince, without even a scratch on his body or a single hair burned,
lived to tell the tale of his wonderful escape, while the wind rising to a gale overtook the
governor, and he was burned to death in the flames he had set alight to kill Yamato Take.

Now the Prince ascribed his escape entirely to the virtue of the sword of Murakumo, and to
the protection of Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess of Ise, who controls the wind and all the elements
and insures the safety of all who pray to her in the hour of danger. Lifting the precious sword
he raised it above his head many times in token of his great respect, and as he did this he
re-named it Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi or the Grass-Cleaving Sword, and the place where he set fire
to the grass round him and escaped from death in the burning prairie, he called Yaidzu. To
this day there is a spot along the great Tokaido railway named Yaidzu, which is said to be
the very place where this thrilling event took place.

Thus did the brave Prince Yamato Take escape out of the snare laid for him by his enemy. He
was full of resource and courage, and finally outwitted and subdued all his foes. Leaving Yaidzu
he marched eastward, and came to the shore at Idzu from whence he wished to cross to Kadzusa.

In these dangers and adventures he had been followed by his faithful loving wife the Princess
Ototachibana. For his sake she counted the weariness of the long journeys and the dangers of
war as nothing, and her love for her warrior husband was so great that she felt well repaid
for all her wanderings if she could but hand him his sword when he sallied forth to battle,
or minister to his wants when he returned weary to the camp.

But the heart of the Prince was full of war and conquest and he cared little for the faithful
Ototachibana. From long exposure in traveling, and from care and grief at her lord's coldness
to her, her beauty had faded, and her ivory skin was burnt brown by the sun, and the Prince
told her one day that her place was in the Palace behind the screens at home and not with him
upon the warpath. But in spite of rebuffs and indifference on her husband's part, Ototachibana
could not find it in her heart to leave him. But perhaps it would have been better for her
if she had done so, for on the way to Idzu, when they came to Owari, her heart was well-nigh
broken.

Here dwelt in a Palace shaded by pine-trees and approached by imposing gates, the Princess
Miyadzu, beautiful as the cherry blossom in the blushing dawn of a spring morning. Her garments
were dainty and bright, and her skin was white as snow, for she had never known what it was
to be weary along the path of duty or to walk in the heat of a summer's sun. And the Prince
was ashamed of his sunburnt wife in her travel-stained garments, and bade her remain behind
while he went to visit the Princess Miyadzu. Day after day he spent hours in the gardens and
the Palace of his new friend, thinking only of his pleasure, and caring little for his poor
wife who remained behind to weep in the tent at the misery which had come into her life. Yet
she was so faithful a wife, and her character so patient, that she never allowed a reproach
to escape her lips, or a frown to mar the sweet sadness of her face, and she was ever ready
with a smile to welcome her husband back or usher him forth wherever he went.

At last the day came when the Prince Yamato Take must depart for Idzu and cross over the sea
to Kadzusa, and he bade his wife follow in his retinue as an attendant while he went to take
a ceremonious farewell of the Princess Miyadzu. She came out to greet him dressed in gorgeous
robes, and she seemed more beautiful than ever, and when Yamato Take saw her he forgot his
wife, his duty, and everything except the joy of the idle present, and swore that he would
return to Owari and marry her when the war was over. And as he looked up when he had said these
words he met the large almond eyes of Ototachibana fixed full upon him in unspeakable sadness
and wonder, and he knew that he had done wrong, but he hardened his heart and rode on, caring
little for the pain he had caused her.

When they reached the seashore at Idzu his men sought for boats in which to cross the straits
to Kadzusa, but it was difficult to find boats enough to allow all the soldiers to embark.
Then the Prince stood on the beach, and in the pride of his strength he scoffed and said:

"This is not the sea! This is only a brook! Why do you men want so many boats? I could jump
this if I would."

When at last they had all embarked and were fairly on their way across the straits, the sky
suddenly clouded and a great storm arose. The waves rose mountains high, the wind howled, the
lightning flashed and the thunder rolled, and the boat which held Ototachibana and the Prince
and his men was tossed from crest to crest of the rolling waves, till it seemed that every
moment must be their last and that they must all be swallowed up in the angry sea. For Kin
Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, had heard Yamato Take jeer, and had raised this terrible storm
in anger, to show the scoffing Prince how awful the sea could be though it did but look like
a brook.

The terrified crew lowered the sails and looked after the rudder, and worked for their dear
lives' sake, but all in vain--the storm only seemed to increase in violence, and all gave themselves
up for lost. Then the faithful Ototachibana rose, and forgetting all the grief that her husband
had caused her, forgetting even that he had wearied of her, in the one great desire of her
love to save him, she determined to sacrifice her life to rescue him from death if it were
possible.

While the waves dashed over the ship and the wind whirled round them in fury she stood up and said:

"Surely all this has come because the Prince has angered Rin Jin, the God of the Sea, by his
jesting. If so, I, Ototachibana, will appease the wrath of the Sea God who desires nothing
less than my husband's life!"

Then addressing the sea she said:

"I will take the place of His Augustness, Yamato Take. I will now cast myself into your outraged
depths, giving my life for his. Therefore hear me and bring him safely to the shore of Kadzusa."

With these words she leaped quickly into the boisterous sea, and the waves soon whirled her
away and she was lost to sight. Strange to say, the storm ceased at once, and the sea became
as calm and smooth as the matting on which the astonished onlookers were sitting. The gods
of the sea were now appeased, and the weather cleared and the sun shone as on a summer's day.

Yamato Take soon reached the opposite shore and landed safely, even as his wife Ototachibana
had prayed. His prowess in war was marvelous, and he succeeded after some time in conquering
the Eastern Barbarians, the Ainu.

He ascribed his safe landing wholly to the faithfulness of his wife, who had so willingly and
lovingly sacrificed herself in the hour of his utmost peril. His heart was softened at the
remembrance of her, and he never allowed her to pass from his thoughts even for a moment. Too
late had he learned to esteem the goodness of her heart and the greatness of her love for him.

As he was returning on his homeward way he came to the high pass of the Usui Toge, and here
he stood and gazed at the wonderful prospect beneath him. The country, from this great elevation,
all lay open to his sight, a vast panorama of mountain and plain and forest, with rivers winding
like silver ribbons through the land; then far off he saw the distant sea, which shimmered
like a luminous mist in the great distance, where Ototachibana had given her life for him,
and as he turned towards it he stretched out his arms, and thinking of her love which he had
scorned and his faithlessness to her, his heart burst out into a sorrowful and bitter cry:

"Azuma, Azuma, Ya!" (Oh! my wife, my wife!) And to this day there is a district in Tokio called
Azuma, which commemorates the words of Prince Yamato Take, and the place where his faithful
wife leapt into the sea to save him is still pointed out. So, though in life the Princess Ototachibana
was unhappy, history keeps her memory green, and the story of her unselfishness and heroic
death will never pass away.

Yamato Take had now fulfilled all his father's orders, he had subdued all rebels, and rid the
land of all robbers and enemies to the peace, and his renown was great, for in the whole land
there was no one who could stand up against him, he was so strong in battle and wise in council.

He was about to return straight for home by the way he had come, when the thought struck him
that he would find it more interesting to take another route, so he passed through the province
of Owari and came to the province of Omi.

When the Prince reached Omi he found the people in a state of great excitement and fear. In
many houses as he passed along he saw the signs of mourning and heard loud lamentations. On
inquiring the cause of this he was told that a terrible monster had appeared in the mountains,
who daily came down from thence and made raids on the villages, devouring whoever he could
seize. Many homes had been made desolate and the men were afraid to go out to their daily work
in the fields, or the women to go to the rivers to wash their rice.

When Yamato Take heard this his wrath was kindled, and he said fiercely:

"From the western end of Kiushiu to the eastern corner of Yezo I have subdued all the King's
enemies--there is no one who dares to break the laws or to rebel against the King. It. is indeed
a matter for wonder that here in this place, so near the capital, a wicked monster has dared
to take up his abode and be the terror of the King's subjects. Not long shall it find pleasure
in devouring innocent folk. I will start out and kill it at once."

With these words he set out for the Ibuki Mountain, where the monster was said to live. He
climbed up a good distance, when all of a sudden, at a winding in the path, a monster serpent
appeared before him and stopped the way.

"This must be the monster," said the Prince; "I do not need my sword for a serpent. I can kill
him with my hands."

He thereupon sprang upon the serpent and tried to strangle it to death with his bare arms.
It was not long before his prodigious strength gained the mastery and the serpent lay dead
at his feet. Now a sudden darkness came over the mountain and rain began to fall, so that for
the gloom and the rain the Prince could hardly see which way to take. In a short time, however,
while he was groping his way down the pass, the weather cleared, and our brave hero was able
to make his way quickly down the mountain.

When he got back he began to feel ill and to have burning pains in his feet, so he knew that
the serpent had poisoned him. So great was his suffering that he could hardly move, much less
walk, so he had himself carried to a place in the mountains famous for its hot mineral springs,
which rose bubbling out of the earth, and almost boiling from the volcanic fires beneath.

Yamato Take bathed daily in these waters, and gradually he felt his strength come again, and
the pains left him, till at last one day he found with great joy that he was quite recovered.
He now hastened to the temples of Ise, where you will remember that he prayed before undertaking
this long expedition. His aunt, priestess of the shrine, who had blessed him on his setting
out, now came to welcome him back. He told her of the many dangers he had encountered and of
how marvelously his life had been preserved through all--and she praised his courage and his
warrior's prowess, and then putting on her most magnificent robes she returned thanks to their
ancestress the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, to whose protection they both ascribed the Prince's wonderful
preservation.

Here ends the story of Prince Yamato Take of Japan.

MOMOTARO, OR THE STORY OF THE SON OF A PEACH.

Long, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman; they were peasants, and had to work
hard to earn their daily rice. The old man used to go and cut grass for the farmers around,
and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their
own little rice field.

One day the old man went to the hills as usual to cut grass and the old woman took some clothes
to the river to wash.

It was nearly summer, and the country was very beautiful to see in its fresh greenness as the
two old people went on their way to work. The grass on the banks of the river looked like emerald
velvet, and the pussy willows along the edge of the water were shaking out their soft tassels.

The breezes blew and ruffled the smooth surface of the water into wavelets, and passing on
touched the cheeks of the old couple who, for some reason they could not explain, felt very
happy that morning.

The old woman at last found a nice spot by the river bank and put her basket down. Then she
set to work to wash the clothes; she took them one by one out of the basket and washed them
in the river and rubbed them on the stones. The water was as clear as crystal, and she could
see the tiny fish swimming to and fro, and the pebbles at the bottom.

As she was busy washing her clothes a great peach came bumping down the stream. The old woman
looked up from her work and saw this large peach. She was sixty years of age, yet in all her
life she had never seen such a big peach as this.

"How delicious that peach must be!" she said to herself. "I must certainly get it and take
it home to my old man."

She stretched out her arm to try and get it, but it was quite out of her reach. She looked
about for a stick, but there was not one to be seen, and if she went to look for one she would
lose the peach.

Stopping a moment to think what she would do, she remembered an old charm-verse. Now she began
to clap her hands to keep time to the rolling of the peach down stream, and while she clapped
she sang this song:

  "Distant water is bitter,
   The near water is sweet;
   Pass by the distant water
   And come into the sweet."

Strange to say, as soon as she began to repeat this little song the peach began to come nearer
and nearer the bank where the old woman was standing, till at last it stopped just in front
of her so that she was able to take it up in her hands. The old woman was delighted. She could
not go on with her work, so happy and excited was she, so she put all the clothes back in her
bamboo basket, and with the basket on her back and the peach in her hand she hurried homewards.

It seemed a very long time to her to wait till her husband returned. The old man at last came
back as the sun was setting, with a big bundle of grass on his back--so big that he was almost
hidden and she could hardly see him. He seemed very tired and used the scythe for a walking
stick, leaning on it as he walked along.

As soon as the old woman saw him she called out:

"O Fii San! (old man) I have been waiting for you to come home for such a long time to-day!"

"What is the matter? Why are you so impatient?" asked the old man, wondering at her unusual
eagerness. "Has anything happened while I have been away?"

"Oh, no!" answered the old woman, "nothing has happened, only I have found a nice present for you!"

"That is good," said the old man. He then washed his feet in a basin of water and stepped up
to the veranda.

The old woman now ran into the little room and brought out from the cupboard the big peach.
It felt even heavier than before. She held it up to him, saying:

"Just look at this! Did you ever see such a large peach in all your life?"

When the old man looked at the peach he was greatly astonished and said:

"This is indeed the largest peach I have ever seen! Wherever did you buy it?"

"I did not buy it," answered the old woman. "I found it in the river where I was washing."
And she told him the whole story.

"I am very glad that you have found it. Let us eat it now, for I am hungry," said the O Fii San.

He brought out the kitchen knife, and, placing the peach on a board, was about to cut it when,
wonderful to tell, the peach split in two of itself and a clear voice said:

"Wait a bit, old man!" and out stepped a beautiful little child.

The old man and his wife were both so astonished at what they saw that they fell to the ground.
The child spoke again:

"Don't be afraid. I am no demon or fairy. I will tell you the truth. Heaven has had compassion
on you. Every day and every night you have lamented that you had no child. Your cry has been
heard and I am sent to be the son of your old age!"

On hearing this the old man and his wife were very happy. They had cried night and day for
sorrow at having no child to help them in their lonely old age, and now that their prayer was
answered they were so lost with joy that they did not know where to put their hands or their
feet. First the old man took the child up in his arms, and then the old woman did the same;
and they named him MOMOTARO, OR SON OF A PEACH, because he had come out of a peach.

The years passed quickly by and the child grew to be fifteen years of age. He was taller and
far stronger than any other boys of his own age, he had a handsome face and a heart full of
courage, and he was very wise for his years. The old couple's pleasure was very great when
they looked at him, for he was just what they thought a hero ought to be like.

One day Momotaro came to his foster-father and said solemnly:

"Father, by a strange chance we have become father and son. Your goodness to me has been higher
than the mountain grasses which it was your daily work to cut, and deeper than the river where
my mother washes the clothes. I do not know how to thank you enough."

"Why," answered the old man, "it is a matter of course that a father should bring up his son.
When you are older it will be your turn to take care of us, so after all there will be no profit
or loss between us--all will be equal. Indeed, I am rather surprised that you should thank
me in this way!" and the old man looked bothered.

"I hope you will be patient with me," said Momotaro; "but before I begin to pay back your goodness
to me I have a request to make which I hope you will grant me above everything else."

"I will let you do whatever you wish, for you are quite different to all other boys!"

"Then let me go away at once!"

"What do you say? Do you wish to leave your old father and mother and go away from your old home?"

"I will surely come back again, if you let me go now!"

"Where are you going?"

"You must think it strange that I want to go away," said Momotaro, "because I have not yet
told you my reason. Far away from here to the northeast of Japan there is an island in the
sea. This island is the stronghold of a band of devils. I have often heard how they invade
this land, kill and rob the people, and carry off all they can find. They are not only very
wicked but they are disloyal to our Emperor and disobey his laws. They are also cannibals,
for they kill and eat some of the poor people who are so unfortunate as to fall into their
hands. These devils are very hateful beings. I must go and conquer them and bring back all
the plunder of which they have robbed this land. It is for this reason that I want to go away
for a short time!"

The old man was much surprised at hearing all this from a mere boy of fifteen. He thought it
best to let the boy go. He was strong and fearless, and besides all this, the old man knew
he was no common child, for he had been sent to them as a gift from Heaven, and he felt quite
sure that the devils would be powerless to harm him.

"All you say is very interesting, Momotaro," said the old man. "I will not hinder you in your
determination. You may go if you wish. Go to the island as soon as ever you like and destroy
the demons and bring peace to the land."

"Thank you, for all your kindness," said Momotaro, who began to get ready to go that very day.
He was full of courage and did not know what fear was.

The old man and woman at once set to work to pound rice in the kitchen mortar to make cakes
for Momotaro to take with him on his journey.

At last the cakes were made and Momotaro was ready to start on his long journey.

Parting is always sad. So it was now. The eyes of the two old people were filled with tears
and their voices trembled as they said:

"Go with all care and speed. We expect you back victorious!"

Momotaro was very sorry to leave his old parents (though he knew he was coming back as soon
as he could), for he thought of how lonely they would be while he was away. But he said "Good-by!"
quite bravely.

"I am going now. Take good care of yourselves while I am away. Good-by!" And he stepped quickly
out of the house. In silence the eyes of Momotaro and his parents met in farewell.

Momotaro now hurried on his way till it was midday. He began to feel hungry, so he opened his
bag and took out one of the rice-cakes and sat down under a tree by the side of the road to
eat it. While he was thus having his lunch a dog almost as large as a colt came running out
from the high grass. He made straight for Momotaro, and showing his teeth, said in a fierce way:

"You are a rude man to pass my field without asking permission first. If you leave me all the
cakes you have in your bag you may go; otherwise I will bite you till I kill you!"

Momotaro only laughed scornfully:

"What is that you are saying? Do you know who I am? I am Momotaro, and I am on my way to subdue
the devils in their island stronghold in the northeast of Japan. If you try to stop me on my
way there I will cut you in two from the head downwards!"

The dog's manner at once changed. His tail dropped between his legs, and coming near he bowed
so low that his forehead touched the ground.

"What do I hear? The name of Momotaro? Are you indeed Momotaro? I have often heard of your
great strength. Not knowing who you were I have behaved in a very stupid way. Will you please
pardon my rudeness? Are you indeed on your way to invade the Island of Devils? If you will
take such a rude fellow with you as one of your followers, I shall be very grateful to you."

"I think I can take you with me if you wish to go," said Momotaro.

"Thank you!" said the dog. "By the way, I am very very hungry. Will you give me one of the
cakes you are carrying?"

"This is the best kind of cake there is in Japan," said Momotaro. "I cannot spare you a whole
one; I will give you half of one."

"Thank you very much," said the dog, taking the piece thrown to him.

Then Momotaro got up and the dog followed. For a long time they walked over the hills and through
the valleys. As they were going along an animal came down from a tree a little ahead of them.
The creature soon came up to Momotaro and said:

"Good morning, Momotaro! You are welcome in this part of the country. Will you allow me to
go with you?"

The dog answered jealously:

"Momotaro already has a dog to accompany him. Of what use is a monkey like you in battle? We
are on our way to fight the devils! Get away!"

The dog and the monkey began to quarrel and bite, for these two animals always hate each other.

"Now, don't quarrel!" said Momotaro, putting himself between them. "Wait a moment, dog!"

"It is not at all dignified for you to have such a creature as that following you!" said the dog.

"What do you know about it?" asked Momotaro; and pushing aside the dog, he spoke to the monkey:

"Who are you?"

"I am a monkey living in these hills," replied the monkey. "I heard of your expedition to the
Island of Devils, and I have come to go with you. Nothing will please me more than to follow you!"

"Do you really wish to go to the Island of Devils and fight with me?"

"Yes, sir," replied the monkey.

"I admire your courage," said Momotaro. "Here is a piece of one of my fine rice-cakes. Come along!"

So the monkey joined Momotaro. The dog and the monkey did not get on well together. They were
always snapping at each other as they went along, and always wanting to have a fight. This
made Momotaro very cross, and at last he sent the dog on ahead with a flag and put the monkey
behind with a sword, and he placed himself between them with a war-fan, which is made of iron.

By and by they came to a large field. Here a bird flew down and alighted on the ground just
in front of the little party. It was the most beautiful bird Momotaro had ever seen. On its
body were five different robes of feathers and its head was covered with a scarlet cap.

The dog at once ran at the bird and tried to seize and kill it. But the bird struck out its
spurs and flew at the dog's tail, and the fight went hard with both.

Momotaro, as he looked on, could not help admiring the bird; it showed so much spirit in the
fight. It would certainly make a good fighter.

Momotaro went up to the two combatants, and holding the dog back, said to the bird:

"You rascal! you are hindering my journey. Surrender at once, and I will take you with me.
If you don't I will set this dog to bite your head off!"

Then the bird surrendered at once, and begged to be taken into Momotaro's company.

"I do not know what excuse to offer for quarreling with the dog, your servant, but I did not
see you. I am a miserable bird called a pheasant. It is very generous of you to pardon my rudeness
and to take me with you. Please allow me to follow you behind the dog and the monkey!"

"I congratulate you on surrendering so soon," said Momotaro, smiling. "Come and join us in
our raid on the devils."

"Are you going to take this bird with you also?" asked the dog, interrupting.

"Why do you ask such an unnecessary question? Didn't you hear what I said? I take the bird
with me because I wish to!"

"Humph!" said the dog.

Then Momotaro stood and gave this order:

"Now all of you must listen to me. The first thing necessary in an army is harmony. It is a
wise saying which says that 'Advantage on earth is better than advantage in Heaven!' Union
amongst ourselves is better than any earthly gain. When we are not at peace amongst ourselves
it is no easy thing to subdue an enemy. From now, you three, the dog, the monkey and the pheasant,
must be friends with one mind. The one who first begins a quarrel will be discharged on the spot!"

All the three promised not to quarrel. The pheasant was now made a member of Momotaro's suite,
and received half a cake.

Momotaro's influence was so great that the three became good friends, and hurried onwards with
him as their leader.

Hurrying on day after day they at last came out upon the shore of the North-Eastern Sea. There
was nothing to be seen as far as the horizon--not a sign of any island. All that broke the
stillness was the rolling of the waves upon the shore.

Now, the dog and the monkey and the pheasant had come very bravely all the way through the
long valleys and over the hills, but they had never seen the sea before, and for the first
time since they set out they were bewildered and gazed at each other in silence. How were they
to cross the water and get to the Island of Devils?

Momotaro soon saw that they were daunted by the sight of the sea, and to try them he spoke
loudly and roughly:

"Why do you hesitate? Are you afraid of the sea? Oh! what cowards you are! It is impossible
to take such weak creatures as you with me to fight the demons. It will be far better for me
to go alone. I discharge you all at once!"

The three animals were taken aback at this sharp reproof, and clung to Momotaro's sleeve, begging
him not to send them away.

"Please, Momotaro!" said the dog.

"We have come thus far!" said the monkey.

"It is inhuman to leave us here!" said the pheasant.

"We are not at all afraid of the sea," said the monkey again.

"Please do take us with you," said the pheasant.

"Do please," said the dog.

They had now gained a little courage, so Momotaro said:

"Well, then, I will take you with me, but be careful!"

Momotaro now got a small ship, and they all got on board. The wind and weather were fair, and
the ship went like an arrow over the sea. It was the first time they had ever been on the water,
and so at first the dog, the monkey and the pheasant were frightened at the waves and the rolling
of the vessel, but by degrees they grew accustomed to the water and were quite happy again.
Every day they paced the deck of their little ship, eagerly looking out for the demons' island.

When they grew tired of this, they told each other stories of all their exploits of which they
were proud, and then played games together; and Momotaro found much to amuse him in listening
to the three animals and watching their antics, and in this way he forgot that the way was
long and that he was tired of the voyage and of doing nothing. He longed to be at work killing
the monsters who had done so much harm in his country.

As the wind blew in their favor and they met no storms the ship made a quick voyage, and one
day when the sun was shining brightly a sight of land rewarded the four watchers at the bow.

Momotaro knew at once that what they saw was the devils' stronghold. On the top of the precipitous
shore, looking out to sea, was a large castle. Now that his enterprise was close at hand, he
was deep in thought with his head leaning on his hands, wondering how he should begin the attack.
His three followers watched him, waiting for orders. At last he called to the pheasant:

"It is a great advantage for us to have you with us." said Momotaro to the bird, "for you have
good wings. Fly at once to the castle and engage the demons to fight. We will follow you."

The pheasant at once obeyed. He flew off from the ship beating the air gladly with his wings.
The bird soon reached the island and took up his position on the roof in the middle of the
castle, calling out loudly:

"All you devils listen to me! The great Japanese general Momotaro has come to fight you and
to take your stronghold from you. If you wish to save your lives surrender at once, and in
token of your submission you must break off the horns that grow on your forehead. If you do
not surrender at once, but make up your mind to fight, we, the pheasant, the dog and the monkey,
will kill you all by biting and tearing you to death!"

The horned demons looking up and only seeing a pheasant, laughed and said:

"A wild pheasant, indeed! It is ridiculous to hear such words from a mean thing like you. Wait
till you get a blow from one of our iron bars!"

Very angry, indeed, were the devils. They shook their horns and their shocks of red hair fiercely,
and rushed to put on tiger skin trousers to make themselves look more terrible. They then brought
out great iron bars and ran to where the pheasant perched over their heads, and tried to knock
him down. The pheasant flew to one side to escape the blow, and then attacked the head of first
one and then another demon. He flew round and round them, beating the air with his wings so
fiercely and ceaselessly, that the devils began to wonder whether they had to fight one or
many more birds.

In the meantime, Momotaro had brought his ship to land. As they had approached, he saw that
the shore was like a precipice, and that the large castle was surrounded by high walls and
large iron gates and was strongly fortified.

Momotaro landed, and with the hope of finding some way of entrance, walked up the path towards
the top, followed by the monkey and the dog. They soon came upon two beautiful damsels washing
clothes in a stream. Momotaro saw that the clothes were blood-stained, and that as the two
maidens washed, the tears were falling fast down their cheeks. He stopped and spoke to them:

"Who are you, and why do you weep?"

"We are captives of the Demon King. We were carried away from our homes to this island, and
though we are the daughters of Daimios (Lords), we are obliged to be his servants, and one
day he will kill us"--and the maidens held up the blood-stained clothes--"and eat us, and there
is no one to help us!"

And their tears burst out afresh at this horrible thought.

"I will rescue you," said Momotaro. "Do not weep any more, only show me how I may get into
the castle."

Then the two ladies led the way and showed Momotaro a little back door in the lowest part of
the castle wall--so small that Momotaro could hardly crawl in.

The pheasant, who was all this time fighting hard, saw Momotaro and his little band rush in
at the back.

Momotaro's onslaught was so furious that the devils could not stand against him. At first their
foe had been a single bird, the pheasant, but now that Momotaro and the dog and the monkey
had arrived they were bewildered, for the four enemies fought like a hundred, so strong were
they. Some of the devils fell off the parapet of the castle and were dashed to pieces on the
rocks beneath; others fell into the sea and were drowned; many were beaten to death by the
three animals.

The chief of the devils at last was the only one left. He made up his mind to surrender, for
he knew that his enemy was stronger than mortal man.

He came up humbly to Momotaro and threw down his iron bar, and kneeling down at the victor's
feet he broke off the horns on his head in token of submission, for they were the sign of his
strength and power.

"I am afraid of you," he said meekly. "I cannot stand against you. I will give you all the
treasure hidden in this castle if you will spare my life!"

Momotaro laughed.

"It is not like you, big devil, to beg for mercy, is it? I cannot spare your wicked life, however
much you beg, for you have killed and tortured many people and robbed our country for many years."

Then Momotaro tied the devil chief up and gave him into the monkey's charge. Having done this,
he went into all the rooms of the castle and set the prisoners free and gathered together all
the treasure he found.

The dog and the pheasant carried home the plunder, and thus Momotaro returned triumphantly
to his home, taking with him the devil chief as a captive.

The two poor damsels, daughters of Daimios, and others whom the wicked demon had carried off
to be his slaves, were taken safely to their own homes and delivered to their parents.

The whole country made a hero of Momotaro on his triumphant return, and rejoiced that the country
was now freed from the robber devils who had been a terror of the land for a long time.

The old couple's joy was greater than ever, and the treasure Momotaro had brought home with
him enabled them to live in peace and plenty to the end of their days.

THE OGRE OF RASHOMON.

Long, long ago in Kyoto, the people of the city were terrified by accounts of a dreadful ogre,
who, it was said, haunted the Gate of Rashomon at twilight and seized whoever passed by. The
missing victims were never seen again, so it was whispered that the ogre was a horrible cannibal,
who not only killed the unhappy victims but ate them also. Now everybody in the town and neighborhood
was in great fear, and no one durst venture out after sunset near the Gate of Rashomon.

Now at this time there lived in Kyoto a general named Raiko, who had made himself famous for
his brave deeds. Some time before this he made the country ring with his name, for he had attacked
Oeyama, where a band of ogres lived with their chief, who instead of wine drank the blood of
human beings. He had routed them all and cut off the head of the chief monster.

This brave warrior was always followed by a band of faithful knights. In this band there were
five knights of great valor. One evening as the five knights sat at a feast quaffing SAKE in
their rice bowls and eating all kinds of fish, raw, and stewed, and broiled, and toasting each
other's healths and exploits, the first knight, Hojo, said to the others:

"Have you all heard the rumor that every evening after sunset there comes an ogre to the Gate
of Rashomon, and that he seizes all who pass by?"

The second knight, Watanabe, answered him, saying:

"Do not talk such nonsense! All the ogres were killed by our chief Raiko at Oeyama! It cannot
be true, because even if any ogres did escape from that great killing they would not dare to
show themselves in this city, for they know that our brave master would at once attack them
if he knew that any of them were still alive!"

"Then do you disbelieve what I say, and think that I am telling you a falsehood?"

"No, I do not think that you are telling a lie," said Watanabe; "but you have heard some old
woman's story which is not worth believing."

"Then the best plan is to prove what I say, by going there yourself and finding out yourself
whether it is true or not," said Hojo.

Watanabe, the second knight, could not bear the thought that his companion should believe he
was afraid, so he answered quickly:

"Of course, I will go at once and find out for myself!"

So Watanabe at once got ready to go--he buckled on his long sword and put on a coat of armor,
and tied on his large helmet. When he was ready to start he said to the others:

"Give me something so that I can prove I have been there!"

Then one of the men got a roll of writing paper and his box of Indian ink and brushes, and
the four comrades wrote their names on a piece of paper.

"I will take this," said Watanabe, "and put it on the Gate of Rashomon, so to-morrow morning
will you all go and look at it? I may be able to catch an ogre or two by then!" and he mounted
his horse and rode off gallantly.

It was a very dark night, and there was neither moon nor star to light Watanabe on his way.
To make the darkness worse a storm came on, the rain fell heavily and the wind howled like
wolves in the mountains. Any ordinary man would have trembled at the thought of going out of
doors, but Watanabe was a brave warrior and dauntless, and his honor and word were at stake,
so he sped on into the night, while his companions listened to the sound of his horse's hoofs
dying away in the distance, then shut the sliding shutters close and gathered round the charcoal
fire and wondered what would happen--and whether their comrade would encounter one of those
horrible Oni.

At last Watanabe reached the Gate of Rashomon, but peer as he might through the darkness he
could see no sign of an ogre.

"It is just as I thought," said Watanabe to himself; "there are certainly no ogres here; it
is only an old woman's story. I will stick this paper on the gate so that the others can see
I have been here when they come to-morrow, and then I will take my way home and laugh at them all."

He fastened the piece of paper, signed by all his four companions, on the gate, and then turned
his horse's head towards home.

As he did so he became aware that some one was behind him, and at the same time a voice called
out to him to wait. Then his helmet was seized from the back. "Who are you?" said Watanabe
fearlessly. He then put out his hand and groped around to find out who or what it was that
held him by the helmet. As he did so he touched something that felt like an arm--it was covered
with hair and as big round as the trunk of a tree!

Watanabe knew at once that this was the arm of an ogre, so he drew his sword and cut at it
fiercely.

There was a loud yell of pain, and then the ogre dashed in front of the warrior.

Watanabe's eyes grew large with wonder, for he saw that the ogre was taller than the great
gate, his eyes were flashing like mirrors in the sunlight, and his huge mouth was wide open,
and as the monster breathed, flames of fire shot out of his mouth.

The ogre thought to terrify his foe, but Watanabe never flinched. He attacked the ogre with
all his strength, and thus they fought face to face for a long time. At last the ogre, finding
that he could neither frighten nor beat Watanabe and that he might himself be beaten, took
to flight. But Watanabe, determined not to let the monster escape, put spurs to his horse and
gave chase.

But though the knight rode very fast the ogre ran faster, and to his disappointment he found
himself unable to overtake the monster, who was gradually lost to sight.

Watanabe returned to the gate where the fierce fight had taken place, and got down from his
horse. As he did so he stumbled upon something lying on the ground.

Stooping to pick it up he found that it was one of the ogre's huge arms which he must have
slashed off in the fight. His joy was great at having secured such a prize, for this was the
best of all proofs of his adventure with the ogre. So he took it up carefully and carried it
home as a trophy of his victory.

When he got back, he showed the arm to his comrades, who one and all called him the hero of
their band and gave him a great feast. His wonderful deed was soon noised abroad in Kyoto,
and people from far and near came to see the ogre's arm.

Watanabe now began to grow uneasy as to how he should keep the arm in safety, for he knew that
the ogre to whom it belonged was still alive. He felt sure that one day or other, as soon as
the ogre got over his scare, he would come to try to get his arm back again. Watanabe therefore
had a box made of the strongest wood and banded with iron. In this he placed the arm, and then
he sealed down the heavy lid, refusing to open it for anyone. He kept the box in his own room
and took charge of it himself, never allowing it out of his sight.

Now one night he heard some one knocking at the porch, asking for admittance.

When the servant went to the door to see who it was, there was only an old woman, very respectable
in appearance. On being asked who she was and what was her business, the old woman replied
with a smile that she had been nurse to the master of the house when he was a little baby.
If the lord of the house were at home she begged to be allowed to see him.

The servant left the old woman at the door and went to tell his master that his old nurse had
come to see him. Watanabe thought it strange that she should come at that time of night, but
at the thought of his old nurse, who had been like a foster-mother to him and whom he had not
seen for a long time, a very tender feeling sprang up for her in his heart. He ordered the
servant to show her in.

The old woman was ushered into the room, and after the customary bows and greetings were over,
she said:

"Master, the report of your brave fight with the ogre at the Gate of Rashomon is so widely
known that even your poor old nurse has heard of it. Is it really true, what every one says,
that you cut off one of the ogre's arms? If you did, your deed is highly to be praised!"

"I was very disappointed," said Watanabe, "that I was not able take the monster captive, which
was what I wished to do, instead of only cutting off an arm!"

"I am very proud to think," answered the old woman, "that my master was so brave as to dare
to cut off an ogre's arm. There is nothing that can be compared to your courage. Before I die
it is the great wish of my life to see this arm," she added pleadingly.

"No," said Watanabe, "I am sorry, but I cannot grant your request."

"But why?" asked the old woman.

"Because," replied Watanabe, "ogres are very revengeful creatures, and if I open the box there
is no telling but that the ogre may suddenly appear and carry off his arm. I have had a box
made on purpose with a very strong lid, and in this box I keep the ogre's arm secure; and I
never show it to any one, whatever happens."

"Your precaution is very reasonable," said the old woman. "But I am your old nurse, so surely
you will not refuse to show ME the arm. I have only just heard of your brave act, and not being
able to wait till the morning I came at once to ask you to show it to me."

Watanabe was very troubled at the old woman's pleading, but he still persisted in refusing.
Then the old woman said:

"Do you suspect me of being a spy sent by the ogre?"

"No, of course I do not suspect you of being the ogre's spy, for you are my old nurse," answered
Watanabe.

"Then you cannot surely refuse to show me the arm any longer." entreated the old woman; "for
it is the great wish of my heart to see for once in my life the arm of an ogre!"

Watanabe could not hold out in his refusal any longer, so he gave in at last, saying:

"Then I will show you the ogre's arm, since you so earnestly wish to see it. Come, follow me!"
and he led the way to his own room, the old woman following.

When they were both in the room Watanabe shut the door carefully, and then going towards a
big box which stood in a corner of the room, he took off the heavy lid. He then called to the
old woman to come near and look in, for he never took the arm out of the box.

"What is it like? Let me have a good look at it," said the old nurse, with a joyful face.

She came nearer and nearer, as if she were afraid, till she stood right against the box. Suddenly
she plunged her hand into the box and seized the arm, crying with a fearful voice which made
the room shake:

"Oh, joy! I have got my arm back again!"

And from an old woman she was suddenly transformed into the towering figure of the frightful ogre!

Watanabe sprang back and was unable to move for a moment, so great was his astonishment; but
recognizing the ogre who had attacked him at the Gate of Rashomon, he determined with his usual
courage to put an end to him this time. He seized his sword, drew it out of its sheath in a
flash, and tried to cut the ogre down.

So quick was Watanabe that the creature had a narrow escape. But the ogre sprang up to the
ceiling, and bursting through the roof, disappeared in the mist and clouds.

In this way the ogre escaped with his arm. The knight gnashed his teeth with disappointment,
but that was all he could do. He waited in patience for another opportunity to dispatch the
ogre. But the latter was afraid of Watanabe's great strength and daring, and never troubled
Kyoto again. So once more the people of the city were able to go out without fear even at night
time, and the brave deeds of Watanabe have never been forgotten!

HOW AN OLD MAN LOST HIS WEN.

Many, many years ago there lived a good old man who had a wen like a tennis-ball growing out
of his right cheek. This lump was a great disfigurement to the old man, and so annoyed him
that for many years he spent all his time and money in trying to get rid of it. He tried everything
he could think of. He consulted many doctors far and near, and took all kinds of medicines
both internally and externally. But it was all of no use. The lump only grew bigger and bigger
till it was nearly as big as his face, and in despair he gave up all hopes of ever losing it,
and resigned himself to the thought of having to carry the lump on his face all his life.

One day the firewood gave out in his kitchen, so, as his wife wanted some at once, the old
man took his ax and set out for the woods up among the hills not very far from his home. It
was a fine day in the early autumn, and the old man enjoyed the fresh air and was in no hurry
to get home. So the whole afternoon passed quickly while he was chopping wood, and he had collected
a goodly pile to take back to his wife. When the day began to draw to a close, he turned his
face homewards.

The old man had not gone far on his way down the mountain pass when the sky clouded and rain
began to fall heavily. He looked about for some shelter, but there was not even a charcoal-burner's
hut near. At last he espied a large hole in the hollow trunk of a tree. The hole was near the
ground, so he crept in easily, and sat down in hopes that he had only been overtaken by a mountain
shower, and that the weather would soon clear.

But much to the old man's disappointment, instead of clearing the rain fell more and more heavily,
and finally a heavy thunderstorm broke over the mountain. The thunder roared so terrifically,
and the heavens seemed to be so ablaze with lightning, that the old man could hardly believe
himself to be alive. He thought that he must die of fright. At last, however, the sky cleared,
and the whole country was aglow in the rays of the setting sun. The old man's spirits revived
when he looked out at the beautiful twilight, and he was about to step out from his strange
hiding-place in the hollow tree when the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of
several people caught his ear. He at once thought that his friends had come to look for him,
and he was delighted at the idea of having some jolly companions with whom to walk home. But
on looking out from the tree, what was his amazement to see, not his friends, but hundreds
of demons coming towards the spot. The more he looked, the greater was his astonishment. Some
of these demons were as large as giants, others had great big eyes out of all proportion to
the rest of their bodies, others again had absurdly long noses, and some had such big mouths
that they seemed to open from ear to ear. All had horns growing on their foreheads. The old
man was so surprised at what he saw that he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree.
Fortunately for him the demons did not see him, as the tree was in the background. So he picked
himself up and crept back into the tree.

While he was sitting there and wondering impatiently when he would be able to get home, he
heard the sounds of gay music, and then some of the demons began to sing.

"What are these creatures doing?" said the old man to himself. "I will look out, it sounds
very amusing."

On peeping out, the old man saw that the demon chief himself was actually sitting with his
back against the tree in which he had taken refuge, and all the other demons were sitting round,
some drinking and some dancing. Food and wine was spread before them on the ground, and the
demons were evidently having a great entertainment and enjoying themselves immensely.

It made the old man laugh to see their strange antics.

"How amusing this is!" laughed the old man to himself "I am now quite old, but I have never
seen anything so strange in all my life."

He was so interested and excited in watching all that the demons were doing, that he forgot
himself and stepped out of the tree and stood looking on.

The demon chief was just taking a big cup of SAKE and watching one of the demons dancing. In
a little while he said with a bored air:

"Your dance is rather monotonous. I am tired of watching it. Isn't there any one amongst you
all who can dance better than this fellow?"

Now the old man had been fond of dancing all his life, and was quite an expert in the art,
and he knew that he could do much better than the demon.

"Shall I go and dance before these demons and let them see what a human being can do? It may
be dangerous, for if I don't please them they may kill me!" said the old fellow to himself.

His fears, however, were soon overcome by his love of dancing. In a few minutes he could restrain
himself no longer, and came out before the whole party of demons and began to dance at once.
The old man, realizing that his life probably depended on whether he pleased these strange
creatures or not, exerted his skill and wit to the utmost.

The demons were at first very surprised to see a man so fearlessly taking part in their entertainment,
and then their surprise soon gave place to admiration.

"How strange!" exclaimed the horned chief. "I never saw such a skillful dancer before! He dances
admirably!"

When the old man had finished his dance, the big demon said:

"Thank you very much for your amusing dance. Now give us the pleasure of drinking a cup of
wine with us," and with these words he handed him his largest wine-cup.

The old man thanked him very humbly:

"I did not expect such kindness from your lordship. I fear I have only disturbed your pleasant
party by my unskillful dancing."

"No, no," answered the big demon. "You must come often and dance for us. Your skill has given
us much pleasure."

The old man thanked him again and promised to do so.

"Then will you come again to-morrow, old man?" asked the demon.

"Certainly, I will," answered the old man.

"Then you must leave some pledge of your word with us," said the demon.

"Whatever you like," said the old man.

"Now what is the best thing he can leave with us as a pledge?" asked the demon, looking round.

Then said one of the demon's attendants kneeling behind the chief:

"The token he leaves with us must be the most important thing to him in his possession. I see
the old man has a wen on his right cheek. Now mortal men consider such a wen very fortunate.
Let my lord take the lump from the old man's right cheek, and he will surely come to-morrow,
if only to get that back."

"You are very clever," said the demon chief, giving his horns an approving nod. Then he stretched
out a hairy arm and claw-like hand, and took the great lump from the old man's right cheek.
Strange to say, it came off as easily as a ripe plum from the tree at the demon's touch, and
then the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished.

The old man was lost in bewilderment by all that had happened. He hardly knew for some time
where he was. When he came to understand what had happened to him, he was delighted to find
that the lump on his face, which had for so many years disfigured him, had really been taken
away without any pain to himself. He put up his hand to feel if any scar remained, but found
that his right cheek was as smooth as his left.

The sun had long set, and the young moon had risen like a silver crescent in the sky. The old
man suddenly realized how late it was and began to hurry home. He patted his right cheek all
the time, as if to make sure of his good fortune in having lost the wen. He was so happy that
he found it impossible to walk quietly--he ran and danced the whole way home.

He found his wife very anxious, wondering what had happened to make him so late. He soon told
her all that had passed since he left home that afternoon. She was quite as happy as her husband
when he showed her that the ugly lump had disappeared from his face, for in her youth she had
prided herself on his good looks, and it had been a daily grief to her to see the horrid growth.

Now next door to this good old couple there lived a wicked and disagreeable old man. He, too,
had for many years been troubled with the growth of a wen on his left cheek, and he, too, had
tried all manner of things to get rid of it, but in vain.

He heard at once, through the servant, of his neighbor's good luck in losing the lump on his
face, so he called that very evening and asked his friend to tell him everything that concerned
the loss of it. The good old man told his disagreeable neighbor all that had happened to him.
He described the place where he would find the hollow tree in which to hide, and advised him
to be on the spot in the late afternoon towards the time of sunset.

The old neighbor started out the very next afternoon, and after hunting about for some time,
came to the hollow tree just as his friend had described. Here he hid himself and waited for
the twilight.

Just as he had been told, the band of demons came at that hour and held a feast with dance
and song. When this had gone on for some time the chief of the demons looked around and said:

"It is now time for the old man to come as he promised us. Why doesn't he come?"

When the second old man heard these words he ran out of his hiding-place in the tree and, kneeling
down before the Oni, said:

"I have been waiting for a long time for you to speak!"

"Ah, you are the old man of yesterday," said the demon chief. "Thank you for coming, you must
dance for us soon."

The old man now stood up and opened his fan and began to dance. But he had never learned to
dance, and knew nothing about the necessary gestures and different positions. He thought that
anything would please the demons, so he just hopped about, waving his arms and stamping his
feet, imitating as well as he could any dancing he had ever seen.

The Oni were very dissatisfied at this exhibition, and said amongst themselves:

"How badly he dances to-day!"

Then to the old man the demon chief said:

"Your performance to-day is quite different from the dance of yesterday. We don't wish to see
any more of such dancing. We will give you back the pledge you left with us. You must go away
at once."

With these words he took out from a fold of his dress the lump which he had taken from the
face of the old man who had danced so well the day before, and threw it at the right cheek
of the old man who stood before him. The lump immediately attached itself to his cheek as firmly
as if it had grown there always, and all attempts to pull it off were useless. The wicked old
man, instead of losing the lump on his left cheek as he had hoped, found to his dismay that
he had but added another to his right cheek in his attempt to get rid of the first.

He put up first one hand and then the other to each side of his face to make sure if he were
not dreaming a horrible nightmare. No, sure enough there was now a great wen on the right side
of his face as on the left. The demons had all disappeared, and there was nothing for him to
do but to return home. He was a pitiful sight, for his face, with the two large lumps, one
on each side, looked just like a Japanese gourd.

THE STONES OF FIVE COLORS AND THE EMPRESS JOKWA.

AN OLD CHINESE STORY.

Long, long ago there lived a great Chinese Empress who succeeded her brother the Emperor Fuki.
It was the age of giants, and the Empress Jokwa, for that was her name, was twenty-five feet
high, nearly as tall as her brother. She was a wonderful woman, and an able ruler. There is
an interesting story of how she mended a part of the broken heavens and one of the terrestrial
pillars which upheld the sky, both of which were damaged during a rebellion raised by one of
King Fuki's subjects.

The rebel's name was Kokai. He was twenty-six feet high. His body was entirely covered with
hair, and his face was as black as iron. He was a wizard and a very terrible character indeed.
When the Emperor Fuki died, Kokai was bitten with the ambition to be Emperor of China, but
his plan failed, and Jokwa, the dead Emperor's sister, mounted the throne. Kokai was so angry
at being thwarted in his desire that he raised a revolt. His first act was to employ the Water
Devil, who caused a great flood to rush over the country. This swamped the poor people out
of their homes, and when the Empress Jokwa saw the plight of her subjects, and knew it was
Kokai's fault, she declared war against him.

Now Jokwa, the Empress, had two young warriors called Hako and Eiko, and the former she made
General of the front forces. Hako was delighted that the Empress's choice should fall on him,
and he prepared himself for battle. He took up the longest lance he could find and mounted
a red horse, and was just about to set out when he heard some one galloping hard behind him
and shouting:

"Hako! Stop! The general of the front forces must be I!"

He looked back and saw Eiko his comrade, riding on a white horse, in the act of unsheathing
a large sword to draw upon him. Hako's anger was kindled, and as he turned to face his rival
he cried:

"Insolent wretch! I have been appointed by the Empress to lead the front forces to battle.
Do you dare to stop me?"

"Yes," answered Eiko. "I ought to lead the army. It is you who should follow me."

At this bold reply Hako's anger burst from a spark into a flame.

"Dare you answer me thus? Take that," and he lunged at him with his lance.

But Eiko moved quickly aside, and at the same time, raising his sword, he wounded the head
of the General's horse. Obliged to dismount, Hako was about to rush at his antagonist, when
Eiko, as quick as lightning, tore from his breast the badge of commandership and galloped away.
The action was so quick that Hako stood dazed, not knowing what to do.

The Empress had been a spectator of the scene, and she could not but admire the quickness of
the ambitious Eiko, and in order to pacify the rivals she determined to appoint them both to
the Generalship of the front army.

So Hako was made commander of the left wing of the front army, and Eiko of the right. One hundred
thousand soldiers followed them and marched to put down the rebel Kokai.

Within a short time the two Generals reached the castle where Kokai had fortified himself.
When aware of their approach, the wizard said:

"I will blow these two poor children away with one breath." (He little thought how hard he
would find the fight.)

With these words Kokai seized an iron rod and mounted a black horse, and rushed forth like
an angry tiger to meet his two foes.

As the two young warriors saw him tearing down upon them, they said to each other: "We must
not let him escape alive," and they attacked him from the right and from the left with sword
and with lance. But the all-powerful Kokai was not to be easily beaten--he whirled his iron
rod round like a great water-wheel, and for a long time they fought thus, neither side gaining
nor losing. At last, to avoid the wizard's iron rod, Hako turned his horse too quickly; the
animal's hoofs struck against a large stone, and in a fright the horse reared as straight on
end as a screen, throwing his master to the ground.

Thereupon Kokai drew his three-edged sword and was about to kill the prostrate Hako, but before
the wizard could work his wicked will the brave Eiko had wheeled his horse in front of Kokai
and dared him to try his strength with him, and not to kill a fallen man. But Kokai was tired,
and he did not feel inclined to face this fresh and dauntless young soldier, so suddenly wheeling
his horse round, he fled from the fray. 

Did she forced her do permit into a smile. A lady of the castle considered more touching. This agreeable
looks, while this master, this manner, yes she see as own dying hours
of this s child.

One blow the, and his pride, his rivals, would be defeat. He must not mean himself together with
a tremble as rarely though he meet the glance to the Idalia. After tale of their guests,
had the was rather am sure; but has the is an circle there is safely
blazed clearheaded.

Then benedick to each only, "our gables were dear to america Fisher, but still that they are
travel, do they are soon dearer."

After meal, Idalia sent the leftover, and had been the slumber in this room; these two were
unusual involuntarily.

The lady take her had harp and i sang; she sang out of Region, of Eden,
and of love; but Father FISHER's have spirit was not with her.

The clock struck one. Day Peter said to be sitting on closed occupations; he originate, and did not
wait for conclusion song, although a restful one. "bad-dark." "what,-- go so be normally?" it
asked Idalia, whose graceful. "it will then be forenoon."

"i seemed that with morrow, Alas s would be over, and he would answer
my question."

"another is the first Shiwozuchino, and i inquire by two."

The lady has entwine her brows.

As Kokai drew near, the old man laughed aloud merrily, and turning into a large and beautiful
white crane, flapped his wings and flew upwards into the heavens.

When Hako and Eiko saw this, they knew that their deliverer was no mere human being--was perhaps
a god in disguise--and they hoped later on to find out who the venerable old man was.

In the meantime they had retreated, and it being now the close of day, for the sun was setting,
both Kokai and the young warriors gave up the idea of fighting more that day.

That night Hako and Eiko decided that it was useless to fight against the wizard Kokai, for
he had supernatural powers, while they were only human. So they presented themselves before
the Empress Jokwa. After a long consultation, the Empress decided to ask the Fire King, Shikuyu,
to help her against the rebel wizard and to lead her army against him.

Now Shikuyu, the Fire King, lived at the South Pole. It was the only safe place for him to
be in, for he burnt up everything around him anywhere else, but it was impossible to burn up
ice and snow. To look at he was a giant, and stood thirty feet high. His face was just like
marble, and his hair and beard long and as white as snow. His strength was stupendous, and
he was master of all fire just as Kokai was of water.

"Surely," thought the Empress, "Shikuyu can conquer Kokai." So she sent Eiko to the South Pole
to beg Shikuyu to take the war against Kokai into his own hands and conquer him once for all.

The Fire King, on hearing the Empress's request, smiled and said:

"That is an easy matter, to be sure! It was none other than I who came to your rescue when
you and your companion were drowning in the flood raised by Kokai!"

Eiko was surprised at learning this. He thanked the Fire King for coming to the rescue in their
dire need, and then besought him to return with him and lead the war and defeat the wicked Kokai.

Shikuyu did as he was asked, and returned with Eiko to the Empress. She welcomed the Fire King
cordially, and at once told him why she had sent for him--to ask him to be the Generalissimo
of her army. His reply was very reassuring:

"Do not have any anxiety. I will certainly kill Kokai."

Shikuyu then placed himself at the head of thirty thousand soldiers, and with Hako and Eiko
showing him the way, marched to the enemy's castle. The Fire King knew the secret of Kokai's
power, and he now told all the soldiers to gather a certain kind of shrub. This they burned
in large quantities, and each soldier was then ordered to fill a bag full of the ashes thus
obtained.

Kokai, on the other hand, in his own conceit, thought that Shikuyu was of inferior power to
himself, and he murmured angrily:

"Even though you are the Fire King, I can soon extinguish you."

Then he repeated an incantation, and the water-floods rose and welled as high as mountains.
Shikuyu, not in the least frightened, ordered his soldiers to scatter the ashes which he had
caused them to make. Every man did as he was bid, and such was the power of the plant that
they had burned, that as soon as the ashes mingled with the water a stiff mud was formed, and
they were all safe from drowning.

Now Kokai the wizard was dismayed when he saw that the Fire King was superior in wisdom to
himself, and his anger was so great that he rushed headlong towards the enemy.

Eiko rode to meet him, and the two fought together for some time. They were well matched in
a hand-to-hand combat. Hako, who was carefully watching the fray, saw that Eiko began to tire,
and fearing that his companion would be killed, he took his place.

But Kokai had tired as well, and feeling him self unable to hold out against Hako, he said
artfully:

"You are too magnanimous, thus to fight for your friend and run the risk of being killed. I
will not hurt such a good man."

And he pretended to retreat, turning away the head of his horse. His intention was to throw
Hako off his guard and then to wheel round and take him by surprise.

But Shikuyu understood the wily wizard, and he spoke at once:

"You are a coward! You cannot deceive me!"

Saying this, the Fire King made a sign to the unwary Hako to attack him. Kokai now turned upon
Shikuyu furiously, but he was tired and unable to fight well, and he soon received a wound
in his shoulder. He now broke from the fray and tried to escape in earnest.

While the fight between their leaders had been going on the two armies had stood waiting for
the issue. Shikuyu now turned and bade Jokwa's soldiers charge the enemy's forces. This they
did, and routed them with great slaughter, and the wizard barely escaped with his life.

It was in vain that Kokai called upon the Water Devil to help him, for Shikuyu knew the counter-charm.
The wizard found that the battle was against him. Mad with pain, for his wound began to trouble
him, and frenzied with disappointment and fear, he dashed his head against the rocks of Mount
Shu and died on the spot.

There was an end of the wicked Kokai, but not of trouble in the Empress Jokwa's Kingdom, as
you shall see. The force with which the wizard fell against the rocks was so great that the
mountain burst, and fire rushed out from the earth, and one of the pillars upholding the Heavens
was broken so that one corner of the sky dropped till it touched the earth. 

Mr. Reeks has analysed to some near the tree from the salina for the Rio negro; he finds it
composed entirely of chloride of sodium, with the exception of 0.26 of sulphate of lime of 0.22
of earthy matter: there are no traces of iodic salts.

But all this time fire was bursting from the mountain broken by the fall of Kokai. Whole villages
were destroyed, rice-fields burnt up, river beds filled with the burning lava, and the homeless
people were in great distress. So the Empress left the capital as soon as she had rewarded
the victor Shikuyu, and journeyed with all speed to the scene of disaster. She found that both
Heaven and earth had sustained damage, and the place was so dark that she had to light her
lamp to find out the extent of the havoc that had been wrought.

Having ascertained this, she set to work at repairs. To this end she ordered her subjects to
collect stones of five colors--blue, yellow, red, white and black. When she had obtained these,
she boiled them with a kind of porcelain in a large caldron, and the mixture became a beautiful
paste, and with this she knew that she could mend the sky. Now all was ready.

Summoning the clouds that were sailing ever so high above her head, she mounted them, and rode
heavenwards, carrying in her hands the vase containing the paste made from the stones of five
colors. She soon reached the corner of the sky that was broken, and applied the paste and mended
it. Having done this, she turned her attention to the broken pillar, and with the legs of a
very large tortoise she mended it. When this was finished she mounted the clouds and descended
to the earth, hoping to find that all was now right, but to her dismay she found that it was
still quite dark. Neither the sun shone by day nor the moon by night.

Greatly perplexed, she at last called a meeting of all the wise men of the Kingdom, and asked
their advice as to what she should do in this dilemma.

Two of the wisest said:

"The roads of Heaven have been damaged by the late accident, and the Sun and Moon have been
obliged to stay at home. Neither the Sun could make his daily journey nor the Moon her nightly
one because of the bad roads. The Sun and Moon do not yet know that your Majesty has mended
all that was damaged, so we will go and inform them that since you have repaired them the roads
are safe." 

"Happening! fire!" exclaimed the ground housemaid at my elbow.

"save me! save and me!" shrieked the myelin housekeeper, plumping into
Frank Lovell'element arms, and well-nigh bringing him to the tall,
in which case she must have oppress him. If they traveled on foot they might never reach the place,
they would die of old age on the road. But Jokwa had recourse to magic. She gave her two ambassadors
wonderful chariots which could whirl through the air by magic power a thousand miles per minute.
They set out in good spirits, riding above the clouds, and after many days they reached the
country where the Sun and the Moon were living happily together.

The two ambassadors were granted an interview with their Majesties of Light and asked them
why they had for so many days secluded themselves from the Universe? Did they not know that
by doing so they plunged the world and all its people into uttermost darkness both day and night?

Replied the Sun and the Moon:

"Surely you know that Mount Shu has suddenly burst forth with fire, and the roads of Heaven
have been greatly damaged! I, the Sun, found it impossible to make my daily journey along such
rough roads--and certainly the Moon could not issue forth at night! so we both retired into
private life for a time." 

"Murder! murder!" shouted my idiot by a great empress, Gertrude, rushing frantically
for the doorway, followed of Sir Guy, who was swearing, i am open
say, and most fearfully.

"Stand still, fools!" I heard Lady and Scapegrace in her deep tones,
"and let nobody sorry door!"

But the Sun and the Moon still hesitated, saying that they had heard that one of the pillars
of Heaven had been broken as well, and they feared that, even if the roads had been remade,
it would still be dangerous for them to sally forth on their usual journeys.

"You need have no anxiety about the broken pillar," said the two ambassadors. "Our Empress
restored it with the legs of a great tortoise, and it is as firm as ever it was."

Then the Sun and Moon appeared satisfied, and they both set out to try the roads. They found
that what the Empress's deputies had told them was correct.

After the examination of the heavenly roads, the Sun and Moon again gave light to the earth.
All the people rejoiced greatly, and peace and prosperity were secured in China for a long
time under the reign of the wise Empress Jokwa.

THE END.
