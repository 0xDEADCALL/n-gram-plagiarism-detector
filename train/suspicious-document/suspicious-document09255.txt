He continued to look at her with dull eyes. "I ain't been sick," he said. "Leastways not very:
only one of my old turns." He spoke in a slow laboured way, as if he had difficulty in getting
his words together.

"Rheumatism?" she ventured, seeing how unwillingly he seemed to move.

"Well--somethin' like, maybe. I couldn't hardly put a name to it."

"If it WAS anything like rheumatism, my grandmother used to make a tea--" Ann Eliza began:
she had forgotten, in the warmth of the moment, that she had only come as Evelina's messenger.

At the mention of tea an expression of uncontrollable repugnance passed over Mr. Ramy's face.
"Oh, I guess I'm getting on all right. I've just got a headache to-day."

Ann Eliza's courage dropped at the note of refusal in his voice.

"I'm sorry," she said gently. "My sister and me'd have been glad to do anything we could for you."

"Thank you kindly," said Mr. Ramy wearily; then, as she turned to the door, he added with an
effort: "Maybe I'll step round to-morrow."

"We'll be real glad," Ann Eliza repeated. Her eyes were fixed on a dusty bronze clock in the
window. She was unaware of looking at it at the time, but long afterward she remembered that
it represented a Newfoundland dog with his paw on an open book.

When she reached home there was a purchaser in the shop, turning over hooks and eyes under
Evelina's absent-minded supervision. Ann Eliza passed hastily into the back room, but in an
instant she heard her sister at her side.

"Quick! I told her I was goin' to look for some smaller hooks--how is he?" Evelina gasped.

"He ain't been very well," said Ann Eliza slowly, her eyes on Evelina's eager face; "but he
says he'll be sure to be round to-morrow night."

"He will? Are you telling me the truth?"

"Why, Evelina Bunner!"

"Oh, I don't care!" cried the younger recklessly, rushing back into the shop.

Ann Eliza stood burning with the shame of Evelina's self-exposure. She was shocked that, even
to her, Evelina should lay bare the nakedness of her emotion; and she tried to turn her thoughts
from it as though its recollection made her a sharer in her sister's debasement.

The next evening, Mr. Ramy reappeared, still somewhat sallow and red-lidded, but otherwise
his usual self. Ann Eliza consulted him about the investment he had recommended, and after
it had been settled that he should attend to the matter for her he took up the illustrated
volume of Longfellow--for, as the sisters had learned, his culture soared beyond the newspapers--and
read aloud, with a fine confusion of consonants, the poem on "Maidenhood." Evelina lowered
her lids while he read. It was a very beautiful evening, and Ann Eliza thought afterward how
different life might have been with a companion who read poetry like Mr. Ramy.

VII

During the ensuing weeks Mr. Ramy, though his visits were as frequent as ever, did not seem
to regain his usual spirits. He complained frequently of headache, but rejected Ann Eliza's
tentatively proffered remedies, and seemed to shrink from any prolonged investigation of his
symptoms. July had come, with a sudden ardour of heat, and one evening, as the three sat together
by the open window in the back room, Evelina said: "I dunno what I wouldn't give, a night like
this, for a breath of real country air."

"So would I," said Mr. Ramy, knocking the ashes from his pipe. "I'd like to be setting in an
arbour dis very minute."

"Oh, wouldn't it be lovely?"

"I always think it's real cool here--we'd be heaps hotter up where Miss Mellins is," said Ann
Eliza.

"Oh, I daresay--but we'd be heaps cooler somewhere else," her sister snapped: she was not infrequently
exasperated by Ann Eliza's furtive attempts to mollify Providence.

 After another ceremonial pause,
broken by polite enquiries and shy ejaculations, they were shown into the kitchen, where the
table was already spread with strange-looking spice-cakes and stewed fruits, and where they
presently found themselves seated between Mrs. Hochmuller and Mr. Ramy, while the staring Linda
bumped back and forth from the stove with steaming dishes.

To Ann Eliza the dinner seemed endless, and the rich fare strangely unappetizing. She was abashed
by the easy intimacy of her hostess's voice and eye. With Mr. Ramy Mrs. Hochmuller was almost
flippantly familiar, and it was only when Ann Eliza pictured her generous form bent above his
sick-bed that she could forgive her for tersely addressing him as "Ramy." During one of the
pauses of the meal Mrs. Hochmuller laid her knife and fork against the edges of her plate,
and, fixing her eyes on the clock-maker's face, said accusingly: "You hat one of dem turns
again, Ramy."

"I dunno as I had," he returned evasively.

Evelina glanced from one to the other. "Mr. Ramy HAS been sick," she said at length, as though
to show that she also was in a position to speak with authority. "He's complained very frequently
of headaches."

"Ho!--I know him," said Mrs. Hochmuller with a laugh, her eyes still on the clock-maker. "Ain't
you ashamed of yourself, Ramy?"

Mr. Ramy, who was looking at his plate, said suddenly one word which the sisters could not
understand; it sounded to Ann Eliza like "Shwike."

Mrs. Hochmuller laughed again. "My, my," she said, "wouldn't you think he'd be ashamed to go
and be sick and never dell me, me that nursed him troo dat awful fever?"

"Yes, I SHOULD," said Evelina, with a spirited glance at Ramy; but he was looking at the sausages
that Linda had just put on the table.

When dinner was over Mrs. Hochmuller invited her guests to step out of the kitchen-door, and
they found themselves in a green enclosure, half garden, half orchard. Grey hens followed by
golden broods clucked under the twisted apple-boughs, a cat dozed on the edge of an old well,
and from tree to tree ran the network of clothes-line that denoted Mrs. Hochmuller's calling.
Beyond the apple trees stood a yellow summer-house festooned with scarlet runners; and below
it, on the farther side of a rough fence, the land dipped down, holding a bit of woodland in
its hollow. It was all strangely sweet and still on that hot Sunday afternoon, and as she moved
across the grass under the apple-boughs Ann Eliza thought of quiet afternoons in church, and
of the hymns her mother had sung to her when she was a baby.

Evelina was more restless. She wandered from the well to the summer-house and back, she tossed
crumbs to the chickens and disturbed the cat with arch caresses; and at last she expressed
a desire to go down into the wood.

"I guess you got to go round by the road, then," said Mrs. Hochmuller. "My Linda she goes troo
a hole in de fence, but I guess you'd tear your dress if you was to dry."

"I'll help you," said Mr. Ramy; and guided by Linda the pair walked along the fence till they
reached a narrow gap in its boards. Through this they disappeared, watched curiously in their
descent by the grinning Linda, while Mrs. Hochmuller and Ann Eliza were left alone in the summer-house.

Mrs. Hochmuller looked at her guest with a confidential smile. "I guess dey'll be gone quite
a while," she remarked, jerking her double chin toward the gap in the fence. "Folks like dat

 He had never before called at that hour, and she wondered a little anxiously
what had brought him.

"Has anything happened?" she asked, pushing aside the basketful of buttons she had been sorting.

"Not's I know of," said Mr. Ramy tranquilly. "But I always close up the store at two o'clock
Saturdays at this season, so I thought I might as well call round and see you."

"I'm real glad, I'm sure," said Ann Eliza; "but Evelina's out."

"I know dat," Mr. Ramy answered. "I met her round de corner. She told me she got to go to dat
new dyer's up in Forty-eighth Street. She won't be back for a couple of hours, har'ly, will she?"

Ann Eliza looked at him with rising bewilderment. "No, I guess not," she answered; her instinctive
hospitality prompting her to add: "Won't you set down jest the same?"

Mr. Ramy sat down on the stool beside the counter, and Ann Eliza returned to her place behind it.

"I can't leave the store," she explained.

"Well, I guess we're very well here." Ann Eliza had become suddenly aware that Mr. Ramy was
looking at her with unusual intentness. Involuntarily her hand strayed to the thin streaks
of hair on her temples, and thence descended to straighten the brooch beneath her collar.

"You're looking very well to-day, Miss Bunner," said Mr. Ramy, following her gesture with a smile.

"Oh," said Ann Eliza nervously. "I'm always well in health," she added.

"I guess you're healthier than your sister, even if you are less sizeable."

"Oh, I don't know. Evelina's a mite nervous sometimes, but she ain't a bit sickly."

"She eats heartier than you do; but that don't mean nothing," said Mr. Ramy.

Ann Eliza was silent. She could not follow the trend of his thought, and she did not care to
commit herself farther about Evelina before she had ascertained if Mr. Ramy considered nervousness
interesting or the reverse.

But Mr. Ramy spared her all farther indecision.

"Well, Miss Bunner," he said, drawing his stool closer to the counter, "I guess I might as
well tell you fust as last what I come here for to-day. I want to get married."

Ann Eliza, in many a prayerful midnight hour, had sought to strengthen herself for the hearing
of this avowal, but now that it had come she felt pitifully frightened and unprepared. Mr.
Ramy was leaning with both elbows on the counter, and she noticed that his nails were clean
and that he had brushed his hat; yet even these signs had not prepared her!

At last she heard herself say, with a dry throat in which her heart was hammering: "Mercy me,
Mr. Ramy!"

"I want to get married," he repeated. "I'm too lonesome. It ain't good for a man to live all
alone, and eat noding but cold meat every day."

"No," said Ann Eliza softly.

"And the dust fairly beats me."

"Oh, the dust--I know!"

Mr. Ramy stretched one of his blunt-fingered hands toward her. "I wisht you'd take me."

Still Ann Eliza did not understand. She rose hesitatingly from her seat, pushing aside the
basket of buttons which lay between them; then she perceived that Mr. Ramy was trying to take
her hand, and as their fingers met a flood of joy swept over her. Never afterward, though every
other word of their interview was stamped on her memory beyond all possible forgetting, could
she recall what he said while their hands touched; she only knew that she seemed to be floating
on a summer sea, and that all its waves were in her ears.

"Me--me?" she gasped.

"I guess so," said her suitor placidly. "You suit me right down to the ground, Miss Bunner.
Dat's the truth."

A woman passing along the street paused to look at the shop-window, and Ann Eliza half hoped
she would come in; but after a desultory inspection she went on.

"Maybe you don't fancy me?" Mr. Ramy suggested, discountenanced by Ann Eliza's silence.

A word of assent was on her tongue, but her lips refused it. She must find some other way of
telling him.

"I don't say that."

"Well, I always kinder thought we was suited to one another," Mr. Ramy continued, eased of
his momentary doubt. "I always liked de quiet style--no fuss and airs, and not afraid of work."
He spoke as though dispassionately cataloguing her charms.

Ann Eliza felt that she must make an end. "But, Mr. Ramy, you don't understand. I've never
thought of marrying."

Mr. Ramy looked at her in surprise. "Why not?"

"Well, I don't know, har'ly." She moistened her twitching lips. "The fact is, I ain't as active
as I look. Maybe I couldn't stand the care. I ain't as spry as Evelina--nor as young," she
added, with a last great effort.

"But you do most of de work here, anyways," said her suitor doubtfully.

"Oh, well, that's because Evelina's busy outside; and where there's only two women the work
don't amount to much. Besides, I'm the oldest; I have to look after things," she hastened on,
half pained that her simple ruse should so readily deceive him.

"Well, I guess you're active enough for me," he persisted. His calm determination began to
frighten her; she trembled lest her own should be less staunch.

"No, no," she repeated, feeling the tears on her lashes. "I couldn't, Mr. Ramy, I couldn't
marry. I'm so surprised. I always thought it was Evelina--always. And so did everybody else.
She's so bright and pretty--it seemed so natural."

"Well, you was all mistaken," said Mr. Ramy obstinately.

"I'm so sorry."

He rose, pushing back his chair.

"You'd better think it over," he said, in the large tone of a man who feels he may safely wait.

"Oh, no, no. It ain't any sorter use, Mr. Ramy. I don't never mean to marry. I get tired so
easily--I'd be afraid of the work. And I have such awful headaches." She paused, racking her
brain for more convincing infirmities. 

Dat day, being a day were winged of the natiuitie, i come with the being,
and she kissed his fist, who sate never about a jointure, hauing over
his heade a crowne most richly be precious, and that dat ann of gold
in his hand, all apparelled on golde, and garnishee with decked stones.
There sate not distant from him in two yardes his lonesome, and next
vnto that she say a twelue into eld, who was inheritor to the Emperor
of Ann, suppress by this Fence-- yeares to.


She thought his tone had grown more resigned since she had spoken of her headaches.

For some moments he stood looking at her with a hesitating eye, as though uncertain how to
end their conversation; and at length she found courage to say (in the words of a novel she
had once read): "I don't want this should make any difference between us."

"Oh, my, no," said Mr. Ramy, absently picking up his hat.

"You'll come in just the same?" she continued, nerving herself to the effort. "We'd miss you
awfully if you didn't. Evelina, she--" She paused, torn between her desire to turn his thoughts
to Evelina, and the dread of prematurely disclosing her sister's secret.

"Don't Miss Evelina have no headaches?" Mr. Ramy suddenly asked.

"My, no, never--well, not to speak of, anyway. She ain't had one for ages, and when Evelina
IS sick she won't never give in to it," Ann Eliza declared, making some hurried adjustments
with her conscience.

"I wouldn't have thought that," said Mr. Ramy.

"I guess you don't know us as well as you thought you did."

"Well, no, that's so; maybe I don't. I'll wish you good day, Miss Bunner"; and Mr. Ramy moved
toward the door.

"Good day, Mr. Ramy," Ann Eliza answered.

She felt unutterably thankful to be alone. She knew the crucial moment of her life had passed,
and she was glad that she had not fallen below her own ideals. It had been a wonderful experience;
and in spite of the tears on her cheeks she was not sorry to have known it. Two facts, however,
took the edge from its perfection: that it had happened in the shop, and that she had not had
on her black silk.

She passed the next hour in a state of dreamy ecstasy. [sidenote: a s of Evelina.] and therefrom

All this idiom along they do from the Dwina, soprano and ashe of Change of weeks.
 She felt as though a visible
glory lay on her, and she was glad that dusk had fallen when Evelina entered. But her fears
were superfluous. Evelina, always self-absorbed, had of late lost all interest in the simple
happenings of the shop, and Ann Eliza, with mingled mortification and relief, perceived that
she was in no danger of being cross-questioned as to the events of the afternoon. She was glad
of this; yet there was a touch of humiliation in finding that the portentous secret in her
bosom did not visibly shine forth. It struck her as dull, and even slightly absurd, of Evelina
not to know at last that they were equals.

PART II

VIII

Mr. Ramy, after a decent interval, returned to the shop; and Ann Eliza, when they met, was
unable to detect whether the emotions which seethed under her black alpaca found an echo in
his bosom. Outwardly he made no sign. He lit his pipe as placidly as ever and seemed to relapse
without effort into the unruffled intimacy of old. Yet to Ann Eliza's initiated eye a change
became gradually perceptible. She saw that he was beginning to look at her sister as he had
looked at her on that momentous afternoon: she even discerned a secret significance in the
turn of his talk with Evelina. I have wed to much dear bairn. You should have the clever children as
the with you as lamentable; i am great it would be yesterday bad and young for you and them. Child
ought to have certain hesitance in their genitor, in command for them
to have any ability over them.

Really Vicky was ten period dear. It appear a Landmass. If she populate,
in eight hours less she may be write!

She is a actual deplorable child, and i must say therefore much break.

The
commonwealth of the nightmare is useless; the trait of Prussia and
the give property of Austria are very.

"I guess I won't go, thank you kindly; but I'm sure my sister will be happy to."

She was pained by the perfunctory phrase with which Evelina urged her to accompany them; and
still more by Mr. Ramy's silence.

"No, I guess I won't go," she repeated, rather in answer to herself than to them. "It's dreadfully
hot and I've got a kinder headache."

"Oh, well, I wouldn't then," said her sister hurriedly. "You'd better jest set here quietly
and rest."

*** A summary of Part I of "Bunner Sisters" appears on page 4 of the advertising pages.

"Yes, I'll rest," Ann Eliza assented.
