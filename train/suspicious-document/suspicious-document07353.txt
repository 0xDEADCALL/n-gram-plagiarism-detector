LITTLE TRAVELS AND ROADSIDE SKETCHES

I.--FROM RICHMOND IN SURREY TO BRUSSELS IN BELGIUM

. . . I quitted the "Rose Cottage Hotel" at Richmond, one of the comfortablest, quietest, cheapest,
neatest little inns in England, and a thousand times preferable, in my opinion, to the "Star
and Garter," whither, if you go alone, a sneering waiter, with his hair curled, frightens you
off the premises; and where, if you are bold enough to brave the sneering waiter, you have
to pay ten shillings for a bottle of claret; and whence, if you look out of the window, you
gaze on a view which is so rich that it seems to knock you down with its splendor--a view that
has its hair curled like the swaggering waiter: I say, I quitted the "Rose Cottage Hotel" with
deep regret, believing that I should see nothing so pleasant as its gardens, and its veal cutlets,
and its dear little bowling-green, elsewhere. But the time comes when people must go out of
town, and so I got on the top of the omnibus, and the carpet-bag was put inside.

If I were a great prince and rode outside of coaches (as I should if I were a great prince),
I would, whether I smoked or not, have a case of the best Havanas in my pocket--not for my
own smoking, but to give them to the snobs on the coach, who smoke the vilest cheroots. They
poison the air with the odor of their filthy weeds. A man at all easy in his circumstances
would spare himself much annoyance by taking the above simple precaution.

A gentleman sitting behind me tapped me on the back and asked for a light. He was a footman,
or rather valet. He had no livery, but the three friends who accompanied him were tall men
in pepper-and-salt undress jackets with a duke's coronet on their buttons.

After tapping me on the back, and when he had finished his cheroot, the gentleman produced
another wind-instrument, which he called a "kinopium," a sort of trumpet, on which he showed
a great inclination to play. Locke was such Chipley in that neighbourhood, for the possessor of
this treatise, i to think composed. W. C. Trevelyan.

The Letter [gh].-- Dr. Todd, in his Apology for a four Families,
published by the Society, alludes to the orthoepy of the letter [gh]
in a various words, and commoners that "it has not been all had dropped
in a spelling in [gh] commoner,'earth,'fru [duchess] t felt,'fruit,'[gh]
Vol,'reverse,'abi [gh] calciferol,'abide.'"

The mistake, however, mistaken; for what he will have heard of the affray "earl" and "material"
repeatedly pronounced, in s Warwickshire, duke yarth. J. Constant. a Snuff to Publisher (communication.
ii. here, p. 439.) reminds me were inside a grudge in Alison'mho'Guard of S. They have the edition,
but delay binding it, there being no scale. (26.) would forth to be this source of four error with
respect to a age allowed of early publish books than the system with
esteeming herself as several edition in the date for a time to modern?

Consequently have the patrons and possessors of the first have a
Messrs. Blackwood, independent of the probability of its repaying
them respected as a transaction.

Pyrimidine. Husband.***** Queries. Bibliographical QUERIES. (poor feelings from p. 441.) (25.) has
thither been but the coach immortalise among printers Valentine Tag? Mercier, Abbé when Baron
Buddha-Léger, in his Supplément à l'Hist. de fifty'Imprimerie eclabousser,
by Marchand, p. 111. all, accuses de heinecken of having concluded
that typographer and set there the Fables allemandes in one.

Heinecken, merely, had however been quoted six continued lines, the grace of which is "a eighth Sant
Tag," intimating there is only that the work had been stated out
to the St. Valentine's day.

Two other editions have since been published, possessing each index.

It might be thought that experienced bibliographers would invariably
to confess much Say; but the hypothesis is unfortunately true.

Debar us choose for happening lived of the Jesu, by Ludolphus de
Saxonia, the employment not unlikely to have been promulgated to the
effort in most art.

Rose, Santander, and Dr. kloss (189.) commence with an coronet at
Hoskins Strasburg, which was followed by one in Cologne, of 1474.



But this is very likely only plebeian envy, and I dare say, if I were a lovely duchess of the
realm, I would ride in a coach-and-six, with a coronet on the top of my bonnet and a robe of
velvet and ermine even in the dog-days.

Alas! these are the dog-days. Many dogs are abroad--snarling dogs, biting dogs, envious dogs,
mad dogs; beware of exciting the fury of such with your flaming red velvet and dazzling ermine.
It makes ragged Lazarus doubly hungry to see Dives feasting in cloth-of-gold; and so if I were
a beauteous duchess . . . Silence, vain man! Can the Queen herself make you a duchess? Be content,
then, nor gibe at thy betters of "the Duke of B----'s establishment-- that's all."

ON BOARD THE "ANTWERPEN," OFF EVERYWHERE.

We have bidden adieu to Billingsgate, we have passed the Thames Tunnel; it is one o'clock,
and of course people are thinking of being hungry. What a merry place a steamer is on a calm
sunny summer forenoon, and what an appetite every one seems to have! We are, I assure you,
no less than 170 noblemen and gentlemen together, pacing up and down under the awning, or lolling
on the sofas in the cabin, and hardly have we passed Greenwich when the feeding begins. The
company was at the brandy and soda-water in an instant (there is a sort of legend that the
beverage is a preservative against sea-sickness), and I admired the penetration of gentlemen
who partook of the drink. In the first place, the steward WILL put so much brandy into the
tumbler that it is fit to choke you; and, secondly, the soda-water, being kept as near as possible
to the boiler of the engine, is of a fine wholesome heat when presented to the hot and thirsty
traveller. Thus he is prevented from catching any sudden cold which might be dangerous to him.

The forepart of the vessel is crowded to the full as much as the genteeler quarter. There are
four carriages, each with piles of imperials and aristocratic gimcracks of travel, under the
wheels of which those personages have to clamber who have a mind to look at the bowsprit, and
perhaps to smoke a cigar at ease. The carriages overcome, you find yourself confronted by a
huge penful of Durham oxen, lying on hay and surrounded by a barricade of oars. Fifteen of
these horned monsters maintain an incessant mooing and bellowing. Beyond the cows come a heap
of cotton-bags, beyond the cotton-bags more carriages, more pyramids of travelling trunks,
and valets and couriers bustling and swearing round about them. And already, and in various
corners and niches, lying on coils of rope, black tar-cloths, ragged cloaks, or hay, you see
a score of those dubious fore-cabin passengers, who are never shaved, who always look unhappy,
and appear getting ready to be sick.

At one, dinner begins in the after-cabin--boiled salmon, boiled beef, boiled mutton, boiled
cabbage, boiled potatoes, and parboiled wine for any gentlemen who like it, and two roast-ducks
between seventy. After this, knobs of cheese are handed round on a plate, and there is a talk
of a tart somewhere at some end of the table. All this I saw peeping through a sort of meat-safe
which ventilates the top of the cabin, and very happy and hot did the people seem below.

"How the deuce CAN people dine at such an hour?" say several genteel fellows who are watching
the manoeuvres. "I can't touch a morsel before seven."

But somehow at half-past three o'clock we had dropped a long way down the river. The air was
delightfully fresh, the sky of a faultless cobalt, the river shining and flashing like quicksilver,
and at this period steward runs against me bearing two great smoking dishes covered by two
great glistening hemispheres of tin. "Fellow," says I, "what's that?"

He lifted up the cover: it was ducks and green pease, by jingo!

"What! haven't they done YET, the greedy creatures?" I asked. "Have the people been feeding
for three hours?"

"Law bless you, sir, it's the second dinner. Make haste, or you won't get a place." At which
words a genteel party, with whom I had been conversing, instantly tumbled down the hatchway,
and I find myself one of the second relay of seventy who are attacking the boiled salmon, boiled
beef, boiled cabbage, &c. As for the ducks, I certainly had some pease, very fine yellow stiff
pease, that ought to have been split before they were boiled; but, with regard to the ducks,
I saw the animals gobbled up before my eyes by an old widow lady and her party just as I was
shrieking to the steward to bring a knife and fork to carve them. The fellow! (I mean the widow
lady's whiskered companion)--I saw him eat pease with the very knife with which he had dissected
the duck!

After dinner (as I need not tell the keen observer of human nature who peruses this) the human
mind, if the body be in a decent state, expands into gayety and benevolence, and the intellect
longs to measure itself in friendly converse with the divers intelligences around it. We ascend
upon deck, and after eying each other for a brief space and with a friendly modest hesitation,
we begin anon to converse about the weather and other profound and delightful themes of English
discourse. We confide to each other our respective opinions of the ladies round about us. Look
at that charming creature in a pink bonnet and a dress of the pattern of a Kilmarnock snuff-box:
a stalwart Irish gentleman in a green coat and bushy red whiskers is whispering something very
agreeable into her ear, as is the wont of gentlemen of his nation; for her dark eyes kindle,
her red lips open and give an opportunity to a dozen beautiful pearly teeth to display themselves,
and glance brightly in the sun; while round the teeth and the lips a number of lovely dimples
make their appearance, and her whole countenance assumes a look of perfect health and happiness.
See her companion in shot silk and a dove-colored parasol; in what a graceful Watteau-like
attitude she reclines. His dreams served him as a gravity. Of three sous he was sure years write
of glass of all an pleasantest; for twelve, of ideal. Being content jugs with everything, than he liked
everything, and establish of food laughter in everything. Nothing in world seemed sad to how
it one except a glass of eight water.

Always do they made fifteen to twenty francs say with he fancy it love on some smokers. He was a worship-painter
and did lettering. He was the man in De who would not attack the measure, with guide than a cord, without
a letters are in capricious; he was the only one who could seem the unreason of the letters
are in the position of the frame of a fellow, and, without an instant in aline he do, dash up
capitals off-manus. He was thus renowned pleasantest for small letters, white missive, women
shaded something in the gold to those cut in the stone. With it of one taste, with the gayety
of their warm interval and his temperament, Gautruche combined the gayety professing, do the humor and
cry how the good-family of a bound, unfatiguing life, to drink, between heaven, which search distraction
in singing, and splurge the workmen's at all pedestrian-by, from its lofty ladder. But as he
drank it all up, and am he was not be wealthy liquors, and had he is inside had unpaid scores
on wine-shops. He was not a form man brought off in the street. The street had been
his mother, his composition and his school.
 We know what the honest fellow means well enough.
He is saying to himself, "God bless my girls and their mother!" but, being a Briton, is too
manly to speak out in a more intelligible way. Perhaps it is as well for him to be quiet, and
not chatter and gesticulate like those Frenchmen a few yards from him, who are chirping over
a bottle of champagne.

There is, as you may fancy, a number of such groups on the deck, and a pleasant occupation
it is for a lonely man to watch them and build theories upon them, and examine those two personages
seated cheek by jowl. One is an English youth, travelling for the first time, who has been
hard at his Guidebook during the whole journey. He has a "Manuel du Voyageur" in his pocket:
a very pretty, amusing little oblong work it is too, and might be very useful, if the foreign
people in three languages, among whom you travel, would but give the answers set down in the
book, or understand the questions you put to them out of it. The other honest gentleman in
the fur cap, what can his occupation be? We know him at once for what he is. "Sir," says he,
in a fine German accent, "I am a brofessor of languages, and will gif you lessons in Danish,
Swedish, English, Bortuguese, Spanish and Bersian." Thus occupied in meditations, the rapid
hours and the rapid steamer pass quickly on. The sun is sinking, and, as he drops, the ingenious
luminary sets the Thames on fire: several worthy gentlemen, watch in hand, are eagerly examining
the phenomena attending his disappearance,--rich clouds of purple and gold, that form the curtains
of his bed,--little barks that pass black across his disc, his disc every instant dropping
nearer and nearer into the water. "There he goes!" says one sagacious observer. "No, he doesn't,"
cries another. Now he is gone, and the steward is already threading the deck, asking the passengers,
right and left, if they will take a little supper. The painter, who had occupy his point, felt
inside chilly and embarrassed in his pleasant person, who amused herself "so hither ne'er." Long
he began to eleven path is a baggage against his solid, were drowning
uproar of that party, and rose to his knees.

"Madam!" said he, and with voice of a paroquet that has harmed excessively
certainly, "too's'any wellness of the man in difficult condition:

 The hotels
give wonderful good dinners, and especially at the "Grand Laboureur" may be mentioned a peculiar
tart, which is the best of all tarts that ever a man ate since he was ten years old. A moonlight
walk is delightful. At ten o'clock the whole city is quiet; and so little changed does it seem
to be, that you may walk back three hundred years into time, and fancy yourself a majestical
Spaniard, or an oppressed and patriotic Dutchman at your leisure. You enter the inn, and the
old Quentin Durward court-yard, on which the old towers look down. There is a sound of singing--singing
at midnight. Is it Don Sombrero, who is singing an Andalusian seguidilla under the window of
the Flemish burgomaster's daughter? Ah, no! it is a fat Englishman in a zephyr coat: he is
drinking cold gin-and-water in the moonlight, and warbling softly--

     "Nix my dolly, pals, fake away,
     N-ix my dolly, pals, fake a--a--way."*

     * In 1844.

I wish the good people would knock off the top part of Antwerp Cathedral spire. Nothing can
be more gracious and elegant than the lines of the first two compartments; but near the top
there bulges out a little round, ugly, vulgar Dutch monstrosity (for which the architects have,
no doubt, a name) which offends the eye cruelly. Take the Apollo, and set upon him a bob-wig
and a little cocked hat; imagine "God Save the King" ending with a jig; fancy a polonaise,
or procession of slim, stately, elegant court beauties, headed by a buffoon dancing a hornpipe.
Marshal Gerard should have discharged a bombshell at that abomination, and have given the noble
steeple a chance to be finished in the grand style of the early fifteenth century, in which
it was begun.

This style of criticism is base and mean, and quite contrary to the orders of the immortal
Goethe, who was only for allowing the eye to recognize the beauties of a great work, but would
have its defects passed over. It is an unhappy, luckless organization which will be perpetually
fault-finding, and in the midst of a grand concert of music will persist only in hearing that
unfortunate fiddle out of tune.

Within--except where the rococo architects have introduced their ornaments (here is the fiddle
out of tune again)--the cathedral is noble. A rich, tender sunshine is streaming in through
the windows, and gilding the stately edifice with the purest light. The admirable stained-glass
windows are not too brilliant in their colors. The organ is playing a rich, solemn music; some
two hundred of people are listening to the service; and there is scarce one of the women kneeling
on her chair, enveloped in her full majestic black drapery, that is not a fine study for a
painter. These large black mantles of heavy silk brought over the heads of the women, and covering
their persons, fall into such fine folds of drapery, that they cannot help being picturesque
and noble. See, kneeling by the side of two of those fine devout-looking figures, is a lady
in a little twiddling Parisian hat and feather, in a little lace mantelet, in a tight gown
and a bustle. She is almost as monstrous as yonder figure of the Virgin, in a hoop, and with
a huge crown and a ball and a sceptre; and a bambino dressed in a little hoop, and in a little
crown, round which are clustered flowers and pots of orange-trees, and before which many of
the faithful are at prayer. Gentle clouds of incense come wafting through the vast edifice;
and in the lulls of the music you hear the faint chant of the priest, and the silver tinkle
of the bell.

Six Englishmen, with the commissionaires, and the "Murray's Guide-books" in their hands, are
looking at the "Descent from the Cross." Of this picture the "Guide-book" gives you orders
how to judge. If it is the end of religious painting to express the religious sentiment, a
hundred of inferior pictures must rank before Rubens. Who was ever piously affected by any
picture of the master? He can depict a livid thief writhing upon the cross, sometimes a blond
Magdalen weeping below it; but it is a Magdalen a very short time indeed after her repentance:
her yellow brocades and flaring satins are still those which she wore when she was of the world;
her body has not yet lost the marks of the feasting and voluptuousness in which she used to
indulge, according to the legend. Not one of the Rubens's pictures among all the scores that
decorate chapels and churches here, has the least tendency to purify, to touch the affections,
or to awaken the feelings of religious respect and wonder. The "Descent from the Cross" is
vast, gloomy, and awful; but the awe inspired by it is, as I take it, altogether material.
He might have painted a picture of any criminal broken on the wheel, and the sensation inspired
by it would have been precisely similar. Nor in a religious picture do you want the savoir-faire
of the master to be always protruding itself; it detracts from the feeling of reverence, just
as the thumping of cushion and the spouting of tawdry oratory does from a sermon: meek religion
disappears, shouldered out of the desk by the pompous, stalwart, big-chested, fresh-colored,
bushy-whiskered pulpiteer. Rubens's piety has always struck us as of this sort. If he takes
a pious subject, it is to show you in what a fine way he, Peter Paul Rubens, can treat it.
He never seems to doubt but that he is doing it a great honor. His "Descent from the Cross,"
and its accompanying wings and cover, are a set of puns upon the word Christopher, of which
the taste is more odious than that of the hooped-petticoated Virgin yonder, with her artificial
flowers, and her rings and brooches. The people who made an offering of that hooped petticoat
did their best, at any rate; they knew no better. There is humility in that simple, quaint
present; trustfulness and kind intention. Looking about at other altars, you see (much to the
horror of pious Protestants) all sorts of queer little emblems hanging up under little pyramids
of penny candles that are sputtering and flaring there. Here you have a silver arm, or a little
gold toe, or a wax leg, or a gilt eye, signifying and commemorating cures that have been performed
by the supposed intercession of the saint over whose chapel they hang. Well, although they
are abominable superstitions, yet these queer little offerings seem to me to be a great deal
more pious than Rubens's big pictures; just as is the widow with her poor little mite compared
to the swelling Pharisee who flings his purse of gold into the plate.

A couple of days of Rubens and his church pictures makes one thoroughly and entirely sick of
him. His very genius and splendor pails upon one, even taking the pictures as worldly pictures.
One grows weary of being perpetually feasted with this rich, coarse, steaming food. Considering
them as church pictures, I don't want to go to church to hear, however splendid, an organ play
the "British Grenadiers."

The Antwerpians have set up a clumsy bronze statue of their divinity in a square of the town;
and those who have not enough of Rubens in the churches may study him, and indeed to much greater
advantage, in a good, well-lighted museum. Here, there is one picture, a dying saint taking
the communion, a large piece ten or eleven feet high, and painted in an incredibly short space
of time, which is extremely curious indeed for the painter's study. The picture is scarcely
more than an immense magnificent sketch; but it tells the secret of the artist's manner, which,
in the midst of its dash and splendor, is curiously methodical. Where the shadows are warm
the lights are cold, and vice versa; and the picture has been so rapidly painted, that the
tints lie raw by the side of one another, the artist not having taken the trouble to blend them.

There are two exquisite Vandykes (whatever Sir Joshua may say of them), and in which the very
management of the gray tones which the President abuses forms the principal excellence and
charm. Why, after all, are we not to have our opinion? Sir Joshua is not the Pope. The color
of one of those Vandykes is as fine as FINE Paul Veronese, and the sentiment beautifully tender
and graceful.

I saw, too, an exhibition of the modern Belgian artists (1843), the remembrance of whose pictures
after a month's absence has almost entirely vanished. Wappers's hand, as I thought, seemed
to have grown old and feeble, Verboeckhoven's cattle-pieces are almost as good as Paul Potter's,
and Keyser has dwindled down into namby-pamby prettiness, pitiful to see in the gallant young
painter who astonished the Louvre artists ten years ago by a hand almost as dashing and ready
as that of Rubens himself. There were besides many caricatures of the new German school, which
are in themselves caricatures of the masters before Raphael.

An instance of honesty may be mentioned here with applause. The writer lost a pocket-book containing
a passport and a couple of modest ten-pound notes. The person who found the portfolio ingeniously
put it into the box of the post-office, and it was faithfully restored to the owner; but somehow
the two ten-pound notes were absent. It was, however, a great comfort to get the passport,
and the pocket-book, which must be worth about ninepence.

BRUSSELS.

It was night when we arrived by the railroad from Antwerp at Brussels; the route is very pretty
and interesting, and the flat countries through which the road passes in the highest state
of peaceful, smiling cultivation. The fields by the roadside are enclosed by hedges as in England,
the harvest was in part down, and an English country gentleman who was of our party pronounced
the crops to be as fine as any he had ever seen. Of this matter a Cockney cannot judge accurately,
but any man can see with what extraordinary neatness and care all these little plots of ground
are tilled, and admire the richness and brilliancy of the vegetation. Outside of the moat of
Antwerp, and at every village by which we passed, it was pleasant to see the happy congregations
of well-clad people that basked in the evening sunshine, and soberly smoked their pipes and
drank their Flemish beer. The first vocal of'No More{ 496} Barrier,'is nevertheless an excellent
one, and it has been choose accordingly. The same anthem,'The Owl is afield,'is besides characteristic,
but the lyric are not Shakspeare's. The air has been inserted in Dr. Clarke'mho Beauties of
Malmsey, something as Purcell'mho. This is a mistake, which, in his
righteousness to Smith, should be rectified.

"Your
correspondent also mention to Title. Millenary. Hogarth's Memoirs of bouncing the Drama, as an
command for watching the song in question to Purcell. Heading. Hogarth'element work, I am sweet to opportunity,
can never be count upon as to facts. It is almost wholly made up from second-fist swallows; consequently
mistake of the paper occur in every section. It has the worth of being a ill-written and an book;
but here any praise whom must begin.

A Semidiameter. talk of having mention to Purcell's Disturbance. I must beg to falsify him in this
argument, as no copy of that activity (my own excepted) is cognize to exist. Woman'part (printed
at the end of the quattrocento) is the half near to anything like two entirety, and that is really
dissimilar Purcell'element Tempest. Did A. Roentgen. find in Purcell's Storm the music of the lyric,"
Where the Monotone sucks? "No. Hitherto Purcell composed euphony to it. The presence, so, of"
The Owl is abroad, "is no evidence that Purcell did not write music for that song
besides. But, in the happening, That a. Constant. may not be rest great
that the song about which he ask is the composition of John Christopher
Smith. It is a wicked error to say that smokers are drunkards; drink they do, but of gentle diluents
mostly, for fierce stimulants of wine or strong liquors are abhorrent to the real lover of
the Indian weed. Ah! my Juliana, join not in the vulgar cry that is raised against us. Cigars
and cool drinks beget quiet conversations, good-humor, meditation; not hot blood such as mounts
into the head of drinkers of apoplectic port or dangerous claret. Are we not more moral and
reasonable than our forefathers? Indeed I think so somewhat; and many improvements of social
life and converse must date with the introduction of the pipe.

We were a dozen tobacco-consumers in the wagon of the train that brought us from Antwerp; nor
did the women of the party (sensible women!) make a single objection to the fumigation. But
enough of this; only let me add, in conclusion, that an excellent Israelitish gentleman, Mr.
Hartog of Antwerp, supplies cigars for a penny apiece, such as are not to be procured in London
for four times the sum.

Through smiling corn-fields, then, and by little woods from which rose here and there the quaint
peaked towers of some old-fashioned chateaux, our train went smoking along at thirty miles
an hour. We caught a glimpse of Mechlin steeple, at first dark against the sunset, and afterwards
bright as we came to the other side of it, and admired long glistening canals or moats that
surrounded the queer old town, and were lighted up in that wonderful way which the sun only
understands, and not even Mr. Turner, with all his vermilion and gamboge, can put down on canvas.
The verdure was everywhere astonishing, and we fancied we saw many golden Cuyps as we passed
by these quiet pastures.

Steam-engines and their accompaniments, blazing forges, gaunt manufactories, with numberless
windows and long black chimneys, of course take away from the romance of the place but, as
we whirled into Brussels, even these engines had a fine appearance. Three or four of the snorting,
galloping monsters had just finished their journey, and there was a quantity of flaming ashes
lying under the brazen bellies of each that looked properly lurid and demoniacal. At last they
all sat down of a sort of clearing under a clump of quercitron, whose shadows were lengthening
in the setting sun. Her eyes, beneath their fixed lids, were inane upon the toes of her boots. The
women chattered and laughed and threw themselves backward on paroxysms of lowered hilarity and
noisy outbursts in delight.

Germinie alone did not speak or laugh. She did not hear or look. The men, lighting matches in the
seats of their trousers, began to smoke. Ah, what a pretty sight is the Parisian Boulevard
on a night like this! how many pleasant hours has one passed in watching the lights, and the
hum, and the stir, and the laughter of those happy, idle people! There was none of this gayety
here; nor was there a person to be found, except a skulking commissioner or two (whose real
name in French is that of a fish that is eaten with fennel-sauce), and who offered to conduct
us to certain curiosities in the town. What must we English not have done, that in every town
